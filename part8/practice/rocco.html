The New York Times,               Village Voice, Time Out, and New York Magazine all carried extensive               reviews, some publishing more than one article. The critics were               clearly ready for a treatment of this artist, best known for his               construction and serial photographs of two life-sized dolls in various               guises and poses taken between 1933-38. Surprisingly, despite all               the attention, none of the major reviews considered the role of               exhibition design in this &#147;site-specific&#148; installation               at ICP, the only venue, other than to note that it was the work               of famed French designer <a href="http://www.andreeputman.com">Andr&eacute;e               Putman</a>. The assertiveness of her design warrants a deeper discussion               of its how its elements related to the displayed work.<br>              <br>              Curator Therese Lichtenstein&#146;s thesis was more focused than               one typically finds in a show designated as a retrospective. She               was attempting to expand the often limited understanding of Bellmer               as an artist whose work&#146;s meaning is tied strictly to his private               desires and borderline misogyny, and whose discovery by Andr&eacute;               Breton in 1934 allowed him to be accepted into the art historical               canon as a Surrealist. In contrast, Lichtenstein located Bellmer&#146;s               oeuvre within a cross-section of German political and cultural influences               in a way that allowed for social as well as biographical interpretations               of the work. Lichtenstein worked closely with Putman on the concept               of the exhibition and the presentation of the material was an integral               component to expanding the context within which Bellmer&#146;s work               is interpreted.<br>              <br>              The first section of Behind Closed Doors was entitled &#147;Dolls,               Mannequins, Robots.&#148; The emphasis was on Bellmer&#146;s early               career as a painter, typographer, and illustrator in Berlin in the               1920s and early 1930s, where he came under the influence of major               Dada and New Objectivity artists, such as George Grosz, Otto Dix,               and Rudolf Schlichter. These artists were responding to rapid cultural               changes in Germany during the interwar period, including intense               industrialization, the increased presence of women in the public               sphere, and severe economic fluctuations. There were also significant               psychological developments in Bellmer&#146;s life at this time,               as he became sexually obsessed with his adolescent cousin Ursula               who had moved next door. The progression of his fantasy life about               her dovetailed with his viewing a 1932 production of Jacques Offenbach&#146;s               &#147;The Tales of Hoffman.&#148; In the first act, &#147;The Sandman,&#148;               a girlish doll named Olympia comes to life before the loving eyes               of the protagonist, Nathaniel.<br>              <br>              A confluence of this early source material that led Bellmer to begin               construction of his first doll in 1933 was presented in the opening               section with the usual curatorial strategies of selection and juxtaposition:               works by Dix and Schlichter depicting prostitutes; newspaper clippings               about the Hoffman production; and German film stills documenting               the popular but unsettling subjects of automatons and robots in               the face of industrialization. Through various design elements there               was also an attempt to show Bellmer&#146;s private collecting habits               and his fascination with German and French erotica. At the start               of the exhibition, samples of contemporaneous erotic magazines,               postcards, and books on masochism of the kind Bellmer amassed were               displayed in tall vitrines, designed by Putman, which aggressively               cut through the architecture of the galleries (illustration 1).               The printed material was displayed spilling out of antique boxes,               drawers, and cases. These usually &#147;closed&#148; objects served               as metaphors for the private nature of the erotic images that preoccupied               Bellmer and for the sexual nature of his future work using dolls               through which he would act out his fantasies, social anxieties,               and identity issues. 1 The boxes containing the erotica echoed the               object viewers would see as they moved into the next gallery: the               Personal Museum, ca. 1938-70, is a display box Bellmer began to               put together and add to after his mother sent him a box of his childhood               toys in 1931. The toys were sent when his parents relocated to Berlin               from Gleiwitz after Bellmer&#146;s autocratic father suffered a               cerebral hemorrhage, which proved to be another momentous event               for Bellmer in the early 1930s.<sup>2<br>              </sup><br>            </p>            <table width="211" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="184">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rocco_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell5.jpg" width="313" height="211" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="rocco_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b> Section 1, &quot;Dolls, Mannequins, Robots,&quot; with                     the Personal Museum, right,and Bellmer's photographs, left,                     flanking the wall text.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">&nbsp; </p>            <p class="second">In every section and room of this exhibition, Bellmer&#146;s               photographs of both the first and second doll (completed in 1935)               were prominently installed, even in the gallery concerning early               &#147;pre-doll&#148; context. Lichtenstein and Putman wanted to               be certain that the viewer would always have Bellmer&#146;s main               works in mind when considering the mediating influences. Bellmer               produced at least thirty photographs of the first doll, and one               hundred of the second doll, each time changing the pose, states               of dress or undress, hair, accoutrements, and settings, which included               domestic interiors and outdoor scenes. The paint color chosen for               this first section was a sensual, fleshy peach. Combined with the               dolls, the erotica, and the lighting softened by colored gels, it               created the feeling of being in a boudoir, both lovely and somewhat               forbidden (illustration 2). Throughout the exhibition, the lighting--               in combinations of pink, yellow, and orange-- picked up the colors               of the hand-tinting that Bellmer often used on the doll photographs.               The gentleness of the green and pink pastel tints seemed to mock               the violent positions into which he would twist the dolls, and Putman,               along with her lighting designer, Herv&eacute; Descottes, wanted               to achieve a similar ambiguity in the installation.<br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="235" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="120">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rocco_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell2.jpg" width="230" height="156" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth">                     <p><a href="rocco_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig 3: </b></a><a href="rocco_3.html">From                       this viewpoint, the visitor is standing in Section 3, &quot;Bellmer                       and Surrealism,&quot; looking into Section 2, &quot;Bellmer                       in Nazi Germany.&quot; The florescent lights were built                       into the sides of the entry walls.</a></p>                  </div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The second section, &#147;Bellmer in Nazi Germany,&#148;               the crux of Lichtenstein&#146;s thesis, was the most minimal in               design of the three. In this room the content was allowed to speak               more directly for itself. The paint was left a stark white, although               the same lighting scheme was used, this time either illuminating               the works from below, or by installing lighting directly into the               walls of the main entrance of the gallery (illustration 3), which               maintained the sense of being in an alternate realm. Here, the viewer               initially confronted numerous images of the first papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;               doll in poses varying from prostrate and vulnerable, to coy, with               over-the-shoulder glances. Two vitrines, shorter and less dominating               than the aforementioned erotica-filled cases, contained the kind               of Nazi propaganda to which Bellmer would have been constantly subjected               after Hitler took power in 1933. This propaganda included a 1935               edition of the journal Das Deutsche Lichtbild (German Photography),               with photographs of healthy, tanned, Aryan youths, catalogues from               the Great German Art Exhibitions of 1936, 1937, and 1938, Nazi-sponsored               shows of sanctioned artwork, often highlighting Hitler&#146;s favorite               sculptor of classical Greek rip-offs, Arno Brecker, and an original               brochure from the 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in which               the Nazis tried to lay out a cohesive argument that any art relying               on primitivism, expressionism, or pure abstraction was corrosive               to a healthy society. This led Bellmer to declare that he would               no longer make commercial work that contributed in any way to the               economy of the fascist state and to retreat into the studio to create               a body of work that stood in stark contrast to the Nazi program.               His production was a self-proclaimed &#147;remedy, the compensation               for a certain impossibility of living.&#148;<sup>3</sup> <br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="190" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="155">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rocco_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell3.jpg" width="227" height="152" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="rocco_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> In this photograph of Section 2, the house lights are                     on, so the full effect of the lighting design is absent. But                     one can see how the short vitrines containing the National                     Socialist ephemera were placed in relation to Bellmer's photographs                     on the walls, perpendicular to and in front of them.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Examples of how Bellmer&#146;s reaction to this               repressive environment leaked into his work were immediately accessible               to the viewer through the photographs of the second doll that were               placed on walls adjacent to the Nazi-era vitrines (illustration               4). The construction of this doll was more complex than the first               in that the center ball joint Bellmer had fashioned with his brother               Fritz could have numerous appendages attached to it. He often photographed               the doll with multiple legs, and in one piece he hand-tinted angry               red spots on the legs, making them look inflamed with disease, and               thus providing a foil to the sculpted bodies sprinting through the               Nazi magazine pages nearby. Directly behind the vitrines was a disturbing               image of the doll propped against a tree in the woods, with the               shadowy figure of a voyeur standing behind the tree. In a perfect               blend of social and private, the figure functions as a stand-in               for Bellmer and the fantasies he could act out on his dolls,<sup>4</sup>               but concomitantly for the watchful and repressive regime within               which he created work that would be damned as degenerate if discovered.<sup>5<br>              </sup> </p>            <p class="second">An element which allowed Putman to dramatically               foreground her design in this section was the crown jewel of the               installation, the actual second doll (La Poup&eacute;e, dated 1932-45               due to elements of the first doll being incorporated into the second)               which was lent by the Centre Georges Pompidou in France. The work               was located in an intimate room just beyond the gallery with the               Nazi printed material and placed on a platform made to look like               a bed, with two blankets thrown over it on which the doll and her               double pair of legs rested (illustration 5). Putman insisted that               the blankets be the kind used for packing and shipping artwork,               for two reasons: Bellmer used the same type of padded, stitched               blankets as a backdrop for one of his strangest doll photographs,               one with the ball joint and a leg, a bow and blond hair, but no               head, and a long string with a detached eye (see illustration 37               in Lichtenstein); also, the colors one often finds in these blankets               are, like the dolls themselves, a weird mix of sweet and ugly, like               &#147;piss yellow and sucked-lollipop pink.&#148;<sup>6</sup> The               platform was shrouded behind a scrim, and the translucency of this               material combined with theatrical lighting installed along the bottom               of the floor indulged the spectators in voyeuristic pleasures, inviting               them to peek into a forbidden zone in order to get to the core element               of the exhibition. Putman used a similar setting (without the packing               blankets) to display La Poup&eacute;e in the 1998 Guggenheim exhibition               Guggenheim/Pompidou: A Rendezvous.<br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="233" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="201">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rocco_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell4.jpg" width="232" height="151" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div class="sixth"><a href="rocco_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     5:</b></a> Bellmer's second doll (La Poup&eacute;e).

The cases               contained Surrealist books and journals that bore Bellmer&#146;s               influence<sup>7 </sup>spilling out of the boxes and drawers. Breton               and Paul Eluard, the leading poets of the Surrealist movement, were               introduced to Bellmer&#146;s work by his adored cousin Ursula when               she went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. She brought eighteen               photographs of Bellmer&#146;s first doll to Breton and Eluard, who               so admired them that they were published the same year in Minotaure.               The two poets understood that Bellmer&#146;s project was an attempt               to explore the same subversive, sexual realm that they tried to               use in their work as an alternative to the dictates of bourgeois               existence. Since Freud&#146;s sexually-based readings of the subconscious               became a powerful weapon for the Surrealists in this battle against               the bourgeoisie, the boxes, drawers, and valises that contained               the Surrealist journals carried as much metaphorical weight in this               section as in the earlier section with the erotica. Bellmer finally               left Germany in 1938 after his wife&#146;s death, and came to Paris               to join up with these kindred spirits. In the 1940s he began collaborating               with the renegade Surrealist, Georges Bataille, on his book Story               of the Eye. Original dry-point engravings of the illustrations for               the book were installed in wall vitrines toward the end of the exhibition.               Bellmer lived in France for the rest of his life, and the section               on Surrealism thus appropriately functioned as the conclusion to               the retrospective.<br>              <br>              The most successful synthesis of design and content in Behind Closed               Doors was achieved in the first section and in aspects of the second.               The heart and soul of the exhibition&#146;s thesis, namely that               Bellmer&#146;s art was socially engaged, was illuminated in the               middle section on &#147;Bellmer in Nazi Germany.&#148; To that end,               the contrast between the &#147;diseased&#148; doll and &#147;healthy&#148;               Aryans, as well as the presentation of the doll, the object on which               he worked out these ideas in the studio, were critical revelations.               However, the opening section was crucial in establishing a more               nuanced and variegated examination of what drove Bellmer first to               create these dolls and then to photograph them over and over. Erotica,               films, operas, childhood toys, social unease, adolescent crushes:               these sources and sensibilities coalesced in the early 1930s as               the artist began producing his unsettling and subversive oeuvre.               The public met the private in this exhibition, within a framework               of German cultural realities in the 1920s and 1930s. As an installation               piece in and of itself, the first section was a stunning achievement.               All the tools of design were mustered to engage the viewer with               the contextual material: imaginative vitrine design and installation,               lighting, color scheme, and juxtaposition of works with related               ephemera.<br>              <br>              Given the number of prizes (including the Grand Prix National de               la Creation Industrielle from the French Minister of Culture in               1995) and commissions she has won, it is understandable that Putman&#146;s               name would be mentioned by reviewers. But Behind Closed Doors did,               quite literally, recreate the history of Hans Bellmer, and the design               actively interpreted that historical material. In the future, let&#146;s               hope exhibition design will be treated more vigorously by reviewers.               <br>              <br>              Behind Closed Doors: The Art of Hans Bellmer has been named Photography               Exhibition of the Year by the International Association of Art Critics,               and one of the Best of 2001 by Artforum.</p>            <p class="second"><a href="rocco_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="rocco_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2002 P<i>ART</i> and Vanessa Rocco.
