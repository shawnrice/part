The New York Times, Village         Voice, Time Out, and New York Magazine all carried extensive reviews,         some publishing more than one article. The critics were clearly ready         for a treatment of this artist, best known for his construction and serial         photographs of two life-sized dolls in various guises and poses taken         between 1933-38. Surprisingly, despite all the attention, none of the         major reviews considered the role of exhibition design in this &#147;site-specific&#148;         installation at ICP, the only venue, other than to note that it was the         work of famed French designer <a href="http://www.andreeputman.com">Andr&eacute;e         Putman</a>. The assertiveness of her design warrants a deeper discussion         of its how its elements related to the displayed work.<br>        <br>        Curator Therese Lichtenstein&#146;s thesis was more focused than one typically         finds in a show designated as a retrospective. She was attempting to expand         the often limited understanding of Bellmer as an artist whose work&#146;s         meaning is tied strictly to his private desires and borderline misogyny,         and whose discovery by Andr&eacute; Breton in 1934 allowed him to be accepted         into the art historical canon as a Surrealist. In contrast, Lichtenstein         located Bellmer&#146;s oeuvre within a cross-section of German political         and cultural influences in a way that allowed for social as well as biographical         interpretations of the work. Lichtenstein worked closely with Putman on         the concept of the exhibition and the presentation of the material was         an integral component to expanding the context within which Bellmer&#146;s         work is interpreted.<br>        <br>        The first section of Behind Closed Doors was entitled &#147;Dolls, Mannequins,         Robots.&#148; The emphasis was on Bellmer&#146;s early career as a painter,         typographer, and illustrator in Berlin in the 1920s and early 1930s, where         he came under the influence of major Dada and New Objectivity artists,         such as George Grosz, Otto Dix, and Rudolf Schlichter. These artists were         responding to rapid cultural changes in Germany during the interwar period,         including intense industrialization, the increased presence of women in         the public sphere, and severe economic fluctuations. There were also significant         psychological developments in Bellmer&#146;s life at this time, as he         became sexually obsessed with his adolescent cousin Ursula who had moved         next door. The progression of his fantasy life about her dovetailed with         his viewing a 1932 production of Jacques Offenbach&#146;s &#147;The Tales         of Hoffman.&#148; In the first act, &#147;The Sandman,&#148; a girlish         doll named Olympia comes to life before the loving eyes of the protagonist,         Nathaniel.<br>        <br>        A confluence of this early source material that led Bellmer to begin construction         of his first doll in 1933 was presented in the opening section with the         usual curatorial strategies of selection and juxtaposition: works by Dix         and Schlichter depicting prostitutes; newspaper clippings about the Hoffman         production; and German film stills documenting the popular but unsettling         subjects of automatons and robots in the face of industrialization. Through         various design elements there was also an attempt to show Bellmer&#146;s         private collecting habits and his fascination with German and French erotica.         At the start of the exhibition, samples of contemporaneous erotic magazines,         postcards, and books on masochism of the kind Bellmer amassed were displayed         in tall vitrines, designed by Putman, which aggressively cut through the         architecture of the galleries (illustration 1). The printed material was         displayed spilling out of antique boxes, drawers, and cases. These usually         &#147;closed&#148; objects served as metaphors for the private nature         of the erotic images that preoccupied Bellmer and for the sexual nature         of his future work using dolls through which he would act out his fantasies,         social anxieties, and identity issues. 1 The boxes containing the erotica         echoed (anticipated?) the object viewers would see as they moved into         the next gallery: the Personal Museum, ca. 1938-70, is a display box Bellmer         began to put together and add to after his mother sent him a box of his         childhood toys in 1931. The toys were sent when his parents relocated         to Berlin from Gleiwitz after Bellmer&#146;s autocratic father suffered         a cerebral hemorrhage, which proved to be another momentous event for         Bellmer in the early 1930s.<sup>2<br>        </sup><br>      </p>      <table width="211" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="184">        <tr>           <td><a href="rocco_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell5.jpg" width="313" height="211" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> Section 1, &quot;Dolls,               Mannequins, Robots,&quot; with the Personal Museum, right,and Bellmer's               photographs, left, flanking the wall text.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">&nbsp; </p>      <p class="second">In every section and room of this exhibition, Bellmer&#146;s         photographs of both the first and second doll (completed in 1935) were         prominently installed, even in the gallery concerning early &#147;pre-doll&#148;         context. Lichtenstein and Putman wanted to be certain that the viewer         would always have Bellmer&#146;s main works in mind when considering the         mediating influences. Bellmer produced at least thirty photographs of         the first doll, and one hundred of the second doll, each time changing         the pose, states of dress or undress, hair, accoutrements, and settings,         which included domestic interiors and outdoor scenes. The paint color         chosen for this first section was a sensual, fleshy peach. Combined with         the dolls, the erotica, and the lighting softened by colored gels, it         created the feeling of being in a boudoir, both lovely and somewhat forbidden         (illustration 2). Throughout the exhibition, the lighting-- in combinations         of pink, yellow, and orange-- picked up the colors of the hand-tinting         that Bellmer often used on the doll photographs. The gentleness of the         green and pink pastel tints seemed to mock the violent positions into         which he would twist the dolls, and Putman, along with her lighting designer,         Herv&eacute; Descottes, wanted to achieve a similar ambiguity in the installation.<br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="235" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="120">        <tr>           <td><a href="rocco_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell2.jpg" width="230" height="156" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth">               <p><b>Fig 3: </b>From this viewpoint, the visitor is standing in                 Section 3, &quot;Bellmer and Surrealism,&quot; looking into Section                 2, &quot;Bellmer in Nazi Germany.&quot; The florescent lights                 were built into the sides of the entry walls.</p>            </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">The second section, &#147;Bellmer in Nazi Germany,&#148;         the crux of Lichtenstein&#146;s thesis, was the most minimal in design         of the three. In this room the content was allowed to speak more directly         for itself. The paint was left a stark white, although the same lighting         scheme was used, this time either illuminating the works from below, or         by installing lighting directly into the walls of the main entrance of         the gallery (illustration 3), which maintained the sense of being in an         alternate realm. Here, the viewer initially confronted numerous images         of the first papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; doll in poses varying from prostrate         and vulnerable, to coy, with over-the-shoulder glances. Two vitrines,         shorter and less dominating than the aforementioned erotica-filled cases,         contained the kind of Nazi propaganda to which Bellmer would have been         constantly subjected after Hitler took power in 1933. This propaganda         included a 1935 edition of the journal Das Deutsche Lichtbild (German         Photography), with photographs of healthy, tanned, Aryan youths, catalogues         from the Great German Art Exhibitions of 1936, 1937, and 1938, Nazi-sponsored         shows of sanctioned artwork, often highlighting Hitler&#146;s favorite         sculptor of classical Greek rip-offs, Arno Brecker, and an original brochure         from the 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in which the Nazis tried         to lay out a cohesive argument that any art relying on primitivism, expressionism,         or pure abstraction was corrosive to a healthy society. This led Bellmer         to declare that he would no longer make commercial work that contributed         in any way to the economy of the fascist state and to retreat into the         studio to create a body of work that stood in stark contrast to the Nazi         program. His production was a self-proclaimed &#147;remedy, the compensation         for a certain impossibility of living.&#148;<sup>3</sup> <br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="190" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="155">        <tr>           <td><a href="rocco_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell3.jpg" width="227" height="152" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4:</b> In this photograph               of Section 2, the house lights are on, so the full effect of the               lighting design is absent. But one can see how the short vitrines               containing the National Socialist ephemera were placed in relation               to Bellmer's photographs on the walls, perpendicular to and in front               of them.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">Examples of how Bellmer&#146;s reaction to this repressive         environment leaked into his work were immediately accessible to the viewer         through the photographs of the second doll that were placed on walls adjacent         to the Nazi-era vitrines (illustration 4). The construction of this doll         was more complex than the first in that the center ball joint Bellmer         had fashioned with his brother Fritz could have numerous appendages attached         to it. He often photographed the doll with multiple legs, and in one piece         he hand-tinted angry red spots on the legs, making them look inflamed         with disease, and thus providing a foil to the sculpted bodies sprinting         through the Nazi magazine pages nearby. Directly behind the vitrines was         a disturbing image of the doll propped against a tree in the woods, with         the shadowy figure of a voyeur standing behind the tree. In a perfect         blend of social and private, the figure functions as a stand-in for Bellmer         and the fantasies he could act out on his dolls,<sup>4</sup> but concomitantly         for the watchful and repressive regime within which he created work that         would be damned as degenerate if discovered.<sup>5<br>        </sup> </p>      <p class="second">An element which allowed Putman to dramatically foreground         her design in this section was the crown jewel of the installation, the         actual second doll (La Poup&eacute;e, dated 1932-45 due to elements of         the first doll being incorporated into the second) which was lent by the         Centre Georges Pompidou in France. The work was located in an intimate         room just beyond the gallery with the Nazi printed material and placed         on a platform made to look like a bed, with two blankets thrown over it         on which the doll and her double pair of legs rested (illustration 5).         Putman insisted that the blankets be the kind used for packing and shipping         artwork, for two reasons: Bellmer used the same type of padded, stitched         blankets as a backdrop for one of his strangest doll photographs, one         with the ball joint and a leg, a bow and blond hair, but no head, and         a long string with a detached eye (see illustration 37 in Lichtenstein);         also, the colors one often finds in these blankets are, like the dolls         themselves, a weird mix of sweet and ugly, like &#147;piss yellow and         sucked-lollipop pink.&#148;<sup>6</sup> The platform was shrouded behind         a scrim, and the translucency of this material combined with theatrical         lighting installed along the bottom of the floor indulged the spectators         in voyeuristic pleasures, inviting them to peek into a forbidden zone         in order to get to the core element of the exhibition. Putman used a similar         setting (without the packing blankets) to display La Poup&eacute;e in         the 1998 Guggenheim exhibition Guggenheim/Pompidou: A Rendezvous.<br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="233" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="201">        <tr>           <td><a href="rocco_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="bell4.jpg" width="232" height="151" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 5:</b> Plan your day to prevent               fatigue.

The cases contained Surrealist         books and journals that bore Bellmer&#146;s influence<sup>7 </sup>spilling         out of the boxes and drawers. Breton and Paul Eluard, the leading poets         of the Surrealist movement, were introduced to Bellmer&#146;s work by         his adored cousin Ursula when she went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne.         She brought eighteen photographs of Bellmer&#146;s first doll to Breton         and Eluard, who so admired them that they were published the same year         in Minotaure. The two poets understood that Bellmer&#146;s project was         an attempt to explore the same subversive, sexual realm that they tried         to use in their work as an alternative to the dictates of bourgeois existence.         Since Freud&#146;s sexually-based readings of the subconscious became         a powerful weapon for the Surrealists in this battle against the bourgeoisie,         the boxes, drawers, and valises that contained the Surrealist journals         carried as much metaphorical weight in this section as in the earlier         section with the erotica. Bellmer finally left Germany in 1938 after his         wife&#146;s death, and came to Paris to join up with these kindred spirits.         In the 1940s he began collaborating with the renegade Surrealist, Georges         Bataille, on his book Story of the Eye. Original dry-point engravings         of the illustrations for the book were installed in wall vitrines toward         the end of the exhibition. Bellmer lived in France for the rest of his         life, and the section on Surrealism thus appropriately functioned as the         conclusion to the retrospective.<br>        <br>        The most successful synthesis of design and content in Behind Closed Doors         was achieved in the first section and in aspects of the second. The heart         and soul of the exhibition&#146;s thesis, namely that Bellmer&#146;s art         was socially engaged, was illuminated in the middle section on &#147;Bellmer         in Nazi Germany.&#148; To that end, the contrast between the &#147;diseased&#148;         doll and &#147;healthy&#148; Aryans, as well as the presentation of the         doll, the object on which he worked out these ideas in the studio, were         critical revelations. However, the opening section was crucial in establishing         a more nuanced and variegated examination of what drove Bellmer first         to create these dolls and then to photograph them over and over. Erotica,         films, operas, childhood toys, social unease, adolescent crushes: these         sources and sensibilities coalesced in the early 1930s as the artist began         producing his unsettling and subversive oeuvre. The public met the private         in this exhibition, within a framework of German cultural realities in         the 1920s and 1930s. As an installation piece in and of itself, the first         section was a stunning achievement. All the tools of design were mustered         to engage the viewer with the contextual material: imaginative vitrine         design and installation, lighting, color scheme, and juxtaposition of         works with related ephemera.<br>        <br>        Given the number of prizes (including the Grand Prix National de la Creation         Industrielle from the French Minister of Culture in 1995) and commissions         she has won, it is understandable that Putman&#146;s name would be mentioned         by reviewers. But Behind Closed Doors did, quite literally, recreate the         history of Hans Bellmer, and the design actively interpreted that historical         material. In the future, let&#146;s hope exhibition design will be treated         more vigorously by reviewers. <br>        <br>        Behind Closed Doors: The Art of Hans Bellmer has been named Photography         Exhibition of the Year by the International Association of Art Critics,         and one of the Best of 2001 by Artforum.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        &nbsp;     </body></html>
