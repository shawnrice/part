The premise of the project is outlined in an uncredited               text at the beginning of the book version of Gymnasium, which extols               the idealized athletic boy at the expense of angst-ridden, academics-obsessed               adolescents who spend far too many hours brooding in their rooms.               &#147;It is the boys who have snap and vim and energy, who have               a plentiful supply of &#145;ginger,&#146;&#148; Smalley quotes (or               writes himself, in which case his text is a masterful recreation               of what might be called the Boy Scout Handbook aesthetic), &#147;that               accomplish results of importance...The boy who wants to be strong               and rugged, who wishes to grow up into a superb, manly man, and               who uses his surplus energies and wholesome games and in a temperate               amount of study, will avoid without the slightest effort all that               is evil.&#148;<sup>1</sup><br>              <br>              There are plenty of viewers who might athletically leap over the               irony here and suggest that it is precisely the kind of behavior               learned on the playing field and in the locker room that creates               a specific kind of evil rather than subverting it, but Smalley is               having none of that. His boy athletes are sweet looking, serene,               confident, supremely unself-conscious. They pose in old football               helmets, on antique rowing machines, with cheerleaders&#146; megaphones,               and they wear old-style uniforms, wrestling singlets and lettered               jerseys. All the photos are in black and white; virtually all of               the athletes gaze directly into the camera; most are in sharp focus,               though the occasional boy and some of the backgrounds are rendered               in a gauzy Pictorialist haze. The pictures seem designed to summon               nostalgia, an era of innocent athleticism when high school males               did not shoot one another and the presumed meaning of sport itself               was still pure, and Smalley&#146;s photos are, unto themselves,               beautiful objects fashioned by a gifted photographic craftsman.<br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="169" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="159">              <tr>                 <td><img src="gr/smalley2.jpg" width="200" height="156"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="file:///C|/My%20Documents/PART%20content/part7/articles/buschk_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b> </a><br>                    Luke Smalley.

The artifice on display here,               that of consciously relocating the subject in time and space, is               deeply embedded in photographic history. Unlikely as it may seem,               the true progenitors of Smalley&#146;s work are the constructed               tableaux of nineteenth century photographers like Oscar Rejlander               and Henry Peach Robinson, perhaps even the allegorical portraits               Julia Margaret Cameron made of friends and family in the 1860s and               70s.<sup>2</sup> One can also cite the more contemporary works of               Philip-Lorca DiCorcia and Cindy Sherman, two photographers (among               many) who take as the subject of their photography questions of               constructed identity and the ambiguous nature of photographic &#147;truth.&#148;<sup>3</sup>               More obvious even to the casual observer is Smalley&#146;s debt               to a longstanding and diverse tradition of homoerotic subject matter               in photography. In this sense, the photos in Gymnasium are derived               from Wilhelm von Gloeden and Fred Holland Day&#146;s early twentieth               century work and updated by way of Bruce Weber, though divested               of nudity and any overt sensuality along the way.<sup>4</sup> The               youngest subject in Gymnasium, a buzz-cut boy wearing black trunks               and nothing else, could in fact have stepped from the frames of               &#147;Broken Noses,&#148; Weber&#146;s 1987 cinematic gaze at a               boys&#146; boxing club in the Pacific Northwest. For all Weber&#146;s               contrivance, though, for all the hair gel and moody lighting and               naked romping with dogs and each other, he allows his subjects a               naturalism that Smalley&#146;s more narrowly defined athletes do               not have. We know nothing about them outside of their fabricated               contexts; they are unnamed, the photos themselves untitled, and               the boys have been stripped of everything but their bodies, their               poses, their unmediated gaze at the lens.<br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="158" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="134">              <tr>                 <td><img src="gr/smalley3.jpg" width="200" height="135"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="file:///C|/My%20Documents/PART%20content/part7/articles/buschk_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> </a><br>                    Luke Smalley.

These boys are physical               paradigms all, embodiments of body, for the most part unsmiling,               willing participants in the recording of body-glory. There are no               depictions of athletes of color and a tacit nod to contemporary               gay aesthetics of beauty (no body hair to be seen on Smalley&#146;s               athletes, no bad complexions, no one fat or misshapen or conventionally               ugly). Smalley seems most interested in documenting a nostalgic               history of the primal urge boys have to play games, to test themselves,               to measure athletic prowess, to achieve athletic success. There               isn&#146;t much about the thrill of victory here, though the emotions               of defeat are also all but absent. In one photo, a boy sits alone               on a throne-like chair, wearing white shorts, a pair of antique               cleats and a banner across his perfect bare chest that proclaims               &#147;FIRST.&#148; The boy&#146;s face is blank; he sits like a               prince unimpressed or even unaware of his kingdom. In another photo,               a quintet of boys sit on enormous rolled hay bales, balancing basketballs               on their heads with their left hands, their right hands dangling               between splayed legs. They do this not because they reenact some               forgotten ritual of gymnasium culture but because Smalley thought               this would make an interesting composition. (In a companion photo,               the same quintet stands on the hay bales and now balances the balls               on their heads with their right hands.) The expressions on the boys&#146;               faces, though hard to read from a distance, appear as uninflected               as the seated boy with his banner. They are plainly not thinking               about artifice and the construction of nostalgia and the homoerotic               gaze; they are doing what Smalley told them to do, and that seems               enough.<br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="90" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="205">              <tr>                 <td><img src="gr/smalley4.jpg" width="132" height="200"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="file:///C|/My%20Documents/PART%20content/part7/articles/buschk_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> </a><br>                    Luke Smalley. Untitled (from Gymnasium [Santa Fe: Twin Palms                     <br>                    Publishers, <br>                    2001])</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>The unasked question in Gymnasium is not necessarily one about               the artist&#146;s intention (which seems clear enough) or about               the propriety of studying and documenting adolescent sexuality (however               peripheral this is in Smalley&#146;s photos). It is instead a question               about fabricated identity and possibly fabricated desire. Smalley&#146;s               work taps into the twin grails of contemporary advertising culture,               youth and beauty (and the longing for both). He aestheticizes his               subjects, strips them of sweat, grime, blood and the smells of locker               room and playing field, strips them as well of the pervasive sports-based               and gym-class cruelty which presumably dominates the adolescent               memories of most non-athletes. Smalley&#146;s athletes are purified,               in other words, in form but also in sensibility. This further distances               us (and them) from the complicated contemporary reality of sports,               from the troubling issues of adolescent sexual allure. These photos,               because of the obvious inaccessibility of their subjects, create               a kind of illicit (and unfulfillable) longing, an impossible desire               which is paradoxically permitted only in the act of looking at the               photos themselves. Are any of his high school athletes gay? Are               any of them aware that the majority of the viewing audience for               Smalley&#146;s photos are likely to be gay men? Would they care               if they knew? In the orderly and nostalgic world of Gymnasium, none               of the answers seem to matter.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="turnbu_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2002 P<i>ART</i> and Richard Turnbull.
