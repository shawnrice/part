Smalley&#146;s work   is not the stuff of celebratory small town photojournalism but rather an elaborately   crafted and posed body of photos whose participants, though real athletes (Smalley   found them in various Pennsylvania and Ohio high schools), act out a series   of scenarios using antique athletic equipment, much of it fashioned by Smalley   himself. The premise of the project is outlined in an uncredited text at the   beginning of the book version of Gymnasium, which extols the idealized athletic   boy at the expense of angst-ridden, academics-obsessed adolescents who spend   far too many hours brooding in their rooms. &#147;It is the boys who have snap   and vim and energy, who have a plentiful supply of &#145;ginger,&#146;&#148;   Smalley quotes (or writes himself, in which case his text is a masterful recreation   of what might be called the Boy Scout Handbook aesthetic), &#147;that accomplish   results of importance...The boy who wants to be strong and rugged, who wishes   to grow up into a superb, manly man, and who uses his surplus energies and wholesome   games and in a temperate amount of study, will avoid without the slightest effort   all that is evil.&#148;<sup>1</sup><br>  <br>  There are plenty of viewers who might athletically leap over the irony here   and suggest that it is precisely the kind of behavior learned on the playing   field and in the locker room that creates a specific kind of evil rather than   subverting it, but Smalley is having none of that. His boy athletes are sweet   looking, serene, confident, supremely unself-conscious. They pose in old football   helmets, on antique rowing machines, with cheerleaders&#146; megaphones, and   they wear old-style uniforms, wrestling singlets and lettered jerseys. All the   photos are in black and white; virtually all of the athletes gaze directly into   the camera; most are in sharp focus, though the occasional boy and some of the   backgrounds are rendered in a gauzy Pictorialist haze. The pictures seem designed   to summon nostalgia, an era of innocent athleticism when high school males did   not shoot one another and the presumed meaning of sport itself was still pure,   and Smalley&#146;s photos are, unto themselves, beautiful objects fashioned   by a gifted photographic craftsman.<br>  <br></p><table width="169" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="159">  <tr>     <td><img src="gr/smalley2.jpg" width="200" height="156"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">     <td>       <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="file:///C|/My%20Documents/PART%20content/part7/articles/buschk_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig         2:</b> </a><br>        Luke Smalley.

The artifice on display here, that of consciously relocating   the subject in time and space, is deeply embedded in photographic history. Unlikely   as it may seem, the true progenitors of Smalley&#146;s work are the constructed   tableaux of nineteenth century photographers like Oscar Rejlander and Henry   Peach Robinson, perhaps even the allegorical portraits Julia Margaret Cameron   made of friends and family in the 1860s and 70s.<sup>2</sup> One can also cite   the more contemporary works of Philip-Lorca DiCorcia and Cindy Sherman, two   photographers (among many) who take as the subject of their photography questions   of constructed identity and the ambiguous nature of photographic &#147;truth.&#148;<sup>3</sup>   More obvious even to the casual observer is Smalley&#146;s debt to a longstanding   and diverse tradition of homoerotic subject matter in photography. In this sense,   the photos in Gymnasium are derived from Wilhelm von Gloeden and Fred Holland   Day&#146;s early twentieth century work and updated by way of Bruce Weber, though   divested of nudity and any overt sensuality along the way.<sup>4</sup> The youngest   subject in Gymnasium, a buzz-cut boy wearing black trunks and nothing else,   could in fact have stepped from the frames of &#147;Broken Noses,&#148; Weber&#146;s   1987 cinematic gaze at a boys&#146; boxing club in the Pacific Northwest. For   all Weber&#146;s contrivance, though, for all the hair gel and moody lighting   and naked romping with dogs and each other, he allows his subjects a naturalism   that Smalley&#146;s more narrowly defined athletes do not have. We know nothing   about them outside of their fabricated contexts; they are unnamed, the photos   themselves untitled, and the boys have been stripped of everything but their   bodies, their poses, their unmediated gaze at the lens.<br>  <br></p><table width="158" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="134">  <tr>     <td><img src="gr/smalley3.jpg" width="200" height="135"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">     <td>       <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="file:///C|/My%20Documents/PART%20content/part7/articles/buschk_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig         3:</b> </a><br>        Luke Smalley. Untitled (from Gymnasium [Santa Fe: Twin Palms <br>        Publishers, <br>        2001])</div>    </td>  </tr></table><p>Gymnasium is boy after boy, crouching, lifting, hurling, running, rowing, lunging,   in pairs, in trios, alone. These boys are physical paradigms all, embodiments   of body, for the most part unsmiling, willing participants in the recording   of body-glory. There are no depictions of athletes of color and a tacit nod   to contemporary gay aesthetics of beauty (no body hair to be seen on Smalley&#146;s   athletes, no bad complexions, no one fat or misshapen or conventionally ugly).   Smalley seems most interested in documenting a nostalgic history of the primal   urge boys have to play games, to test themselves, to measure athletic prowess,   to achieve athletic success. There isn&#146;t much about the thrill of victory   here, though the emotions of defeat are also all but absent. In one photo, a   boy sits alone on a throne-like chair, wearing white shorts, a pair of antique   cleats and a banner across his perfect bare chest that proclaims &#147;FIRST.&#148;   The boy&#146;s face is blank; he sits like a prince unimpressed or even unaware   of his kingdom. In another photo, a quintet of boys sit on enormous rolled hay   bales, balancing basketballs on their heads with their left hands, their right   hands dangling between splayed legs. They do this not because they reenact some   forgotten ritual of gymnasium culture but because Smalley thought this would   make an interesting composition. (In a companion photo, the same quintet stands   on the hay bales and now balances the balls on their heads with their right   hands.) The expressions on the boys&#146; faces, though hard to read from a   distance, appear as uninflected as the seated boy with his banner. They are   plainly not thinking about artifice and the construction of nostalgia and the   homoerotic gaze; they are doing what Smalley told them to do, and that seems   enough.<br>  <br></p><table width="90" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="205">  <tr>     <td><img src="gr/smalley4.jpg" width="132" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr valign="top">     <td>       <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="file:///C|/My%20Documents/PART%20content/part7/articles/buschk_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig         4:</b> </a><br>        Luke Smalley.

It is instead a question about fabricated identity and possibly fabricated   desire. Smalley&#146;s work taps into the twin grails of contemporary advertising   culture, youth and beauty (and the longing for both). He aestheticizes his subjects,   strips them of sweat, grime, blood and the smells of locker room and playing   field, strips them as well of the pervasive sports-based and gym-class cruelty   which presumably dominates the adolescent memories of most non-athletes. Smalley&#146;s   athletes are purified, in other words, in form but also in sensibility. This   further distances us (and them) from the complicated contemporary reality of   sports, from the troubling issues of adolescent sexual allure. These photos,   because of the obvious inaccessibility of their subjects, create a kind of illicit   (and unfulfillable) longing, an impossible desire which is paradoxically permitted   only in the act of looking at the photos themselves. Are any of his high school   athletes gay? Are any of them aware that the majority of the viewing audience   for Smalley&#146;s photos are likely to be gay men? Would they care if they   knew? In the orderly and nostalgic world of Gymnasium, none of the answers seem   to matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
