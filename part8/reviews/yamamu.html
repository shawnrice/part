I&#146;m Lebanese,               and this is my country. Where am I to go?&#146;&#148;<sup>1</sup>               F&#146;s reply suddenly makes Darwish become aware of his status               as an exile, and the void created in a space where his home was               supposed to be. Darwish was born in Upper Galilee, present- day               Haifa in Israel. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, he and his family               fled to Lebanon.<sup>2</sup> This seemingly distant event cannot               be distanced from the tragedy that took place here in New York.               Since 1982, the U.S.-Israeli relationship has been constantly provoking               the Arab world&#146;s antipathy toward this country. Later, this               exile from Galilee for thirty-one years writes: &#147;We have traveled               like other people, but we / return to nowhere / we have a country               of words.&#148;<sup>3</sup><br>              <br>              Because of political and economic conditions, nearly 100 million               people are displaced from their geographical boundaries of home,               and this unparalleled level of demographic change is profoundly               challenging our world&#146;s most basic notions of community, nation,               culture, and citizenship.<sup>4</sup> For many &eacute;migr&eacute;s,               home is no longer a physical geographical boundary, but where their               memory resides.<br>              <br>              If words are home to a Palestinian exile, visual expression can               be regarded as a home to Allan deSouza, a second-generation immigrant.               No single country claims deSouza, who was born in Kenya to Goan               parents. His family&#146;s move from their home, the former Portuguese               colony of Goa, India to Kenya was mainly for economic reasons. With               Kenya&#146;s independence, the deSouzas moved to Great Britain,               and currently deSouza resides in Los Angeles. In his ongoing series               of works begun in 1999, entitled Terrains, deSouza creates fictional               landscapes&#151;what he calls &#147;fabricated, tabletop landscape               models&#148; (Fig. 1). The void as homeland also exists in deSouza&#146;s               works. Being twice removed from his place of birth, deSouza has               a strong longing for a homeland. As he described it, Terrains is               an effort to &#147;externalize those emotions of longing to undo               their hold [and] view them from a distance.&#148; He obsessively               introduces objects from everyday life, often from his own body,               such as earwax, eyelashes, and fingernail clippings, in his artificial               landscapes. DeSouza then photographs such fabricated landscapes,               computer-scans the negatives, and manipulates them in the manner               of painting. Such painstaking acts to reclaim the void, the longing               for and belonging to home, by fabricating imaginary landscapes,               open up a new page in the American landscape tradition.<br>              <br>              In Allan deSouza: Recent Works, held at <a href="http://www.talwargallery.com">Talwar               Gallery</a> , one room exhibited such works dealing mainly with               body parts. Filling the void with a particular presence&#151;such               as his bodily detritus&#151;and using photography, deSouza&#146;s               work can most effectively be interpreted from the photographical               index. Traditionally, the paintings can be regarded as Symbolic,               as it enters into human consciousness through pictorial representation               by forming a connection between objects and their meanings. This               relationship, however, does not apply to photography, because photography               is the result of a physical imprint, or index, transferred by light               reflection onto light-sensitive paper. The separation of the image               from the actual presence of the object disallows the process of               schematization. Photography is a place, filled with signification,               that operates between different shifters and becomes the culture               of reception.<sup>5</sup><br>              <br>              The &#147;shifter&#148; is a category of linguistic signs introduced               by the linguist Roman Jacobson, which is filled with significance,               only because it is empty. The word &#145;this&#146; is such a sign,               waiting each time to be supplied with its referents. The personal               pronouns &#145;I&#146; and &#145;you&#146; are also shifters that               shift according to their users. Because of its nature, in the early               development of a child, the acquisition for the uses of the shifter,               &#147;I&#148; and &#147;you&#148; is the last thing to be correctly               learned, and often, in the case of speech in autistic children,               the use of personal pronouns collapses and becomes reversed.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              DeSouza, however, moves one step further from the photographical               index through the added process of image manipulation. DeSouza deliberately               fabricates the Symbolic with a falsehood in order to expose another.               For example, in his rhetorically fashioned landscape photography,               which resembles nineteenth century barren landscape paintings, in               comparison to representative nineteenth century American Romantic               landscape paintings, such as the works by Thomas Cole, we see that               his work does not convey any fixed ideas. Rather it presents its               readers with something uncanny; in many cases, it even betrays our               expectation of finding any representations of landscape. In this               process, the reader ought to fill a falsehood with signifiers from               his or her own reservoir to produce meaning in deSouza&#146;s landscape.               Such process heightens the reader&#146;s reception toward the constitution               of Symbolic, as often, the Symbolic entails both historical and               social frameworks preexistent to the reader&#146;s own being. <br>              <br>              Leading a nomadic life, deSouza has a rather ambiguous cultural               identity. Usually, as pointed out by the Palestinian-American intellectual               Edward Said, culture serves as a source of identity, helping us               to see ourselves, our people, and tradition in the best light. &#147;In               time,&#148; Said writes, &#147;this differentiates &#145;us&#146;               from &#145;them.&#146;&#148;<sup>6</sup> Such is not the case for deSouza.               Here, we may expand the concept of shifter from personal pronouns               to geographical boundaries or countries. As deSouza moved from one               continent to another, every time, the shifter changed and produced               a different significance, resulting in a complex vision.<br>              This flux in vision generated by living in different parts of the               world gives deSouza a good reason to challenge the Symbolic that               exists in any given society. For example, his deliberate use of               the nineteenth century pictorial American landscape tradition questions               the social and cultural constitutions of the U.S. In the nineteenth               century, American Romanticism played an active role in establishing               a specific American identity. According to the art historians James               Soby and Dorothy Miller, American Romantic tradition &#147;came               into being in London with Benjamin West, as part of the European               movement, and brought to this country in the early 19th century.&#148;<sup>7</sup>              The art historian Oswaldo Roque makes a similar observation. British               cultural identity, therefore, is crucial in the establishment of               American identity. Roque also sees that major human concerns, such               as a people&#146;s morality, a nation&#146;s mission, and the future,               found their way into works of art in this period.<sup>8</sup> Such ideas               presented by the artist find ways to connect to the establishment               of nationalism. For example, a nineteenth century former mayor of               New York, Philip Hone, said: &#147;I think every American is bound               to prove his love of country by admiring Cole. &#148;<sup>9</sup> This statement               confirms for us the connection between culture and nationalism.               Remembering that the Romanticism in America began as part of the               European movement, in terms of institutional nationalism, the U.S.               worked from European models to fabricate a linear historiography               since the time of independence. On the other hand, America is an               immigrant settler society superimposed on the ruins of a considerable               native presence, and American identity is too varied to be unitary               and homogenous. DeSouza&#146;s seeming adherence to the nineteenth               century landscape tradition is a re-examination of the notion of               unitary identity, and linear and subsumed history, where he sees               the whole as complex, hybrid, heterogeneous, and un-monolithic.<sup>10</sup><br>              <br>              A Blurring of the World, a Refocusing Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days               Maybe Years Later, with Everything Put Together Differently, in               Ways He Doesn&#146;t Understand, is the latest work by deSouza exhibited               at Talwar Gallery. The title suggests how our perception of an event               alters by different moments, and finally becomes something entirely               different from what originally had took place. This specific work               evokes the event that took place on the morning of September 11th.               However, as one recovers from the initial shock caused by this work,               one discovers that the scene is composed of mischievously arranged               discarded computer chips, thin blue lines, inserted images of the               flickering flames and the tailing smoke. There are no Twin Towers               or crashing airplanes depicted here. Much of what evokes the events               of 9/11 owes to the power of mass media that has harped incessantly               on the unbearable suffering, consequently evoking a chilling patriotism,               and reasserting a worn-out nationalism in a multiracial, and multicultural               environment. <br>              <br>              In reality, only the title of the work came after September 11th,               forging a more concrete relationship between the work and the tragedy.<sup>11</sup>               DeSouza happened to create this work about a month prior to the               9/11 event, when he traveled and lived in Donegal, Ireland and heard               about sectarian violence that takes place in Northern Ireland.<br>              <br>              DeSouza&#146;s American landscape manifestation, which does not               seek to forge any concrete connection between objects and their               meanings, operates contrary to the traditional relationship between               object and idea entailed in painting. This traditional relationship               often insistently connects culture and nationalism. Such insistence,               as Said points out, only ends up in the &#147;awful din of unending               strife, and a bloody political mess.&#148;<sup>12</sup> On the other hand,               keeping in mind the concept of &#147;shifter,&#148; we recognize               that &#147;self&#148; and &#147;other&#148; can also be regarded               as artifice. DeSouza&#146;s fictional homeland, constituted of his               memories and thoughts living a nomadic life, works to reveal contradictions               inhabiting static or Symbolic ideas in a given society, and thus               brings the world into more layered and complex place. </p>            <p class="second"><a href="yamamu_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="yamamu_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             <p class="second"><br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Jennifer Farrell.
