While their scale alone was arresting, there was certainly more   to these images than the concept of &quot;bigger is better.&quot; The tremendous   presence of these two groups of pictures-Walker Evans murals at Andrea Rosen   Gallery and <i>heads</i> by Philip-Lorca diCorcia at Pace Wildenstein, Chelsea-had   a big impact, each in its own way related to scale: in Evans' case, due to its   subversion of photographic transparency; and in diCorcia's, due to its captivating   reconstruction of social vision.</p><p class="second"> The Evans exhibition, on view from September 4 through October   27, 2001, consisted of five mural-sized prints, each measuring approximately   six-by-eight feet. Mounted on Masonite, these gelatin silver prints were among   thirteen that Evans printed at this scale for his 1971 retrospective at the   Museum of Modern Art, New York. Each large panel has been assembled from two   complementary halves that together form a kind of photographic diptych. Their   mounting in this exhibit reveals six screw holes in each panel--twelve for each   image--used during their installation as backdrops in 1971. The bared white   edges of the Masonite, scratched and marred in some places, make it possible   to see where the Masonite stops and the photograph begins. Together, the exposed   screw holes and edges suggest these panels' contemporary status as artifacts   of museum history. The project seems as determined to collapse the boundary   between image and mount as it is to question the distinction between a photograph   and the objects it records.</p><p class="second"> Each image Evans selected for this project is devoid of people,   but human presence touches every aspect of what is photographed: from the bent   fork tines in an Alabama sharecropper's shack to a hand-lettered shoe shine   advertisement; from the outside of identical houses behind a wall of movie billboards   (the most prominent one featuring a battered Carole Lombard) to the delicately   embroidered pillow on a shrimp fisherman's bed. Such unpeopled images are not   unusual in Evans' oeuvre, but humans' consistent absence here suggests careful   selection by Evans himself (or the curator, John Szarkowski). But what else   makes this group of pictures cohere? </p><p class="second">Each photograph has a strong physicality: the stained and strained   slats of wood to which a silverware rack is tacked; the smooth walls hung with   religious images; the peeling paint on a dormant billboard. Each photograph   depicts either wood or board, virtually doubling its physicality. The wit of   a photograph of a billboard (however run-down) being itself turned into a billboard   is obvious, but perhaps more important is its ability to erase the line so often   drawn between art and artifact, creative masterpiece and everyday object. This   is not to say that Evans does not have the skill of an art photographer; he   does. With these photographs, he has transformed would-be art photographs into   something far more complex: neither simply art nor mere object.</p><p class="second"> This accomplishment may go a long way toward explaining the   impact of those empty screw holes on the surface of the panels. One wonders   why Evans (never the art photographer envisioned by Alfred Stieglitz) would   have printed such magnificently large photographs only to bore holes in them.   But these holes are the only feature disturbing the transparency of these images   as photographs, a characteristic of the medium we frequently overlook. As Roland   Barthes wrote in <i>Camera Lucida</i>: &quot;Whatever it grants to vision and   whatever its manner, a photograph is always invisible: it is not it that we   see.&quot; 1 This informs the statement, &quot;It's such-and-such,&quot; as   opposed to, &quot;It's a photograph of such-and-such.&quot; It is perhaps an   even easier slip of the tongue-and mind-to do this when a photograph is large   and its content may be life-sized. It would be easy to do this before Evans'   pictures, if not for these holes. Nowhere are we so lulled into easy looking   than with <i>Kitchen Wall, Alabama Farmstead</i> (1936). A quick glance might   register these holes as a few more nails in the kitchen wall itself. The physicality   of these panels and the holes in them make certain that we remember that these   holes are not nails any more than this photograph <i>is</i> a kitchen wall. </p><p class="second"> A different, yet equally certain, reminder is manifest in Philip-Lorca   diCorcia's most recent work, heads (1999-2001). In these seventeen color photographs--measuring   four-by-five feet--diCorcia has captured some happenstance pedestrians in Times   Square, with the help of a radio signal, a strobe light, and some twenty feet   of distance. With the photographer and his camera positioned well out of view,   the radio signal prompted a strobe concealed in scaffolding that isolated unsuspecting   passersby in a lit instant. The effect is remarkable: a well-lit figure or group   emerges from such complete blackness into the glow of the strobe that it is   almost inconceivable that diCorcia made these pictures at noon and not midnight.   These people were singled out not only by diCorcia's light, but also by their   membership in a group of seventeen printed from over four thousand photographed.   2 Approximately life-sized, diCorcia's subjects invite our inspection, a prolonged   version of the unsolicited, studying looks doled out every day, on every city   street. These are portraits of social vision itself. </p><p class="second"> Like other street photographs before them, DiCorcia's heads   afford a more leisurely consideration of the persons pictured than everyday   encounters can allow. According to Luc Sante, writing in the accompanying catalogue,   diCorcia offers up a fiction, not the &quot;unvarnished, unprocessed, and unpremeditated   truth&quot; of Walker Evans or Harry Callahan. 3 Yet, whatever &quot;truth&quot;   might be gleaned from an Evans photograph of a subway rider or a Callahan of   Chicago pedestrians is just as fictional. This fiction is of the sort we hastily   compose as we walk down an avenue. Is it not, after all, the freedom to do this   unabashedly that constitutes the irresistible lure of the street photograph?   It is all the more ironic that our attraction to such photographs is predicated   on a conviction that the camera is never pointed at us. To read a person, to   construct her or his identity from a variety of what we take to be &quot;signifiers&quot;   is to do nothing less than to draft a fiction. The privileged intimacy experienced   before DiCorcia's <i>heads</i> indulges our urge to compose as we will. While   a fair-haired teenage girl or a businessman might seem to embody a certain type,   a certain &quot;identity,&quot; the artist himself has said, &quot;Most of the   time, people&#133; present themselves as clich&eacute;s of what they should   be.&quot; 4 Still, before these pictures, one encounters oneself reflected in   the interminable blackness surrounding the figures. At this point comes the   chilling reminder that it is our type, our character that has fashioned the   entire fiction. </p></body></html>
