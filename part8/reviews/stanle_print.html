Well       known for his monochrome explorations of portraiture, this show of ten large-scale       photographs included the facades of gothic cathedrals and corporate high       rises, buildings of archetypal recognition. Fischer&#146;s presentation       of the gothic with the modern is hardly spurious. The soaring, light-filled       skeletal volumes of the gothic cathedral were sources of inspiration for       early skyscraper designs by Berlin architects in the 1920s and 30s, in particular       Mies van der Rohe&#146;s expressionist glass skyscrapers. This formal continuity       is revealed through Fischer&#146;s superimposition of the interior of the       gothic cathedral with exterior views. In Fischer&#146;s combination, the       stone fa&ccedil;ade weaves into the erupting forms of the interior space.       The stone exterior dissolves into an array of geometric forms, reenacting       the great transformations in architectural form precipitated by the construction       of the Crystal Palace of 1851, a building now seen as the earliest precursor       of the glass architecture of the modern office building. The diamond-shaped       verticals of the pointed arches appear to peel open from the dark shell       of the interior, introducing an organic quality of movement into the static       iconography of the cathedral. As the image itself is crucial for Fischer,       the superimposition of interior/exterior opens up new visual territory.       In line with Fischer&#146;s disruption of the stone fa&ccedil;ade, Monet       declared, regarding his Cathedral series, that &#147;everything changes,       even stone,&#148; to express his intentions to capture the shifting conditions       of light and vapor that surrounded the fa&ccedil;ade of the Cathedral of       Rouen.<br>      <br>      </span>       <table width="151" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="stanle_2.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/reviews/gr/RFFacadesImage3.jpg" width="160" height="120" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="95">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="stanle_2.html" target="_blank">Roland               Fischer&#146;s large-scale fa&ccedil;ade images resemble abstract               painting<br>              Untitled <br>              (Chicago) 2001 <br>              C-print, edition of 5 <br>              71 x 49 inches <br>              (180 x 125 cm)<br>              Digital Image Courtesy Von Lintel and Nusser Gallery, New York City</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <span class="second">Fischer&#146;s treatment of architectural form is related       to the formal language of portraiture that he developed in his Los Angeles       portrait series, 1989-91. The faces of these women float within the blue       or black frame of the customary suburban swimming pool, a monochrome color       plane with almost mathematical characteristics. Freed from any personalized       identification such as fashion, jewelry or social context, the women&#146;s       individuality recedes while more universal qualities show forth from their       unadorned flesh-toned faces. In similar ways, Fischer engages the facade       of the building -- frontally, sometimes framed against the stark blue sky       and often completely isolated from the local context of surrounding buildings.       He rarely identifies the building by name, preferring to leave the photo       untitled with only the name of the city as an index of place. What interests       Fischer least is the documentary aspect of photography. Instead, he captures       the flat planar quality of the modern office building as a purely visual       effect associated with the glass curtain wall, its imposing height and reflective       surfaces. The planarity of the fa&ccedil;ade also refers to the flatness       of the photographic image. In certain photos, Fischer goes further by cropping       to the boundaries of the building&#146;s fa&ccedil;ade so that only the       vertical and horizontal lines of the windows and structure remains framed.       The overall visual effect of this rectilinear treatment recalls the linear       enclosures of Mondrian, an artist who was both inspired by and responsive       to the architecture of the city. Fischer&#146;s photographs of the modern       office building come close to releasing the photographic subject through       the color and line of pure abstraction. He uses the digital imaging process       to transform the photographic image into a starkly abstract image, in order       to &#147;correct&#146; the waviness that results from the steep viewing       angles required to photograph tall buildings. The monotone colors and bold       lines of Fischer&#146;s digitally-edited photographs share certain visual       elements of abstract or color field painting, yet the distinctive surfaces       of photography always remains a prominent aspect of the work.<br>      <br>      Photography&#146;s move towards abstraction derives from a conceptual narrative       related to the social and cultural context of global capitalism and the       qualities inherent in digital production. New German photography exhibits       a strong fascination with surface, with rectilinear geometry, with primary       colors and shapes, with smoothness and evenness that were the central preoccupations       of modernist painting a century earlier. Fischer&#146;s architectural photos       are monumental in size, most measuring between 5 and 8 feet in length, the       size constraint related to the print limitations of the C-Print created       from a digitally-produced negative. The trend in contemporary German photography       towards larger formats is yet another direct engagement with abstract painting.       Certainly the lingering drive to legitimize photography as a fine art has       also certainly contributed to the oversized formats of the last decade.       An abstracted image invites a larger format, as it can be viewed close up       or far away and still make visual sense. It also heightens the visual impact       of color and line. Photographers first made the leap into oversized formats       during the heady art market of the 1980s, a period during which Roland Fischer       as early as 1980 and later Thomas Ruff in 1986 first used oversized formats       to show their portrait series. The effect of the larger scale on content       and image created a sensation, and became the norm thereafter for other       German photographers such as Thomas Struth, Axel Hutte and Andreas Gursky.       Fischer handles the large format in the same way used as the Dusseldorf       group, placing white margins around the entire image and laminating the       face of the print to Plexiglas. The glossiness of the photographs self-consciously       presents the branding features of corporate capitalism, a brash, superficial       style that Fischer closely associates with Americanism.<br>      <br>      </span>       <table width="323" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td class="second"><a href="stanle_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/reviews/gr/VonLintelGalleryImage4.jpg" width="320" height="124" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="47">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="sixth"><a href="stanle_2.html" target="_blank">View               of Roland Fischer&#146;s large-scale photo images of Gothic cathedrals               shown in the Von Lintel and Nusser Gallery<br>              Digital Image Courtesy of Von Lintel and Nusser Gallery, New York               City</a></span></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <span class="second">Architecture has long been the subject of photography,       originally due to the requirement of long exposure times, and later, when       picturesque views of cityscapes and the American skyscraper became the norm.       The skyscraper&#146;s soaring vertical lines, glittering steel frame and       reflective glass fa&ccedil;ade appear tailored to be pictured in a photograph.       The contemporary office tower and the rectilinear facades of corporate architecture       also provide ideal subjects for photography, a medium that is nothing but       an exact recorder of distinct volumes in space. In terms of German photography,       Bernd and Hilla Bechers&#146; documentation of industrial architecture through       a typological model provided the basis for new encounters with the city&#146;s       built form for the fresh wave of photographers emerging from the Kunstakademie       in Dusseldorf. Clearly Fischer draws upon the same imagery and architecture       of corporate capitalism that has fascinated both painters and photographers       associated with &#147;Corporate Realism.&#148; What differentiates his approach       is his willingness to bridge the stylistic distances, in this show for instance,       between the Gothic and the Modern, laying bare the roots of architectural       abstraction through the contemporary logic of the digital image. In Fischer&#146;s       hands, the smoothness and precision of the digital image ultimately call       attention to the reproducibility of architectural style through the manipulation       of images and surfaces of the modern city. </span>       <p class="second">&nbsp;       <p class="second"><font class="second"><a href="stanle_bio.html">Author's         Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>       <p class="second"><span class="second"><br>        &nbsp; </span>     </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
