The work of Letizia Battaglia, on view at Aperture&#146;s Burden Gallery   and featured in an Aperture publication from 1999 (see www.aperture.org) illustrates   how art can both respond to desperate conditions and provide an avenue of hope,   a way out of despair.<br>  <br>  Letizia Battaglia can be tagged with many labels &#150; photographer, political   activist, feminist, environmentalist &#150; none of which adequately convey   who she is. Since the 1970s Battaglia has been documenting life in her native   Sicily &#150; its tragedies and violence, its stoicism and dignity. Rarely has   an artist been bestowed with such an appropriate name: Letizia means joy, Battaglia   means battle, and these two poles define the emotional territory that her work   inhabits. While she started out as a photojournalist, Battaglia transcends the   confines of that field and imbues every image with a timeless nobility and humanity.   For several years she stopped taking pictures and officially entered the world   of politics, standing for election and serving on the city council. She was   instrumental in saving and reviving the historic center of Palermo, established   her own publishing house and is deeply involved in working for the rights of   women and, most recently, prisoners.<br>  <br>  Much of Battaglia&#146;s work documents the brutality of the Mafia: corpses,   grieving widows, bloodstained streets. What is striking is the conflict between   acceptance and outrage. Groups of onlookers, stoical and beyond shock, have   seen it all before. Mourners wracked by sobs seem to be playing out a tragedy   that defines every chapter of their lives. But Battaglia refuses to accept this   reality. Her lens moves in too close for comfort, capturing a moment that is   not meant to be seen, a scene that perhaps will be set back in order, hurriedly,   as soon as possible (Fig 1).<br>  <br>  Battaglia&#146;s proximity to her subjects is unblinkingly honest, but it is   never cruel. Her photographs of psychiatric patients expose the dimensions of   their world without condescension. Most of Battaglia&#146;s subjects either   avoid the camera or are caught unawares. Mafiosi on trial, of course, would   rather be elsewhere and look away in shame or defiance. Aristocrats at a gala   party are as oblivious to the photographer as they are to the wider surrounding   world. But there are some notable exceptions. Her portraits of children, particularly   young girls, pay tribute to their eerie, prematurely adult beauty. Interestingly,   these adolescent girls openly return the camera&#146;s gaze. It seems to be   a complicit glance, charged with a conspiratorial understanding of life&#146;s   inequity and harshness. Another powerful image in the exhibition &#150; a young   mother whose child has been bitten by a rat during the night &#150; atypically   looks straight into the camera, honestly acknowledging her plight, yet more   heroic than resigned. One of the most emotionally laden and direct glances is   exchanged between the photographer and Magistrate Roberto Scarpinato. It was   Scarpinato who was the lead prosecutor in the trial of former Prime Minister   Giulio Andreotti (who was acquitted). Scarpinato stands erect and stares ahead,   enveloped in sadness. His entourage of bodyguards looks away (Fig 2).<br>  <br>  The image used for Aperture&#146;s Burden Gallery announcement is one of Battaglia&#146;s   most formally elegant works (Fig 3). It is a portrait of Rosaria Schifani, widow   of the bodyguard for Judge Giovanni Falcone, who was assassinated with the Judge   in 1992. Schifani spoke out eloquently at the state funeral, and in Battaglia&#146;s   photograph, her face is cut vertically by a black shadow. Emerging from the   shadows, she could be a symbol of present-day Sicily, half-trapped in ancient   rituals and blood feuds, half-released into the sunlight.<br>  <br>  I spoke to Battaglia in early October, conveying a message from Melissa Harris,   Senior Editor at Aperture and curator of this exhibition. Harris wanted Battaglia   to know that she would understand if the photographer decided to forego her   trip to New York, given the difficulties of post-September 11th life in the   city, and the specific rigors of airline travel. Typically, Battaglia was indignant   and insisted that she had to come to New York, now more than ever, to show her   solidarity. Once here, the city&#146;s sadness and sense of depletion struck   her. She has seen her own city under attack, albeit one of a different nature   and duration, and she has seen her country wounded and fearful. She knows, better   than most, that courage can uncover the power to endure and to heal. </p></body></html>
