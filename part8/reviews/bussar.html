While their scale alone was arresting,               there was certainly more to these images than the concept of &quot;bigger               is better.&quot; The tremendous presence of these two groups of               pictures-Walker Evans murals at Andrea Rosen Gallery and <i>heads</i>               by Philip-Lorca diCorcia at Pace Wildenstein, Chelsea-had a big               impact, each in its own way related to scale: in Evans' case, due               to its subversion of photographic transparency; and in diCorcia's,               due to its captivating reconstruction of social vision.</p>            <p class="second"> The Evans exhibition, on view from September 4 			  through October 27, 2001, consisted of five mural-sized prints, 			  each measuring approximately six-by-eight feet. Mounted on Masonite, 			  these gelatin silver prints were among thirteen that Evans printed 			  at this scale for his 1971 retrospective at the Museum of Modern 			  Art, New York. Each large panel has been assembled from two complementary 			  halves that together form a kind of photographic diptych. Their 			  mounting in this exhibit reveals six screw holes in each panel--twelve 			  for each image--used during their installation as backdrops in 1971. 			  The bared white edges of the Masonite, scratched and marred in some 			  places, make it possible to see where the Masonite stops and the 			  photograph begins. Together, the exposed screw holes and edges suggest 			  these panels' contemporary status as artifacts of museum history. 			  The project seems as determined to collapse the boundary between 			  image and mount as it is to question the distinction between a photograph 			  and the objects it records.</p>			<p class="second"> Each image Evans selected for this project is devoid 			  of people, but human presence touches every aspect of what is photographed: 			  from the bent fork tines in an Alabama sharecropper's shack to a 			  hand-lettered shoe shine advertisement; from the outside of identical 			  houses behind a wall of movie billboards (the most prominent one 			  featuring a battered Carole Lombard) to the delicately embroidered 			  pillow on a shrimp fisherman's bed. Such unpeopled images are not 			  unusual in Evans' oeuvre, but humans' consistent absence here suggests 			  careful selection by Evans himself (or the curator, John Szarkowski). 			  But what else makes this group of pictures cohere? </p>			<p class="second">Each photograph has a strong physicality: the stained 			  and strained slats of wood to which a silverware rack is tacked; 			  the smooth walls hung with religious images; the peeling paint on 			  a dormant billboard. Each photograph depicts either wood or board, 			  virtually doubling its physicality. The wit of a photograph of a 			  billboard (however run-down) being itself turned into a billboard 			  is obvious, but perhaps more important is its ability to erase the 			  line so often drawn between art and artifact, creative masterpiece 			  and everyday object. This is not to say that Evans does not have 			  the skill of an art photographer; he does. With these photographs, 			  he has transformed would-be art photographs into something far more 			  complex: neither simply art nor mere object.</p>			<p class="second"> This accomplishment may go a long way toward explaining 			  the impact of those empty screw holes on the surface of the panels. 			  One wonders why Evans (never the art photographer envisioned by 			  Alfred Stieglitz) would have printed such magnificently large photographs 			  only to bore holes in them. But these holes are the only feature 			  disturbing the transparency of these images as photographs, a characteristic 			  of the medium we frequently overlook. As Roland Barthes wrote in 			  <i>Camera Lucida</i>: &quot;Whatever it grants to vision and whatever 			  its manner, a photograph is always invisible: it is not it that 			  we see.&quot; 1 This informs the statement, &quot;It's such-and-such,&quot; 			  as opposed to, &quot;It's a photograph of such-and-such.&quot; It 			  is perhaps an even easier slip of the tongue-and mind-to do this 			  when a photograph is large and its content may be life-sized. It 			  would be easy to do this before Evans' pictures, if not for these 			  holes. Nowhere are we so lulled into easy looking than with <i>Kitchen 			  Wall, Alabama Farmstead</i> (1936). A quick glance might register 			  these holes as a few more nails in the kitchen wall itself. The 			  physicality of these panels and the holes in them make certain that 			  we remember that these holes are not nails any more than this photograph 			  <i>is</i> a kitchen wall. </p>			<p class="second"> A different, yet equally certain, reminder is manifest 			  in Philip-Lorca diCorcia's most recent work, heads (1999-2001). 			  In these seventeen color photographs--measuring four-by-five feet--diCorcia 			  has captured some happenstance pedestrians in Times Square, with 			  the help of a radio signal, a strobe light, and some twenty feet 			  of distance. With the photographer and his camera positioned well 			  out of view, the radio signal prompted a strobe concealed in scaffolding 			  that isolated unsuspecting passersby in a lit instant. The effect 			  is remarkable: a well-lit figure or group emerges from such complete 			  blackness into the glow of the strobe that it is almost inconceivable 			  that diCorcia made these pictures at noon and not midnight. These 			  people were singled out not only by diCorcia's light, but also by 			  their membership in a group of seventeen printed from over four 			  thousand photographed. 2 Approximately life-sized, diCorcia's subjects 			  invite our inspection, a prolonged version of the unsolicited, studying 			  looks doled out every day, on every city street. These are portraits 			  of social vision itself. </p>			<p class="second"> Like other street photographs before them, DiCorcia's 			  heads afford a more leisurely consideration of the persons pictured 			  than everyday encounters can allow. According to Luc Sante, writing 			  in the accompanying catalogue, diCorcia offers up a fiction, not 			  the &quot;unvarnished, unprocessed, and unpremeditated truth&quot; 			  of Walker Evans or Harry Callahan. 3 Yet, whatever &quot;truth&quot; 			  might be gleaned from an Evans photograph of a subway rider or a 			  Callahan of Chicago pedestrians is just as fictional. This fiction 			  is of the sort we hastily compose as we walk down an avenue. Is 			  it not, after all, the freedom to do this unabashedly that constitutes 			  the irresistible lure of the street photograph? It is all the more 			  ironic that our attraction to such photographs is predicated on 			  a conviction that the camera is never pointed at us. To read a person, 			  to construct her or his identity from a variety of what we take 			  to be &quot;signifiers&quot; is to do nothing less than to draft 			  a fiction. The privileged intimacy experienced before DiCorcia's 			  <i>heads</i> indulges our urge to compose as we will. While a fair-haired 			  teenage girl or a businessman might seem to embody a certain type, 			  a certain &quot;identity,&quot; the artist himself has said, &quot;Most 			  of the time, people&#133; present themselves as clich&eacute;s of 			  what they should be.&quot; 4 Still, before these pictures, one encounters 			  oneself reflected in the interminable blackness surrounding the 			  figures. At this point comes the chilling reminder that it is our 			  type, our character that has fashioned the entire fiction. </p>			<p class="second"><a href="bussar_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a> 			</p>			<p><font class="second"><a href="bussar_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> 			  <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Katherine Bussard.
