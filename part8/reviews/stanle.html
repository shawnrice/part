Well known for his monochrome explorations             of portraiture, this show of ten large-scale photographs included             the facades of gothic cathedrals and corporate high rises, buildings             of archetypal recognition. Fischer&#146;s presentation of the gothic             with the modern is hardly spurious. The soaring, light-filled skeletal             volumes of the gothic cathedral were sources of inspiration for early             skyscraper designs by Berlin architects in the 1920s and 30s, in particular             Mies van der Rohe&#146;s expressionist glass skyscrapers. This formal             continuity is revealed through Fischer&#146;s superimposition of the             interior of the gothic cathedral with exterior views. In Fischer&#146;s             combination, the stone fa&ccedil;ade weaves into the erupting forms             of the interior space. The stone exterior dissolves into an array             of geometric forms, reenacting the great transformations in architectural             form precipitated by the construction of the Crystal Palace of 1851,             a building now seen as the earliest precursor of the glass architecture             of the modern office building. The diamond-shaped verticals of the             pointed arches appear to peel open from the dark shell of the interior,             introducing an organic quality of movement into the static iconography             of the cathedral. As the image itself is crucial for Fischer, the             superimposition of interior/exterior opens up new visual territory.             In line with Fischer&#146;s disruption of the stone fa&ccedil;ade,             Monet declared, regarding his Cathedral series, that &#147;everything             changes, even stone,&#148; to express his intentions to capture the             shifting conditions of light and vapor that surrounded the fa&ccedil;ade             of the Cathedral of Rouen.<br>            <br>            </span>            <table width="136" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="190">              <tr>                 <td><a href="stanle_2.html"><img src="gr/RFFacadesImage3.jpg" width="160" height="120" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="95">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="stanle_2.html" target="_blank">Roland                     Fischer&#146;s large-scale fa&ccedil;ade images resemble abstract                     painting<br>                    Untitled <br>                    (Chicago) 2001 <br>                    C-print, edition of 5 <br>                    71 x 49 inches <br>                    (180 x 125 cm)<br>                    Digital Image Courtesy Von Lintel and Nusser Gallery, New                     York City</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <span class="second">Fischer&#146;s treatment of architectural form             is related to the formal language of portraiture that he developed             in his Los Angeles portrait series, 1989-91. The faces of these women             float within the blue or black frame of the customary suburban swimming             pool, a monochrome color plane with almost mathematical characteristics.             Freed from any personalized identification such as fashion, jewelry             or social context, the women&#146;s individuality recedes while more             universal qualities show forth from their unadorned flesh-toned faces.             In similar ways, Fischer engages the facade of the building -- frontally,             sometimes framed against the stark blue sky and often completely isolated             from the local context of surrounding buildings. He rarely identifies             the building by name, preferring to leave the photo untitled with             only the name of the city as an index of place. What interests Fischer             least is the documentary aspect of photography. Instead, he captures             the flat planar quality of the modern office building as a purely             visual effect associated with the glass curtain wall, its imposing             height and reflective surfaces. The planarity of the fa&ccedil;ade             also refers to the flatness of the photographic image. In certain             photos, Fischer goes further by cropping to the boundaries of the             building&#146;s fa&ccedil;ade so that only the vertical and horizontal             lines of the windows and structure remains framed. The overall visual             effect of this rectilinear treatment recalls the linear enclosures             of Mondrian, an artist who was both inspired by and responsive to             the architecture of the city. Fischer&#146;s photographs of the modern             office building come close to releasing the photographic subject through             the color and line of pure abstraction. He uses the digital imaging             process to transform the photographic image into a starkly abstract             image, in order to &#147;correct&#146; the waviness that results from             the steep viewing angles required to photograph tall buildings. The             monotone colors and bold lines of Fischer&#146;s digitally-edited             photographs share certain visual elements of abstract or color field             painting, yet the distinctive surfaces of photography always remains             a prominent aspect of the work.<br>            <br>            Photography&#146;s move towards abstraction derives from a conceptual             narrative related to the social and cultural context of global capitalism             and the qualities inherent in digital production. New German photography             exhibits a strong fascination with surface, with rectilinear geometry,             with primary colors and shapes, with smoothness and evenness that             were the central preoccupations of modernist painting a century earlier.             Fischer&#146;s architectural photos are monumental in size, most measuring             between 5 and 8 feet in length, the size constraint related to the             print limitations of the C-Print created from a digitally-produced             negative. The trend in contemporary German photography towards larger             formats is yet another direct engagement with abstract painting. Certainly             the lingering drive to legitimize photography as a fine art has also             certainly contributed to the oversized formats of the last decade.             An abstracted image invites a larger format, as it can be viewed close             up or far away and still make visual sense. It also heightens the             visual impact of color and line. Photographers first made the leap             into oversized formats during the heady art market of the 1980s, a             period during which Roland Fischer as early as 1980 and later Thomas             Ruff in 1986 first used oversized formats to show their portrait series.             The effect of the larger scale on content and image created a sensation,             and became the norm thereafter for other German photographers such             as Thomas Struth, Axel Hutte and Andreas Gursky. Fischer handles the             large format in the same way used as the Dusseldorf group, placing             white margins around the entire image and laminating the face of the             print to Plexiglas. The glossiness of the photographs self-consciously             presents the branding features of corporate capitalism, a brash, superficial             style that Fischer closely associates with Americanism.<br>            <br>            </span>             <table width="285" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="164">              <tr>                 <td class="second"><a href="stanle_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/VonLintelGalleryImage4.jpg" width="320" height="124" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="47">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="sixth"><a href="stanle_2.html" target="_blank">View                     of Roland Fischer&#146;s large-scale photo images of Gothic                     cathedrals shown in the Von Lintel and Nusser Gallery<br>                    Digital Image Courtesy of Von Lintel and Nusser Gallery, New                     York City</a></span></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <span class="second">Architecture has long been the subject of photography,             originally due to the requirement of long exposure times, and later,             when picturesque views of cityscapes and the American skyscraper became             the norm. The skyscraper&#146;s soaring vertical lines, glittering             steel frame and reflective glass fa&ccedil;ade appear tailored to             be pictured in a photograph. The contemporary office tower and the             rectilinear facades of corporate architecture also provide ideal subjects             for photography, a medium that is nothing but an exact recorder of             distinct volumes in space. In terms of German photography, Bernd and             Hilla Bechers&#146; documentation of industrial architecture through             a typological model provided the basis for new encounters with the             city&#146;s built form for the fresh wave of photographers emerging             from the Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf. Clearly Fischer draws upon the             same imagery and architecture of corporate capitalism that has fascinated             both painters and photographers associated with &#147;Corporate Realism.&#148;             What differentiates his approach is his willingness to bridge the             stylistic distances, in this show for instance, between the Gothic             and the Modern, laying bare the roots of architectural abstraction             through the contemporary logic of the digital image. In Fischer&#146;s             hands, the smoothness and precision of the digital image ultimately             call attention to the reproducibility of architectural style through             the manipulation of images and surfaces of the modern city. </span>             <p class="second">&nbsp;            <p class="second"><font class="second"><a href="stanle_bio.html">Author's               Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2002 P<i>ART</i> and Sarah Stanley.
