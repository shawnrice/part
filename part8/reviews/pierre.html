Exhibition Catalogue by Pierre 			  Apraxine and Xavier Demange, with the collaboration of Fran&ccedil;ois 			  Heilbrun and Michele Falzone Del Barbar&ograve;. New Haven and London: 			  Yale University Press, in association with the Metropolitan Museum 			  of Art, 2000. ISBN 0-300-08509-5; $24.95.</p>			<p class="second"> Unfortunately, exhibitions of art by women are 			  still few and far between. During the recent winter intercession, 			  I sought out such exhibitions for my students to visit in conjunction 			  with my Women in the Fine Arts course. Luckily this spring the Metropolitan 			  is hosting the wonderful exhibition of the works of Artemisia Gentileschi 			  and those of her father, Orazio. Last year when I taught this course, 			  I sent many of my students to view the Metropolitan's <i>&quot;La 			  Divine Comtesse&quot;: Photographs of the Countess de Castiglione</i>, 			  a marvelous, although small, exhibition of approximately one-hundred 			  photographs in the museum's Howard Gilman Gallery.</p>			<p class="second">If there ever really was a face that launched a 			  thousand ships, hers was the one, at least during Second Empire 			  Paris. Born Virginia Oldoini (1837-99) to an aristocratic Florentine 			  family, she was married at the age of sixteen to Francesco Verasis, 			  Count di Castiglione (1826-1867). Their only son, Giorgio, was born 			  a year later. Upon their arrival in Paris at the end of 1855, the 			  Countess had been sent to meet with Napoleon III to promote Italian 			  unity and independence from Austria. She became notorious for her 			  affair with the Emperor, which continued until 1857. The Countess 			  was a wild, free-spirited woman who did whatever she pleased, and 			  so her marriage to the Count was doomed; the Count demanded a divorce 			  soon afterwards. Through her exquisite beauty and her relationship 			  with the Emperor, she held quite a bit of political clout at mid-century. 			  The Countess inspired numerous artists and writers, and although 			  almost every man in Paris desired her, she did not find much favor 			  with women, who were often jealous of her beauty and status. She 			  became legendary, and in 1955 Warner Brothers released the film 			  <i>La Castiglione</i>, with Yvonne de Carlo in the title role. Arguably 			  the Countess was the model for cinematic vixens from the very beginning.</p>			<p class="second">The exhibition at the Metropolitan was devoted to 			  images of the Countess spanning almost forty-five years of her life. 			  In 1856, the Countess visited the photographic studio of Mayer and 			  Pierson and met Pierre-Louis Pierson (1822-1913), who would become 			  her closest collaborator and, at the end of her life, one of her 			  few true friends. Although the Countess was the model and Pierson 			  the photographer, most of the photographs were actually taken under 			  her direction. In the exhibition, the curators were careful not 			  to diminish either person's artistic contribution, and yet certainly 			  by today's standards there is no question that the Countess was 			  truly the artist, and Pierson simply the technician. In the same 			  way that sculptors crafted an object in clay or wax and then turned 			  it over to a foundry for production in a more permanent media, the 			  Countess brought her costumes, poses, and perfectly developed sense 			  of self to Pierson's studio. Pierson seems no more the artist of 			  the photographs than does Alexis Rudier of Rodin's sculptures. The 			  collaboration of Castiglione and Pierson produced over four-hundred 			  photographs from 1856 to 1898.</p>			<p class="second">One cannot help but think of the Countess as the 			  Cindy Sherman of the nineteenth century, and the comparison to Sherman 			  and Claude Cahun has been noted in many reviews. And it should be; 			  all of the same elements are present, such as the Countess's posing 			  in the costumes inspired by contemporary operas (which seem equivalent 			  to Sherman's film stills) and role-playing (the Countess as <i>The 			  Hermit of Passy</i> and the <i>Queen of Etruria</i> remind one of 			  many of Sherman's photographs from the 1980's and 90's). Many of 			  the works were given titles by the Countess herself, and in many 			  cases she personally hand-colored the photos. On many of the works, 			  she wrote instructions for changes or elaborations on the source 			  of the pose to Pierson (and to painters using the photographs to 			  create related images). During the exhibition one might get the 			  feeling, however, that her truly avant-garde ideas were being misattributed 			  to Pierson. It must be remembered that she not only directed the 			  poses, but used the still-nascent medium of photography to produce 			  and promote images of herself in various guises, much like a contemporary 			  artist might do today. (I cannot help but recall Robert Morris' 			  untitled 1974 poster for <i>The Voice</i>, in which the artist is 			  dressed up in sadomasochistic gear.) The Countess de Castiglione 			  was the predecessor of not only Sherman, but also of Orlan, of Matthew 			  Barney, and countless other contemporary artists considered cutting-edge 			  for their more recent representations of self and beauty, and the 			  use of distortion, performance and disguise. The Countess had done 			  all of this over 150 years earlier.</p>			<p class="second">The catalogue is better at advancing the Countess's 			  personal contribution to the images. The text is beautifully illustrated 			  and includes essays by the curators, although I prefer the title 			  of the French edition <i>La comtesse de Castiglione par elle-m&ecirc;me</i> 			  (The Countess de Castiglione by Herself). The essays, although scholarly 			  in every respect, are as readable as any novel of the period. Although 			  some minor errors may exist within the text (for example the sculptor 			  Marcello may or may not have used the Countess's visage for her 			  sculpture of <i>Bianca Capello</i>, which Apraxine asserts on page 			  51 but which I could not confirm with the Fondation Marcello), overall 			  the essays within are full of enlightening information about the 			  Second Empire and its cast of characters. Do not skip over the footnotes; 			  in some cases they are as intriguing as the text.</p>			<p class="second">As in the greatest novels of the period, the heroine's 			  beauty was fleeting. Sadly, Castiglione died alone, a little mad, 			  devoted to her dog and to her illustrious past. The Countess's later 			  pictures again remind us of recent work, such as the deeply emotional 			  images by Hanna Wilke. Both artists created extraordinary final 			  works, vanitas images par excellence. Although her greatness and 			  powerful beauty were evidently lost, the Countess continued having 			  herself photographed throughout the 1890's with Pierson at the tripod. 			  Yet now she donned dower black garments, as if in mourning for her 			  own youth. She continued, to the end, marking the images with her 			  corrections and instructions for changes, adding papers to the images 			  to make herself appear slimmer, and hand-painting the photographs. 			  Rarely sold during her lifetime, the images were instead given to 			  her friends in elaborately organized albums that she organized. 			  These images were, unquestionably, her art works, regardless of 			  who actually released the shutter. The catalogue is a fitting testament 			  to one woman's quest for power through beauty, self-identity, and 			  art.</p>			<p><font class="second"><a href="pierre_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> 			  <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Caterina Pierre.
