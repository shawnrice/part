Though countless New Yorkers         witnessed the horror live, for many, the images it evokes still largely         comprise the endlessly repeated footage that the media burned into our         collective memory in the days and weeks afterward. But, like the past         work of the photojournalist cooperative <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com" target="_blank"><b>Magnum         Photo</b></a>, this extraordinary collection of photographs and personal         testimonies can shock even the most media-soaked consciousness out of         visual burnout.</p>      <p class="second">Magnum's typically far-flung members had coincidentally         convened at their New York office on September 10th to discuss the future         of documentary photography. The next day, eighteen of them made their         way through fleeing crowds to record scene after disturbing scene and         remained at the site in the days to follow, capturing the aftermath and         the city's public, visual outpouring of grief. The resulting book, New         York September 11, published by Magnum collaborator <a href="http://www.powerhousebooks.com" target="_blank"><b>powerhouse         books</b></a> is accompanied by an exhibition at the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org" target="_blank"><b>New         York Historical Society</b></a>, on view though February. A portion of         the proceeds is being donated to the New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund.</p>      <p class="second">The exhibit, one of the first museum shows about the attacks,         is the first of an approximated six exhibitions that the historical society         plans to present in the next few years as part of the museum's History         Responds project. Other recent exhibitions on the topic, such as &quot;Here         Is New York,&quot; and the &quot;September 11 Photo Project,&quot; which         counted Magnum members among its participants, focused on audience participation         and a sense of collective sharing of grief, and included amateur photographs.         One might argue that the city's mourning, made visual in murals, makeshift         memorials and photocopies, can be seen as its own crop of spontaneous         history exhibitions, an interpretation that the poignant photos of candlelight         vigils by Paul Fusco and Chien-Chi Chang seem to underscore. Other museums,         such as the Smithsonian, have expressed a desire to wait to mount an exhibition,         perhaps sharing the view that this event is still too raw to be relegated         to historical annals in a non-participatory way.</p>      <p class="second">But although truly interpretative material takes longer         to develop, requiring time and distance from the attacks, an event of         this magnitude is inevitably, immediately historicized. The exhibition         in particular attempts to let historical reality set in, freeze-framed         and silent. A subtle, steel-gray wall, imprinted with the names of the         victims, becomes imposing in the small space of the gallery, a tangible         tombstone for those who will have none. With an obvious predecessor in         the Vietnam Memorial, the wall exemplifies the psychological weight of         tragedy. Even the show's stark title, inclusive of only the bare facts         of date and location, and devoid of semantic interpretation, carries weight.</p>      <p class="second">One of the more striking, and yet familiar, works in the         exhibition is Evan Fairbanks' amateur video, which was deemed in keeping         with Magnum's documentary tradition, and included in the book as a series         of small stills. Fairbanks, a cameraman on his way to Trinity Church to         record a religious program, instead produced this horrifyingly intimate         video, which includes ground-level view of the crash by the second plane         and the collapse of the first tower. Beginning with a sea of faces marching         past the camera in the first, calmer stages of evacuation, the scene eventually         transforms into an otherworldly vision of people hurrying through an apocalyptic         snowstorm. It is the small details in the video that are the most arresting;         Fairbanks follows the path of a solitary, fleeing bird, and lingers on         an abandoned cell phone, continually probing for a signal. </p>      <p class="second">On the wall opposite the continuous loop is Steve McCurry's         photograph of a chain of firefighters dwarfed by an immense expanse of         wreckage, a ribbon of hose connecting them, an image that underscores         their heroics while implying the relative futility of their attempts.         An aerial view, perhaps taken from a building that had not yet collapsed,         this is one of many images that shocks in the obviously dangerous conditions         under which it was shot. Magnum founder Henri Cartier-Bresson stated,         &quot;Magnum was created to&#133; oblige us, to bring testimony on our         world and contemporaries according to our own abilities and interpretations&#133;         when one is nearby one must stay photographically in contact with the         realities taking place in front of our lenses and not hesitate to sacrifice         material comfort and security.&quot; His words are echoed in all these         works, notably in Larry Towell's foray downtown with only a small, fully         automatic camera, and McCurry's photographs of teetering wreckage shot         through broken windows.</p>      <p class="second">Both mounted in the exhibit and interspersed within the         full-page photographs are written narratives from the photographers themselves.         Though eloquent, their words attest mainly to a sense of disbelief and         an echoing of the sentiments of many Americans, namely that these things         do not happen at home. As Susan Meiselas put it, &quot;All of us who go         to these wild places know we can come home. It was very reassuring to         have that harbor.&quot; Her photograph of J. Seward Johnson Jr.'s hyperreal         sculpture of a man sitting with an open briefcase, left amid an empty         drift of strewn paper and debris, is an exquisitely silent image, taken         on a day in which no one had anything erudite to say. The sculpture at         Liberty Square has now taken on a new meaning, standing for those thousands         now gone.</p>      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" width="166" height="142">        <tr>           <td><a href="http://part-archive.finitude.org/reviews/gregor_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/meiseles.jpg" width="200" height="135"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="24">             <div align="center" class="sixth">&copy;Susan Meiselas, 2001, Magnum               Photos</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">The last room of the exhibit and a section of the book         entitled &quot;Farewell to the Towers&quot; includes Magnum photos taken         over the last quarter century. Understandably, the visual myth of the         standing towers has now reached drastic proportions, with postcards, posters,         and photographs selling out across the city, but none express the revered         place in collective memory they now occupy more eloquently than does Joseph         Koudelka's 1988 photo. In this image of immense proportions, covering         an entire wall, the foreshortened towers rise at angles into infinity,         before finally disappearing into mist.</p>      <p class="second"> Thomas Hoepker, who conceived of both the book and the         exhibition, addresses the human need to deal with events visually and         the heavy hand that the media plays in our perception of events. &quot;Only         when I saw the pictures did it become a reality,&quot; he states. &quot;That         is typical for our day and age, isn't it? If it's not on TV, it hasn't         happened.&quot; A Magnum member deeply committed to the tradition of documentary         photography, he reiterates that the book's sole purpose is to &quot;bear         witness.&quot; Like the past work of Magnum, the book itself is meant         to be a document of that day, the visions within as tangible and yet as         ephemeral as the singed snowdrifts of office paper depicted within.</p>      <p><font class="second"></font><br>        &nbsp;     </td>    <td width="10">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
