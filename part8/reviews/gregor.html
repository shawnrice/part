Though countless 			  New Yorkers witnessed the horror live, for many, the images it evokes 			  still largely comprise the endlessly repeated footage that the media 			  burned into our collective memory in the days and weeks afterward. 			  But, like the past work of the photojournalist cooperative <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com" target="_blank"><b>Magnum 			  Photo</b></a>, this extraordinary collection of photographs and 			  personal testimonies can shock even the most media-soaked consciousness 			  out of visual burnout.</p>			<p class="second">Magnum's typically far-flung members had coincidentally               convened at their New York office on September 10th to discuss the               future of documentary photography. The next day, eighteen of them               made their way through fleeing crowds to record scene after disturbing               scene and remained at the site in the days to follow, capturing               the aftermath and the city's public, visual outpouring of grief.               The resulting book, New York September 11, published by Magnum collaborator               <a href="http://www.powerhousebooks.com" target="_blank"><b>powerhouse               books</b></a> is accompanied by an exhibition at the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org" target="_blank"><b>New               York Historical Society</b></a>, on view though February. A portion               of the proceeds is being donated to the New York Times 9/11 Neediest               Fund.</p>			<p class="second">The exhibit, one of the first museum shows about 			  the attacks, is the first of an approximated six exhibitions that 			  the historical society plans to present in the next few years as 			  part of the museum's History Responds project. Other recent exhibitions 			  on the topic, such as &quot;Here Is New York,&quot; and the &quot;September 			  11 Photo Project,&quot; which counted Magnum members among its participants, 			  focused on audience participation and a sense of collective sharing 			  of grief, and included amateur photographs. One might argue that 			  the city's mourning, made visual in murals, makeshift memorials 			  and photocopies, can be seen as its own crop of spontaneous history 			  exhibitions, an interpretation that the poignant photos of candlelight 			  vigils by Paul Fusco and Chien-Chi Chang seem to underscore. Other 			  museums, such as the Smithsonian, have expressed a desire to wait 			  to mount an exhibition, perhaps sharing the view that this event 			  is still too raw to be relegated to historical annals in a non-participatory 			  way.</p>			<p class="second">But although truly interpretative material takes 			  longer to develop, requiring time and distance from the attacks, 			  an event of this magnitude is inevitably, immediately historicized. 			  The exhibition in particular attempts to let historical reality 			  set in, freeze-framed and silent. A subtle, steel-gray wall, imprinted 			  with the names of the victims, becomes imposing in the small space 			  of the gallery, a tangible tombstone for those who will have none. 			  With an obvious predecessor in the Vietnam Memorial, the wall exemplifies 			  the psychological weight of tragedy. Even the show's stark title, 			  inclusive of only the bare facts of date and location, and devoid 			  of semantic interpretation, carries weight.</p>			<p class="second">One of the more striking, and yet familiar, works 			  in the exhibition is Evan Fairbanks' amateur video, which was deemed 			  in keeping with Magnum's documentary tradition, and included in 			  the book as a series of small stills. Fairbanks, a cameraman on 			  his way to Trinity Church to record a religious program, instead 			  produced this horrifyingly intimate video, which includes ground-level 			  view of the crash by the second plane and the collapse of the first 			  tower. Beginning with a sea of faces marching past the camera in 			  the first, calmer stages of evacuation, the scene eventually transforms 			  into an otherworldly vision of people hurrying through an apocalyptic 			  snowstorm. It is the small details in the video that are the most 			  arresting; Fairbanks follows the path of a solitary, fleeing bird, 			  and lingers on an abandoned cell phone, continually probing for 			  a signal. </p>			<p class="second">On the wall opposite the continuous loop is Steve 			  McCurry's photograph of a chain of firefighters dwarfed by an immense 			  expanse of wreckage, a ribbon of hose connecting them, an image 			  that underscores their heroics while implying the relative futility 			  of their attempts. An aerial view, perhaps taken from a building 			  that had not yet collapsed, this is one of many images that shocks 			  in the obviously dangerous conditions under which it was shot. Magnum 			  founder Henri Cartier-Bresson stated, &quot;Magnum was created to&#133; 			  oblige us, to bring testimony on our world and contemporaries according 			  to our own abilities and interpretations&#133; when one is nearby 			  one must stay photographically in contact with the realities taking 			  place in front of our lenses and not hesitate to sacrifice material 			  comfort and security.&quot; His words are echoed in all these works, 			  notably in Larry Towell's foray downtown with only a small, fully 			  automatic camera, and McCurry's photographs of teetering wreckage 			  shot through broken windows.</p>			<p class="second">Both mounted in the exhibit and interspersed within               the full-page photographs are written narratives from the photographers               themselves. Though eloquent, their words attest mainly to a sense               of disbelief and an echoing of the sentiments of many Americans,               namely that these things do not happen at home. As Susan Meiselas               put it, &quot;All of us who go to these wild places know we can               come home. It was very reassuring to have that harbor.&quot; Her               photograph of J. Seward Johnson Jr.'s hyperreal sculpture of a man               sitting with an open briefcase, left amid an empty drift of strewn               paper and debris, is an exquisitely silent image, taken on a day               in which no one had anything erudite to say. The sculpture at Liberty               Square has now taken on a new meaning, standing for those thousands               now gone.</p>            <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" width="166" height="142">              <tr>                 <td><a href="http://part-archive.finitude.org/reviews/gregor_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/meiseles.jpg" width="200" height="135"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="24">                   <div align="center" class="sixth">&copy;Susan Meiselas, 2001,                     Magnum Photos</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The last room of the exhibit and a section of the               book entitled &quot;Farewell to the Towers&quot; includes Magnum               photos taken over the last quarter century.
