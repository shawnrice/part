(Chicago: 			  University of Chicago Press, 2001.)</p>			<p class="second"><i>on european ground</i>, a new book of photography 			  by Alan Cohen, takes three major wars of the twentieth century as 			  its theme: World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Essays by 			  Sander L. Gilman and Jonathan Bordo and an interview with Cohen 			  conducted by Roberta Smith flesh out the photographs and provide 			  a useful supplementary analysis, no doubt in part to prevent misunderstandings, 			  since any representation of the Holocaust is a sensitive topic.</p>			<p class="second">The photographs are divided into three sections, 			  which document the sites -- the literal ground - of some of this 			  century's grisliest events. The first section depicts the rolling 			  hills and former ditches of the Somme and Verdun in France, landscapes 			  representative of the slaughters of World War I. The middle section 			  consists of photographs taken at six concentration camps in Germany 			  and Poland: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Bergen-Belsen, 			  Ravensbr&uuml;ck, and Buchenwald. The last section records the pavement 			  and sidewalks where the Berlin Wall stood.</p>			<p class="second">If at first the battlegrounds of World War I, concentration 			  camps, and the Berlin Wall make a surprising juxtaposition, Gilman 			  explains the connections. According to his historical analysis, 			  the destruction of the German nation and its identity as a result 			  of World War I led to World War II, and hence to the Holocaust. 			  (Gilman hedges on this point, however, acknowledging alternative 			  theories that the Holocaust had no precedent and no comprehensible 			  reason for occurring). The Cold War and the erection of the Berlin 			  Wall followed in turn from the legacy of World War II. Gilman describes 			  &quot;the sense of many Germans, especially German Jews, that the 			  Wall, though built in 1961, somehow embodied the Nazi defilement 			  of the city.&quot; For Gilman, then, the Berlin wall was a symbol 			  of a divided country living with its criminal past, whose atrocities 			  resulted from the historical circumstances of the first World War.</p>			<p class="second">Gilman states, &quot;Cohen's project is to explore, 			  at the end of a century of mass death, how to represent historical 			  trauma in a manner true to our own moment.&quot; Through their titles 			  and subject matter, these black and white photographs reveal a depth 			  of literalness at odds with their formal, abstract appearance. The 			  actual earth, the scene of carnage and mass murder, bears few traces 			  today of its tormented history. The sites of Cohen's photographs 			  are memorials, yet they also give evidence of the erasure of memory 			  and history by nature and time. Cohen implies that our task as responsible 			  viewers is to bring back meaning to these disintegrating places 			  through our knowledge of history. The sites of past, unspeakable 			  horrors do not necessarily look evil.</p>			<p class="second">Cohen's intention in presenting these photographs 			  is not clear. If the photographs are to be &quot;true to our own 			  moment&quot; in a documentary sense, why does he use the romantic 			  format of black and white photography, which recalls either art 			  photography or old historical photos? Black and white can give a 			  &quot;timeless,&quot; solemn quality to photography; but that very 			  quality is a fiction created by our nostalgia for the format, thus 			  separating us from a sense of immediacy which Cohen claims to desire.</p>			<p class="second">The aesthetics of Cohen's photographs also raises 			  questions about their intent. As readers, we can assume his point 			  is to memorialize: we must never forget that evil, horrendous deeds 			  happened here. But why, then, are some works so beautiful? The pleasure 			  created by this beauty seems decidedly at odds with the photographs' 			  subject matter. The sensuous pictures of the hills and dells left 			  by shell craters in the Somme and Verdun suggest the earth as a 			  wounded body, which was indeed how the French viewed their nation, 			  especially after World War I.<sup>1</sup> Viewed in this context, the World 			  War I photographs are the best of the series. The beauty of the 			  photographs emphasizes how the earth itself was torn apart by the 			  war, an apt metaphor for the men who died there. </p>			<p class="second">Few of the camp photographs, to their credit, are 			  beautiful. Most are banal and boring to the point of disinterest, 			  perhaps capturing the &quot;banality of evil&quot; that philosopher 			  Hannah Arendt describes in her record of the famous Nazi trial of 			  Adolf Eichmann.<sup>2</sup> There is little contrast in tone, and the texture 			  is flat. The attention to the smallest detail, such as the corner 			  of a former building represented today by concrete curbs, hints 			  in its very normality at the agony involved in every moment of camp 			  life. </p>			<p class="second">Yet the last photograph of the section, titled <i>Bergen-Belsen</i>, 			  shows such a concrete curb covered by tiny, star-like flowers. Is 			  this frankly beautiful image a clich&eacute;d and tasteless suggestion 			  of hope in humankind? Is it a comment on the seduction and beauty 			  of evil? Or does it perhaps expose the treachery involved when we 			  trust our memory to the indifference of nature, instead of to history 			  and knowledge?</p>			<p class="second">Cohen's final photographs document the filled-in 			  gashes on the sidewalks and streets where the Berlin Wall once stood. 			  He creates pictorial abstractions of the pavement by capturing more 			  interesting views than in the camp pictures. Despite the strong 			  pictorial devices, however, these photographs are the weakest within 			  the overall schema of the book. Although grim reminders of the city's 			  (and the nation's) separation, these images finally express optimism. 			  They are signs of a city peacefully re-unified and patent symbols 			  of the end of the Cold War. </p>			<p class="second">Unlike the memorialized sites of World War I and 			  the camps, these spots have been integrated into the bustle of daily 			  life, barely noticed by anyone except tourists. This is Cohen's 			  very point in memorializing them, says Gilman. But if the Wall stood 			  for Germany and Berlin's Nazi past, as Gilman earlier states, then, 			  following his own logic, the removal of that Wall must be a removal 			  of guilt and even of memory itself. When combined with the bloody 			  devastation of World War I and the horrible circumstances of World 			  War II, such a hopeful point of view, ultimately denying the evils 			  of memory and making a case for history as progress, is highly problematic.</p>			<p class="second">In <i>on european ground</i>, Cohen reiterates the 			  importance of place in memory. Unfortunately, through his choice 			  of subject matter, which follows what could be called the coincidence 			  of history, he gives a rather pat, na&iuml;ve optimism to what should 			  be a memorial of sorrow and horror. Perhaps because Cohen, as an 			  American, is both geographically and culturally removed from this 			  complex and difficult European past, his attempt to make sense of 			  it creates a skewed narrative which simplifies the story of place 			  and memory within an unfinished history. </p>			<p class="second"><a href="moore_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a> 			</p>			<p><font class="second"><a href="moore_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> 			  <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Allison Moore.
