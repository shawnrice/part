Exhibition Catalogue by Pierre Apraxine and         Xavier Demange, with the collaboration of Fran&ccedil;ois Heilbrun and         Michele Falzone Del Barbar&ograve;.

During the recent winter intercession, I sought out         such exhibitions for my students to visit in conjunction with my Women         in the Fine Arts course. Luckily this spring the Metropolitan is hosting         the wonderful exhibition of the works of Artemisia Gentileschi and those         of her father, Orazio. Last year when I taught this course, I sent many         of my students to view the Metropolitan's <i>&quot;La Divine Comtesse&quot;:         Photographs of the Countess de Castiglione</i>, a marvelous, although         small, exhibition of approximately one-hundred photographs in the museum's         Howard Gilman Gallery.</p>      <p class="second">If there ever really was a face that launched a thousand         ships, hers was the one, at least during Second Empire Paris. Born Virginia         Oldoini (1837-99) to an aristocratic Florentine family, she was married         at the age of sixteen to Francesco Verasis, Count di Castiglione (1826-1867).         Their only son, Giorgio, was born a year later. Upon their arrival in         Paris at the end of 1855, the Countess had been sent to meet with Napoleon         III to promote Italian unity and independence from Austria. She became         notorious for her affair with the Emperor, which continued until 1857.         The Countess was a wild, free-spirited woman who did whatever she pleased,         and so her marriage to the Count was doomed; the Count demanded a divorce         soon afterwards. Through her exquisite beauty and her relationship with         the Emperor, she held quite a bit of political clout at mid-century. The         Countess inspired numerous artists and writers, and although almost every         man in Paris desired her, she did not find much favor with women, who         were often jealous of her beauty and status. She became legendary, and         in 1955 Warner Brothers released the film <i>La Castiglione</i>, with         Yvonne de Carlo in the title role. Arguably the Countess was the model         for cinematic vixens from the very beginning.</p>      <p class="second">The exhibition at the Metropolitan was devoted to images         of the Countess spanning almost forty-five years of her life. In 1856,         the Countess visited the photographic studio of Mayer and Pierson and         met Pierre-Louis Pierson (1822-1913), who would become her closest collaborator         and, at the end of her life, one of her few true friends. Although the         Countess was the model and Pierson the photographer, most of the photographs         were actually taken under her direction. In the exhibition, the curators         were careful not to diminish either person's artistic contribution, and         yet certainly by today's standards there is no question that the Countess         was truly the artist, and Pierson simply the technician. In the same way         that sculptors crafted an object in clay or wax and then turned it over         to a foundry for production in a more permanent media, the Countess brought         her costumes, poses, and perfectly developed sense of self to Pierson's         studio. Pierson seems no more the artist of the photographs than does         Alexis Rudier of Rodin's sculptures. The collaboration of Castiglione         and Pierson produced over four-hundred photographs from 1856 to 1898.</p>      <p class="second">One cannot help but think of the Countess as the Cindy         Sherman of the nineteenth century, and the comparison to Sherman and Claude         Cahun has been noted in many reviews. And it should be; all of the same         elements are present, such as the Countess's posing in the costumes inspired         by contemporary operas (which seem equivalent to Sherman's film stills)         and role-playing (the Countess as <i>The Hermit of Passy</i> and the <i>Queen         of Etruria</i> remind one of many of Sherman's photographs from the 1980's         and 90's). Many of the works were given titles by the Countess herself,         and in many cases she personally hand-colored the photos. On many of the         works, she wrote instructions for changes or elaborations on the source         of the pose to Pierson (and to painters using the photographs to create         related images). During the exhibition one might get the feeling, however,         that her truly avant-garde ideas were being misattributed to Pierson.         It must be remembered that she not only directed the poses, but used the         still-nascent medium of photography to produce and promote images of herself         in various guises, much like a contemporary artist might do today. (I         cannot help but recall Robert Morris' untitled 1974 poster for <i>The         Voice</i>, in which the artist is dressed up in sadomasochistic gear.)         The Countess de Castiglione was the predecessor of not only Sherman, but         also of Orlan, of Matthew Barney, and countless other contemporary artists         considered cutting-edge for their more recent representations of self         and beauty, and the use of distortion, performance and disguise. The Countess         had done all of this over 150 years earlier.</p>      <p class="second">The catalogue is better at advancing the Countess's personal         contribution to the images. The text is beautifully illustrated and includes         essays by the curators, although I prefer the title of the French edition         <i>La comtesse de Castiglione par elle-m&ecirc;me</i> (The Countess de         Castiglione by Herself). The essays, although scholarly in every respect,         are as readable as any novel of the period. Although some minor errors         may exist within the text (for example the sculptor Marcello may or may         not have used the Countess's visage for her sculpture of <i>Bianca Capello</i>,         which Apraxine asserts on page 51 but which I could not confirm with the         Fondation Marcello), overall the essays within are full of enlightening         information about the Second Empire and its cast of characters. Do not         skip over the footnotes; in some cases they are as intriguing as the text.</p>      <p class="second">As in the greatest novels of the period, the heroine's         beauty was fleeting. Sadly, Castiglione died alone, a little mad, devoted         to her dog and to her illustrious past. The Countess's later pictures         again remind us of recent work, such as the deeply emotional images by         Hanna Wilke. Both artists created extraordinary final works, vanitas images         par excellence. Although her greatness and powerful beauty were evidently         lost, the Countess continued having herself photographed throughout the         1890's with Pierson at the tripod. Yet now she donned dower black garments,         as if in mourning for her own youth. She continued, to the end, marking         the images with her corrections and instructions for changes, adding papers         to the images to make herself appear slimmer, and hand-painting the photographs.         Rarely sold during her lifetime, the images were instead given to her         friends in elaborately organized albums that she organized. These images         were, unquestionably, her art works, regardless of who actually released         the shutter. The catalogue is a fitting testament to one woman's quest         for power through beauty, self-identity, and art.</p>      <p><font class="second"><a href="pierre_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>         <br>        &nbsp;     </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
