When PART 8 was first conceived,             the editors envisioned a forum in which many writers would debate,             question and challenge the perceived roles of photography&#151;both             &#147;artistic&#148; and &#147;vernacular&#148; &#150;&#150;and what             was implied by such a separation. Many contemporary photographers             were making work that embraced an aesthetic of heightened artificiality             achieved through devices such as digital manipulation. This work,             characterized by monumental scale, an extraordinary amount of detail             and hyper-saturated color, to name only a few of the most visible             traits, was both praised for redefining the medium and criticized             as pure spectacle. However, what was undeniable was that the market             for these works had exploded. Museums, galleries and art journals             supported this photography through numerous exhibitions and catalogues,             resulting in previously unimaginable prices for works at the galleries             and then later at auctions, and a myriad of articles and journals             devoted the subject. Further blurring the lines between fashion and             art, between critique and spectacle, the work transcended the gallery             and museum circuit. Not only was it both featured in and its aesthetic             imitated in glossy fashion and lifestyle magazines, but several prominent             photographers were commissioned to produce work for designer boutiques.<br>            <br>            This moment appeared to be temporarily interrupted by the events of             September 11th when images of the twin towers on fire were immediately             transmitted, copied and consequently sold worldwide. Suddenly, the             same photograph seemed to be everywhere at once&#151;from the covers             of local and international newspapers and magazines (reproduced both             with and without captions) to the streets of New York City, where             the same image was downloaded from the Internet, rephotographed and             sold, matted and framed, as a morbid memento. The market for this             image appears unabated as vendors near Ground Zero continue to do             brisk business selling both photographs and gruesome books comprised             of images documenting events of that day.<br>            <br>            The concept that photography, particularly vernacular photography,             is inherently structured by death has been stated by many writers,             perhaps most eloquently and explicitly by Roland Barthes in Camera             Lucida. This connection was nakedly revealed in the hastily made photocopied             montages of snapshots clutched by grieving friends, relatives and             co-workers outside hospitals, morgues, and television vans. These             snapshots&#151;private, personal, fundamentally anonymous&#151;suddenly             appeared to blanket the city, whether taped to street lights and storefronts,             framed and displayed in impromptu shrines or transmitted in pixilated             form on news programs, the internet or public service announcements.             Structuring the paper notices was the gap between the photographic             image (where the subject, whether posing at a formal event or snapped             in a candid shot, was captured in a moment full of life) and the text             surrounding it. The multiple photos would later be edited down to             a single image, designed to convey the essence of a life, reproduced             in a grid or with a short biography in the newspaper. Occasionally,             one will come upon a photocopy that has remained&#151;by now faded,             streaked, speckled and torn&#151;and experience the uncanny shock             brought by encountering a revenant from the fall.<br>            <br>            The methodology of representing historical trauma is discussed by             Allison Moore, Tina Gregory, and Marguerite Shore. In her article             &#147;The Beauty of Evil?,&#148; Allison Moore reviews on european             ground, a book of contemporary photographs by Alan Cohen documenting             the physical sites of three major wars of the 20th Century&#151;World             Wars I and II and the Cold War. Moore discusses these places, which             range from trenches in Northern France, to Nazi concentration camps,             to the pavement and sidewalks of post-war Berlin, as both contemporary             physical sites and as locations of trauma, and analyzes their memorial             function. In addition, she reflects on the profound disconnect between             physical site and photographic representation, particularly in view             of the historical and cultural distance many readers have to these             places and events.<br>            <br>            Tina Gregory examines an exhibition and book published by Magnum Photo             documenting September 11th and the days immediately following. By             chance, several members of Magnum Photo, the cooperative founded by             photojournalists such as Henri-Cartier Bresson, met in the New York             office on September 10th, 2001 to analyze and debate issues surrounding             the future of documentary photography. The very next morning, discussions             were interrupted as these photographers took to the streets to capture             the carnage and confusion that covered downtown Manhattan. Central             to Gregory&#146;s analysis of the exhibitions and the book, are her             meditations on the ability of both amateur and professional documentary             photography to bear witness.<br>            <br>            Marguerite Shore focuses on the work of Letizia Battaglia, a contemporary             Italian photographer whose politically informed work was shown this             fall in the exhibition and publication, Passion Justice Freedom. Since             the 1970s, Battaglia has been documenting life in her native Sicily.             The majority of her work focuses on the brutality of the Mafia, visible             in her images of death, destruction and emotional terrorism. Held             barely a month after September 11th, the artist declared her desire             that her exhibition would express her solidarity with and support             of the city.<br>            <br>            Kate Bussard and Jin Han analyze the work of Walker Evans in their             articles about scale and about art&#146;s relation to social activism.             In her article &#147;Big Impact,&#148; Kate Bussard discusses the             effect of scale in photography, comparing exhibitions of large-scale             works by Walker Evans and Philip Lorca diCorcia. Billboards, wooden             slats, walls hung with religious objects are the subjects of Evans&#146;s             mural-like photographs, whose raw physicality is reinforced by the             masonite mount and the visible screws and holes that mar the photographic             surface. Whereas Evans&#146;s images are devoid of human presence,             save for utensils and debris, diCorcia&#146;s heads (1999-2001) are             life-sized photographs of pedestrians shot in Times Square. Selected             by diCorcia and illuminated by a hidden strobe light, diCorcia presents             chance encounters, frozen and made monumental, which Bussard argues             function as &#147;portraits of social vision itself.&#148;<br>            <br>            Jin Han examines the complex relationship, both artistic and personal,             that existed between Evans and Ben Shahn in his article &#147;Ben             Shahn&#146;s Two Portraits of Walker Evans: A Critique Painted.&#148;             Noting that Evans introduced Shahn to photography, Han examines how             the close relationship between the two men and their differing conceptions             about the use of the medium and its potential for social and political             activism was reflected in their work. Whereas Shahn&#146;s work, particularly             of the 1930s, was more humanist, often based on historical events,             Evans project, described as &#147;objective realism&#148; was structured             more by a seemingly detached neutrality and formal concerns. Through             complex visual analysis, Han shows how their work and ideology both             conflicted and overlapped, and ultimately, the effect that each had             on the other.<br>            <br>            Melody Davis, Caterina Pierre, Rich Turnbull and I explore the construction             of gender and its photographic representation. Issues of biography,             gender and artistic production structure Melody Davis&#146;s essay             &#147;Androgyny and the Mirror-Photographs of Florence Henri, 1927-1938.&#148;             On a formal level, Henri&#146;s use of mirrors signaled her involvement             with and attempt to make visible through photography issues that preoccupied             an avant-garde enamored with technology. Yet Davis further interprets             her mirrors as metaphors for ambiguity, for &#147;play&#148; and for             a general destabilization achieved through optical effects such as             doubling, the fracturing of surfaces and the shifting of planes. Davis             not only explores her formal advances but how these photographs ultimately             represented &#147;a woman engaged in conceptualizing androgyny, and             committed to synthesizing what to others are contradictions.&#148;<br>            <br>            Caterina Pierre reviews a recent exhibition of photographs of La Divine             Comtesse&#151;the Countess de Castiglione&#151;the legendary muse,             mistress, and amateur diplomat who thrived in Second Empire Paris.             In an extraordinary act of self-reinvention, the Countess commissioned             numerous photographs from the studio of Mayer and Pierson, the official             photography studio to the Emperor Napoleon III. Yet it is not so much             the number that is exceptional&#151;more than 400 photographs made             over 42 years&#151;but the relationship between the Countess and the             photographers. The photographs were more than collaboration between             the parties, as the Countess, the driving force behind their production,             was the subject, author and patron of the works. Although Pierre asserts             &#147;&#133;certainly by today&#146;s standards there is no question             that the Countess was truly the artist, and Pierson simply the technician,&#148;             she does not attempt to debate authorship, rather she concentrates             on the significance of the Countess engagement with self-representation,             gender construction and societal constructs through the emerging medium             of photography.<br>            <br>            Over one hundred years separate the photographs of the Countess and             the work of Luke Smalley, photographs of male high-school athletes             in various states of exercise. Rich Turnbull reviews Smalley&#146;s             recent exhibition and publication entitled &#147;Gymnasium,&#148;             the title a reference to both the athletic male body and the high             school culture of sports and fitness. Although the works are structured             by a nostalgia evoked through the clothing and the equipment photographed             and the aesthetic of the work itself, they are actually contemporary             re-enactments staged and directed by Smalley. Turnbull reads the photographs             as &#147;question(s) about fabricated identity and possibly fabricated             desire,&#148; acknowledging the connections to postmodernist photographers,             19th century portraitists and a homoerotic photographic tradition.<br>            <br>            In my article, I investigate the overlaps between the portrait photography             of Nadar and the construction and representation of gender in Second             Empire Paris. Nadar was best known for his archive of Parisian artists,             a project funded by commissions for society portraits and cartes des             visites. Despite his affiliation with the avant-garde, Nadar&#146;s             photography, I argue, reveals how dominant societal stereotypes of             gender, race and class pervaded this world. His representations of             young dancers and actresses, who as Abigail Solomon-Godeau noted,             represented &#147;the spectacle within the spectacle&#148; and his             images of wet nurses and models reveal a semiotics of class and race,             gender and labor perhaps less visible in many of his portraits of             male artists.<br>            <br>            The relationship between photography and the archive, specifically             its ability to allow for classification, order and comparison, is             explored by Lisa Jaye Young, Sarah Stanley and Fred Gross. In her             article &#147;Taking Inventory: William Henry Fox Talbot&#148; Young             approaches Talbot&#146;s photography as &#147;an inventorial photograph,&#148;             a photograph that not only acts as a recording&#151;of possessions,             of situations, of data&#151;but rather reveals itself to be a more             complex system of organization, something that &#147;turns images             into depositories of facts, recorded instances, points of view, measures             or light sources, chemical combinations, and times of day&#151;a virtual             inventory in and of itself.&#148; (Young) Acting as an archive of             both the spatial and temporal, Young compares the inventory to the             photograph, arguing for an expansion and revision of photographic             history to accommodate a project such as Talbot&#146;s, one that reflected             both the material process of its creation and nineteenth-century scientific             concerns of collection, classification and comparison.<br>            <br>            Sarah Stanley writes about the architectural photography of Roland             Fischer in her article &#147;From Gothic to Modern: the Faces/Facades             of Roland Fischer.&#148; In this series of ten works, Fischer creates             a sort of architectural archive, comparing the facades of gothic cathedrals             with contemporary office towers whose architects they inspired. Fischer             focuses on the facades of these buildings, which he isolates from             their surrounding environment in order to analyze patterns of structure             and light. Stanley interprets the properties of Fisher&#146;s photographs             such as monumental size, glossy finish, and a fascination with scale,             and his use of digital manipulation as a commentary on global capitalism.<br>            <br>            Fred Gross looks at how the artists Georges Mathieu, Jackson Pollock             and Salvador Dali were portrayed through photographic documentation,             arguing that their photographic representation was central to their             critical and public reception. Photography, Gross argues, was central             to the &#147;mythologization&#148; of the artist, a condition that             characterized post-War artistic production due in part to the rise             of popular photographic magazines. Gross examines the photographic             documentation of Mathieu at work, in particular the article &#147;Mathieu             Paints a Picture,&#148; which he interprets as connecting Mathieu&#146;s             performed work of creating a painting to the photographic representation             of the &#147;artist-penseur,&#148; the Surrealist fl&acirc;neur and             the Action Painter. However, rather than adding Mathieu to this lineage,             Gross argues, the photographs were interpreted by many as confirming             negative cultural and political stereotypes, if not being an outright             farce.<br>            <br>            In the practice section, Vanessa Rocco engages the exhibition design             of Andr&eacute;e Putnam for Behind Closed Doors: The Art of Hans Bellmer,             a retrospective that ran at the International Center of Photography.             Although neglected in the literature, Rocco argues that the exhibition             design contributed significantly to the reevaluation of Bellmer&#146;s             work as proposed by the exhibition curator, Therese Lichtenstein.             Rocco examines how the layout, construction and design of the exhibition             enabled the visitor to engage Bellmer in an expanded context&#151;beyond             misogynistic or Surrealist fantasies to include social and political             critique against the Nazi government and his relatives who supported             the regime.<br>            <br>            Many thanks are due to the contributors, the editors (especially Dan             Quiles for his work with the images) and to Emily Pugh and Paige Poling             for making this issue possible. It is appropriate that this issue             should coincide with the recent appointment of Dr. Geoffrey Batchen             to our department and we would like to extend our greatest welcome             to him.
