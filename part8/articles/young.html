Most often the owner 			  or possessor of an inventory is a merchant or storekeeper, but an 			  inventory may also be a formal list of the property of a person 			  or estate, a tally of personal traits, aptitudes and skills, or 			  an evaluation &quot;of one's life and accomplishments.&quot; <sup>1</sup> Taking 			  an inventory, in a sense, is not so very different than taking a 			  photograph in that each produces a testimony that acts as a marker 			  of objects in &quot;possession&quot; for a certain duration, whether 			  that time is a lifetime or the time of exposure. The photograph 			  as an inventory is a notion which begins with photography's own 			  beginnings in the work of William Henry Fox Talbot, for whom photography 			  itself was in part an inventorial activity. In the following discussion 			  I will focus on the idea of the &quot;inventorial photograph&quot; 			  <sup>2</sup> and its function in Talbot's work. The term &quot;inventorial 			  photograph&quot; may be understood as a photograph which records 			  not only possessions, but details and tonal 			  differentiations. In a sense it is the photograph as &quot;secretary 			  and clerk&quot; <sup>3</sup> which Charles Baudelaire, twenty years later, 			  would deem the acceptable arena for photography. However, I will 			  argue that even this diminutive function of a photograph as &quot;hand-maiden&quot; 			  is not limited to the realm of pure practicality, but serves to 			  open up the medium as a site of comparison for objects and natural 			  phenomena. It is a space to understand a photograph as a visual 			  grid of temporal-spatial dimensions, and as a testament to lived 			  experience. In other words, the inventory is not an end but a means 			  toward understanding photographic structure. My intention is not 			  to claim that all photographs mimic an inventorial function, but 			  rather to borrow from the practice and individuality of history's 			  first photographer in order to further problematize the mechanics 			  of photography; in essence, a kind of structural exercise in complicating 			  the inventory of functions and definitions which constitute Photography 			  as a medium. I will look at Talbot's inventorial photographs of 			  specialized objects such as glass and china vessels, figurines, 			  books, and hats as a case study for investigating the relationship 			  between inventory-taking and the taking of photographs.</p>			<p class="second">As Carol Armstrong has extensively discussed, Talbot's 			  experimental method of photographing was largely influenced by Sir 			  John Herschel's natural philosophy as a comparative and accumulative 			  system of learning. In his <i>Preliminary Discourse</i>, Herschel 			  delineates that &quot;the first step toward understanding is to 			  accumulate a sufficient quantity of well-ascertained facts, or recorded 			  instances, bearing on the point in question. Common sense dictates 			  this, affording us the means of examining the same subject in several 			  points of view.&quot; <sup>4</sup> With this system in place, based on the 			  collecting, recording, and comparison of data and viewpoints, Talbot 			  was inclined to approach, and indeed to inventory, photography itself 			  as an instrument for the inventorializing of data and viewpoints. 			  The structure of Photography understood as such (with the guiding 			  light of Nature) turns images into depositories of facts, recorded 			  instances, points of view, measures of light sources, chemical combinations, 			  and times of day - a virtual inventory in and of itself. Every detail 			  is both recorded in his journal (written in ink) and registered 			  on the surface of the photograph itself (written in light). But 			  what does it mean to consider photography as an inventory?; and 			  how is our understanding of photography expanded when thus considered? 			  Is it reduced again to its documentary status as record-keeper and 			  hand-maiden?; or can it be broken down into various inventorial 			  functions and thereby expanded as a unique medium?</p>			<table width="76" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="111">              <tr>                 <td height="97"><img src="gr/youngimages/library125.jpg" width="125" height="96" border="0"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig. 2: </b>A Scene in                     a Library</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Of Talbot's photograph &quot;A Scene in a Library&quot;(fig.               2) on plate VIII of his book, <i>The Pencil of Nature</i>, Armstrong               writes that this image</p>            <blockquote><p class="second">...is an inventorial photograph, and the object                 of its inventory is the author's library, the same library in                 which The Pencil of Nature itself surely would be included. Self-reflexively,                 &quot;A Scene in a Library&quot; images the world of books into                 which the photograph would be inserted, as well as the relationship                 between printed text and the photograph's capacities that would                 structure such books, and even the manner in which those books                 are put together.<sup>5</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">One might expand on this object of a photograph's 			  inventory by asking the following questions: what other aspects 			  are built into the inventorial photograph as a strategic format? 			  What is the structural capacity of Talbot's inventorial photograph 			  beyond its relation to the printed word? On multiple levels of self-reflexivity, 			  how does the inventorial photograph (in particular) engage in the 			  meaning-making and inventory-taking of its author and its viewer 			  while simultaneously defining the practice of Photography itself? 			  On this level, Professor Armstrong elaborates: &quot;...Talbot's 			  instructions ask us to read the photograph self-reflexively, as 			  an image of photography, defined as a surface full of imaged detail, 			  deriving from the action of Nature and serving as a temporal index 			  of the history of the material it records,&quot; <sup>6</sup> suggesting that 			  the self-reflexivity of Photography is both a matter of indexing 			  surface (or space) and history (or time). Continuing in this vein, 			  I will consider the intersection between the spatial (the surface) 			  and the temporal (the historical index) that exists both in an inventory 			  and in a photograph. Fragmenting the notion of an inventory into 			  (some of) its shared photographic aspects or parts - and here I 			  have chosen to concentrate on the inventorial notions of comparison, 			  display, the grid, and the record or monument of the self - we can 			  investigate how photography structurally resembles the notion of 			  inventory.</p>			<p class="second">Inventory/Photography as Site of Comparison<br>            </p>            <table width="134" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="164">              <tr>                 <td height="97"><a href="young_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/glass.jpg" width="185" height="156" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig. 3:</b> Articles of                     Glass&quot; (Plate IV in <i>The Pencil of Nature</i>)</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">An inventory is a site of comparison. It is a surface               or catalogue on and in which difference and similarity can be registered.               As a system of organizing facts and recording the existence of objects               (or people), an inventory is part of the nineteenth-century scientific               preoccupation, contemporaneous with Talbot's own projects, with               systems of taxonomy and classification in accordance with Comte's               third means toward a natural method, that of comparison. <sup>7</sup>               The one after another, one above or below the next, format employed               in many of Talbot's compositions encourages and reenforces comparison               as a method for looking at, not only the objects within the photographs,               but the photographs themselves as a body or site of comparison.               Talbot's &quot;Articles of China&quot;(Plate III in <i>The Pencil               of Nature</i>) illustrates this interest in comparison as Carol               Armstrong again points out. Talbot's caption &quot;commences by               comparing this photograph to a written inventory.&quot; <sup>8</sup>               Talbot emphasizes that the camera is mute, but fast, and has the               unique ability to depict variously &quot;strange and fantastic&quot;               <sup>9</sup> forms all-at-once. Talbot's emphasis, then, is on a               new site (the photograph) as an intersection of space in the form               of surface elaborations and time in the form of instantaneity. In               a sense, not only are shapes, functions, and sizes being compared,               but also time and space. The time and space of writing is compared               to that of photography. The space of the photograph is compared               both to the real time of its making and to the contrasted time and               space of its viewing. A pendant photograph, &quot;Articles of Glass&quot;               (Plate IV in <i>The Pencil of Nature</i>) (fig. 3)is also compared               to &quot;Articles of China&quot; as they are separated by only one               page in his book. Thus glass is compared to china in terms of how               rays of light reflect the form and line of a vessel of differing               manufacture and material. A balanced composition in each image,               encourages the eye's movement from side to side, resting on glasses               of apparently similar function, but with slightly differing details               and shapes. One unique piece in the center, a circular glass dish               with a petal-like, rimmed design holds its place as an axis around               which the eye may spin in the act of comparison, encouraging constant               movement and shifting in viewing.</p>			<p class="second">Michel Foucault famously discusses &quot;Natural               History in the Classical Age&quot; as, in essence, inventories and               sites of comparison: &quot;unencumbered spaces in which things are               juxtaposed: herbariums, collections, gardens....present themselves               one beside another, their surfaces visible, grouped according to               their common features.&quot; <sup>10</sup> Foucault continues to               emphasize this dynamic writing that: &quot;from the seventeenth               century there can no longer be any signs except in the analysis               of representations according to identities and differences.&quot;               <sup>11</sup> Photography, then, as a branch of this history of               juxtaposition, and as a practice based in scientific pursuits, makes               its debut through Talbot as a comparative medium between the photograph               and Nature, between objects, between scenes or individuals within               one image, between photographs themselves, and between the spaces               and times of production and consumption. A photograph by Niecephore               Niepce, &quot;The Table Setting&quot; (c.1827), considered by many               to be the very first photograph, is worth looking at as perhaps               an initiator (and potential example for Talbot) of Photography as               fundamentally a site of comparisons with its objects of various               shapes and sizes: spoon, knife, wine glass, bottle, pitcher, bowl,               etc., each producing a different shadow, tone, or highlight. Talbot's               &quot;Tabletop&quot; of 1840, as a similar still life subject and               arrangement of &quot;facts of light&quot; on various objects, highlights               this comparison and perhaps suggests Photography's &quot;nature&quot;               as one of comparisons.</p>			<p class="second">Inventory/Photography as Display<br>              Secondly, an inventory as a record of collecting and comparing assumes               the application of a system of difference and resemblance and as               such demands a certain dynamic of display, a dynamic which requires               both a displayer and a viewer. Talbot's example of &quot;The Milliner's               Window&quot; (not included in <i>The Pencil of Nature</i>) (fig.               1), allows the display dynamic to operate on various levels which               overlap with the territory of comparison, of the grid, and of the               testament to the self, thus also pointing to the artificiality of               the divisions I have outlined here in the breakdown of inventory               for the sake of argument.</p>			<p class="second">The title &quot;The Milliner's Window,&quot; automatically 			  evokes one of the most common scenes of display, the shopkeeper's 			  window or showcase. It is only an evocation however because of the 			  title's status as make-believe. A grouping of ladies' bonnets is 			  presumably arranged for display and eventual purchase. A many-tiered 			  scenario is played out in which the title suggests a shop window 			  where these hats are for sale, available for a price. The viewer 			  is free to peruse the shapes and styles, the textures and details. 			  She may imagine her choice and its cost. Yet we know from letters 			  and other background material on Talbot that the actual scene of 			  this photograph is that of an arrangement of bonnets out of doors 			  at Lacock Abbey, all belonging to Lady Elizabeth Feilding, Talbot's 			  mother. The title is one of fancy supplied by Lady Elizabeth, establishing 			  her, in a sense, as one of the authors of the photograph. For Talbot, 			  we might assume, the essential idea was to set up a display of objects 			  as specimens upon which light would act and where the photographic 			  result itself is also a specimen that would display the camerawork 			  of detail and simultaneous representation. &quot;The Milliner's 			  Window&quot; is thus a virtual inventory of the narratives or subjects 			  which are able to coexist within the space of a single photograph. 			  It is a make-believe display of a fictional character's shop window, 			  a mother's display of her possessions as aspects of her person (she 			  owns the bonnets), a photographer's display of the range and ability 			  of his craft as a surface inventory of details, shadows, and highlights, 			  and a son's display of his own heritage and of his mother's influence 			  and indulgence.</p>			<p class="second">Peter Wollen writes that &quot;visual display is 			  the other side of the spectacle: the side of production rather than 			  consumption or reception, the designer rather than the viewer, the 			  agent rather than the patient&quot; <sup>12</sup> However, in relation to &quot;The 			  Milliner's Window&quot;, I would argue that the visual displays 			  announced by the photograph and its title engage both sides of the 			  spectacle, both sides of the photograph, that of the two designers/producers 			  and their counterpart, the viewer/consumer. Each side of the photograph 			  engages in the production of meaning and becomes enmeshed and interwoven 			  into the subject matter of the image as display.<sup>13</sup></p>			<p class="second">In keeping with the parallel between a photograph 			  and an inventory or collection of details and objects, we might 			  look to Susan Stewart who writes that &quot;the collection...compels 			  the consciousness of the observer to enter into the consciousness 			  of the collector&quot; <sup>14</sup> I would argue that this notion mirrors 			  Photography, as the consciousness of the viewer and of the photographer 			  enter into a private, visual contract of meaning production by which 			  subjectivities are enmeshed and contested, collapsed and discerned. 			  <br>			  &quot;The Milliner's Window&quot;, then, provides an example of 			  the meshing and overlap of both subject matters and subjectivities 			  inherent in Talbot's photographs, and metonymically, in photography 			  as a medium. One hesitates, however, to introduce the subjectivity 			  of the viewer into this incestuous brew of claims already complicated 			  by the narratives of mother, son, fictions, and facts. But, of course, 			  the viewer is introduced as both the imagined (by mother and son) 			  and the actual audience or &quot;believer&quot; of the scene as 			  shop window. The viewer is therefore implicit in the playful production 			  of the photograph as both viewer and customer. The viewer incorporates 			  her own more removed subjectivity by stepping into the viewing position 			  of the author/photographer, but is free to provide her own interpretation 			  of and identification with the given scene. The viewer is compelled 			  to relate the photograph back to his or her own subjective experience. 			  An entire inventory of possible meanings, intentions, and personal 			  histories is collapsed into a single image.</p>			<p class="second">This photograph, temporally removed from its moment 			  of production, assumes a many-times-removed identity today as a 			  souvenir of Talbot's own heritage, relating both photography and 			  what it depicts tautologically back to his own person. As an index 			  or residue of a lived experience (or lived experiment, in Talbot's 			  case), Talbot's photographs act like souvenirs. Susan Stewart, in 			  her discussion of the souvenir, writes that &quot;...the memory 			  of the body is replaced by the memory of the object, a memory standing 			  outside the self and thus presenting both a surplus and a lack of 			  significance...&quot; <sup>15</sup> She continues: &quot;The presence of the 			  object [here, both the photograph and the bonnets themselves] all 			  the more radically speaks to its status as a mere substitution and 			  to its subsequent distance from the self.&quot; <sup>16</sup> Like the souvenir 			  on display, both the inventory and the photograph serve as markers 			  of memory, makers of memory, and substitutes for the display, the 			  event, the life itself, an idea to which I will subsequently return.</p>			<p class="second">Inventory/Photography as Grid</p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second">&quot;...The organization of the collection itself 				replaces time. And no doubt this is the collection's fundamental 				function: the resolving of real time into a systematic dimension.&quot; 				-Jean Baudrillard <sup>17</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">An inventory is comparable to the format of a grid. 			  The grid, as a common twentieth century format for displaying, organizing, 			  recording, and inventorying goods, images, data and details, is 			  the manifestation of recorded facts onto a two-dimensional surface. 			  It is, loosely according to Webster, a system of reference, of coordinates, 			  or a framework for the storage of information. <sup>18</sup> The photographic 			  surface itself, like a grid, <br>			  may be seen as an abstracted, flattened, quadrilateral inventory 			  of marks and punctures, and patches of shadows and highlights which 			  are compared and contrasted, displayed, categorized and recorded. 			  Talbot points toward a photograph's ability to inventory objects 			  and details by organizing his articles in a loose, grid-like format; 			  one object following the next, one object above or below another, 			  posed for comparison and contrast. At once multiplied and unified, 			  his objects are held in place in grid-like, imperfect columns and 			  rows, signifying their own display value, their artifice as positioned 			  Nature, and Photography's ability to inventory as such.</p>			<table width="172" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="125">              <tr>                 <td height="97"><a href="young_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/youngimages/talbot_open_door.jpg" width="185" height="137" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig. 4:</b> The Open Door</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The grid format, as discussed by Rosalind Krauss,               is a twentieth century invention in art, yet its basis is an impulse               stemming from eighteenth and nineteenth century systems of classification               and taxonomy. Where Krauss emphasizes that the grid in Art announces               the surface of a painting or a drawing, it seems to me also that               the nature of photography as a medium of surfaces, in tandem with               its capacity as record-keeper, likewise behaves as a grid. Krauss               explains that &quot;the grid appears in Symbolist art in the form               of windows, the material presence of their panes expressed by the               geometrical interventions of the window's mullions.&quot; <sup>19</sup>               Talbot, in suggesting the fictional window in &quot;The Milliner's               Window,&quot; does not need to supply the gridded panes of glass,               they are implied by the captioned title as an organizing principle               and reference to both format and subject. The idea of the window               thus stands in for photography itself as a format for displaying               and organizing objects, as a framing device, as something with both               surface and depth, and as an instrument of reflection. In &quot;The               Milliner's Window&quot;, the idea of window (for as we have seen,               there is not an actual window here, but only a fictional one) stands               in as the photographic framework, whose perimeters become the frame               itself and whose imagined glass doubles as the lens of the camera.               The imagined window provides the gridded framework for both the               subject(s) of the photograph, and self-reflexively, for photography               as a medium. In fact, the metaphor of the window can be seen as               an underlying motif or framework throughout Talbot's entire career.               One recognizes Talbot's references to the photo-apparatus as window               in examples such as &quot;The Open Door.&quot; (fig. 4) The open               door, the background interior window, its reflections of light on               the ground, and the centered, window-like framed cut of the photograph               itself constantly refer the viewer back to the camera's aperture               and again to the human eye as both window onto the world and into               the soul. The window motif is picked up again and again in Talbot's               &quot;View of the Boulevards at Paris,&quot; his various views of               Lacock Abbey, and in a work which Buckland calls the earliest negative               in existence, &quot;The Latticed Window,&quot; taken by Talbot with               the camera obscura in 1835. By depicting and emphasizing in a letter               of the time the camera's ability to re-produce the many square panes               of a window and the whole window at once, Talbot stresses his interest               in the part-to-whole condition of both Nature and a photograph as               represented by a gridded windowpane:</p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second">No matter whether a subject be large or small, 				simple or complicated; whether the flower-branch which you wish 				to copy contains one blossom, or one-thousand; you set the instrument 				in action, the allotted time elapses and you find the picture 				finished, in every part, and in every minute particular. <sup>20</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">Talbot compares the camera's ability to a natural 			  wonder, continuing:</p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second">There is something in this rapidity and perfection 				of execution, which is very wonderful. But after all what is Nature 				but one great field of wonders past our comprehension! Those, 				indeed, which are of everyday occurrence, do not habitually strike 				us, on account of their familiarity, but they are not the less 				one that account essential portions of the same wonderful Whole.&quot;<sup>21</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">Krauss writes: </p>			<blockquote>			  <p class="second">As a transparent vehicle, the window is that which 				admits light - or spirit - into the initial darkness of the room. 				But if glass transmits, it also reflects. And so the window is 				experienced [by the Symbolist] as a mirror as well - something 				that freezes and locks the self into the space of its own reduplicated 				being.<sup>22</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">A parallel with photography is suggested.<sup>23</sup> Photographs, 			  like frozen blocks of life, lock the self as photographer and the 			  self as viewer into a visual continuum, privileging the fragment 			  or cut from reality as both transmitter and reflector of subjectivity.</p>			<p class="second">Even though I am not suggesting that every photograph 			  may be read in terms of the grid in either Talbot's work or any 			  other photographer's, the framed quadrilateral cut that photography 			  makes, its abstraction from and indexing of its referent, its serial 			  propensity, and Talbot's continuous reference to the window structure, 			  make this comparison compelling. The photograph, acknowledges its 			  surface and its literal frame of reference, yet compels the viewer 			  beyond its scope, just as &quot;the grid operates from the work 			  of art outward, compelling our acknowledgement of a world beyond 			  the frame.&quot; <sup>24</sup> Each catalogues, inventories and acts as an 			  index for its referent, substituting for the once-there objects.</p>			<p class="second">Inventory/Photography as Testament to the Self<br>			  I have addressed individual photographs (within Talbot's work) as 			  collections, as flattened, organized objects, details, and marks, 			  but what of his collection, &quot;body&quot;, or inventory of photographs 			  as a whole? Do they &quot;add up&quot; and if so, what do they attest 			  to beyond their nature as a &quot;first&quot; in the history of 			  photography? At the (or rather one) crux of Talbot's experiments 			  in photography is the desire for preservation; the preservation 			  of not only histories and collections, views and structures, but 			  also of the Self. At the onset of his diaristic notes of his experiments 			  he writes: &quot;The most transitory of things, a shadow, the emblem 			  of all that is fleeting and momentary, may be fettered by the spells 			  of our 'natural magic' and may be fixed forever in the position 			  which it seemed only destined for a single instant to occupy.&quot; 			  <sup>25</sup> Talbot's own life, as a fleeting and transitory shadow, is fixed 			  onto the pages of <i>The Pencil of Nature</i> even if its captions 			  or text do not disclose his project autobiographically as such.</p>			<p class="second">Talbot had a strong sense of self and of destiny. 			  From a very young age, at the age of eight, he instructed his stepfather 			  not to allow his mother or anyone else to throw away his correspondence 			  with them. If we look to Baudrillard's above quote and consider 			  Talbot also as collector of objects and images in addition to being 			  a producer, how do Talbot's photographs materialize as markers of 			  real time and private dimension? Talbot's original ideation of photography 			  sheds light on his notion of Photography as a solution for durability, 			  the kind of durability which outlives a human life. His original 			  desire was to achieve a fixed image, a fixed record of an object 			  on paper, more durable than &quot;a mere souvenir.&quot; <sup>26</sup> Along 			  these lines, Jean Baudrillard discusses the durability of a collection: 			  &quot;the object is the thing with which we construct our mourning: 			  the object represents our own death...&quot; He continues....&quot;a 			  person who collects is dead, but he literally survives himself through 			  his collection, which (even while he lives) duplicates him infinitely, 			  beyond death, by integrating death itself into the series, into 			  the cycle.&quot; <sup>27</sup> In this sense the collection, or the inventory, 			  and photography as an act of image collecting and preserving, all 			  perform the task of monumentalizing or marking the that-has-been 			  which Roland Barthes discusses as unique to the photograph. In Talbot's 			  case, his choice of subjects to demonstrate and memorialize photography 			  simultaneously delineate and memorialize his own existence.</p>			<p class="second">Talbot's photographs (perhaps especially his inventorial 			  photographs), and his overall project of inventorying the medium, 			  participate in the recording of the various aspects of his own, 			  private and public self. Talbot does not directly allude to this 			  reading of his photographs, however each scene in <i>The Pencil 			  of Nature</i> points in some fashion back to the person, Henry F. 			  Talbot. The Oxford College scenes reference a highly educated man; 			  various scenes and views used to elucidate photography's potential 			  functions are taken at his ancestral home, Lacock Abbey; the inventory 			  photographs reference his own collections; examples of ancient writing 			  point to Talbot as a scholar of etymology and philology; and plant 			  leaves index his role as an amateur botanist. From this angle, the 			  book becomes a not-so-veiled self-reflexive monument, not only to 			  photography, but to a man's life, the importance of his heritage, 			  and his history, not to mention his making of photographic history. 			  He could have arbitrarily chosen impersonal subject matter to accomplish 			  his demonstrations of the potentialities of photography and photographic 			  illustration, but he chose instead to depict markers of his own 			  existence, thus formulating an alternative, autobiographical subject 			  for his publication.</p>			<p class="second">In regard to the &quot;Articles of China,&quot; 			  we are told by its caption that these are specimens (already a textual 			  act of genericizing or de-personalizing by way of scientific terminology) 			  or examples of how photography might record &quot;the whole cabinet 			  of a Virtuoso and collector of old china...on paper in little more 			  time than it would take him to make a written inventory describing 			  it in the usual way.&quot; <sup>28</sup> Yet, as we know Talbot to be a gentleman 			  collector and antiquarian, the details and shapes unique to each 			  of these teapots, teacups, the lattice basket, the urns, the figurines, 			  and especially the two china figures in repose on their tiny chaises 			  (see the photograph of &quot;Lady Elizabeth Fielding on her chaise 			  lounge&quot; of 20 April 1842 as a comparison), point us back to 			  their owner and to the nature of these objects as choices, tokens 			  of travel abroad, or gifts, each with its own specific and unique 			  physical history (or what Walter Benjamin would call, &quot;testimony&quot;) 			  in relation to the photographer. Each object, like the larger photographic 			  inventory in which it participates, is a marker of memory, the author's 			  memory: this pitcher was perhaps a Christmas gift from mother, that 			  bowl was a wedding present from Kit, this urn marks my first trip 			  to Tuscany, etc. Each object in its own right and the collection 			  as a whole perform as an index to the aura of each piece's physical 			  objecthood and the collective aura, or sum total, of its possessor's 			  once-lived life.</p>			<p class="second">In addition, by concluding <i>The Pencil of Nature</i> 			  with a reference to the values of portrait photography (&quot;What 			  would not be the value to our English Nobility of such a record 			  of their ancestors who lived a century ago?&quot;), <sup>29</sup> Talbot underlines 			  his book as a &quot;noble&quot; self-portrait within and alongside 			  its more scientific and experimental functions. As heirlooms, articles 			  of glass and china, statuettes, and hats, etc. function, like a 			  photograph, as objects through which to pass on important information 			  about family events, heritage, and occasions. Although not made 			  explicit by Talbot until the end with his suggestion of the photograph's 			  value for future generations to see their ancestors, the conjunction 			  between such objects of inventory and the inventory kept by photographs, 			  seems of vital importance to his project. It is almost as if the 			  trace of memory (in the form of preservation, evidence, written 			  description, inventory of precious objects, and recorded details) 			  underlines Talbot's entire project. It is the need to make a durable 			  imprint, to fix something so that it may be remembered and seen 			  that is photography's both possible and impossible task.</p>			<p class="second">Talbot fuses his own identity with that of photography, 			  thereby proving the priority of his discovery in relation to Daguerre 			  and also demonstrating (even if un-self-consciously) a new type 			  of subjectivity unique to photography, that is, a subjectivity not 			  only bound to the authoring of an image, as in painting, but one 			  which collapses the subjectivity of author and reader, and collapses 			  at times the author and the objects he photographs. Photography, 			  from its Talbotian inception, then, is not only a natural recorder 			  of scientific objectivity and authenticity, recording the traces, 			  and markings of Time, of wear, of ownership, etc. but also a record 			  of subjectivity and artifice, of the hand that set the stage or 			  the eye that chose a scene or a view over and above all others.</p>			<p class="second">My essay concludes with the following questions 			  which remain unresolved and speak to the, as yet and perhaps permanently, 			  unresolved nature of my own understanding of the medium: How is 			  one to remain true to Talbot's photography as a project of scientific 			  experimentation, demonstration, elucidation of specimens, chemical 			  actions, shadows, and light and also act as a reader, reading Talbot's 			  subjective position into the images and simultaneously one's own 			  position of subjectivity as viewer into the work? In other words, 			  how does photography suspend and support such different, yet parallel, 			  activities?; and if <i>The Pencil of Nature</i> attaches &quot;photography 			  to the spectator over and above the operator,&quot; <sup>30</sup> then is it 			  possible to re-attach the operator in Talbot's case?; and if so, 			  how does this complicate or compromise a photograph's meaning? Of 			  what does photography's simultaneity consist?; and is this layering 			  effect of subjects, narratives, and frameworks, at once multiple 			  and unified, a quality unique to photography?<br>			</p>			<p class="second"><a href="young_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a> </p>			<p><font class="second"><a href="young_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> 			  <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Lisa Jaye Young.
