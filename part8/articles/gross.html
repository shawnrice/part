This huge canvas was meant to re-enact in paint 			  the drama of a thirteenth-century battle in which Mathieu de Montmorency, 			  one of Mathieu's ancestors, had played a decisive part. An article 			  entitled &quot;Mathieu paints a picture&quot; by Michel Tapi&eacute; 			  appeared in <i>ARTnews</i> in early February 1955, illustrated with 			  still photographs from Descharnes's film. This article, in which 			  Tapi&eacute; proselytizes for Mathieu, drew swift and negative criticism 			  from American Abstract Expressionists. In an ARTnews &quot;Letter 			  to the Editor&quot; of Feb. 22, 1955, Barnett Newman asks sarcastically, 			  &quot;are there any readers of <i>ARTnews</i> who wish to join me 			  in sending a pair of sterling silver roller skates, suitably engraved, 			  to Georges Mathieu so that he may redo his I WAS THERE dance routine 			  of the <i>Battle of Bouvines</i> into a big Blitzkrieg production?&quot; 			  Newman goes on to castigate Mathieu for orchestrating a historical 			  farce in paint, which he calls a &quot;burlesque of immediacy.&quot; 			  To Newman, Mathieu's painting was &quot;clumsy and provincial work&quot; 			  that was nonetheless sure to &quot;have the Rockefellers, the Burdens, 			  the Harry Guggenheims, and the Jock Whitneys on their knees in admiration.&quot; 			  The critical ire of Newman and other American painters like Clyfford 			  Still served to stigmatize Mathieu's painting as shallow and self-promotional, 			  and his artistic persona as silly, theatrical, and foppishly aristocratic. 			  Such a polemic served to turn public opinion against Mathieu in 			  the United States which, following World War II, was largely committed 			  to asserting the cultural hegemony of Abstract Expressionism.<sup>1</sup> Subsequent 			  art-historical analysis of Mathieu largely centers on Mathieu's 			  paintings; I want to examine how he was photographed.</p>			<p class="second">This essay will attempt to reconstruct the art production 			  of Georges Mathieu in the early to mid-1950s according to the influences 			  of the public identities of Jackson Pollock and Salvador Dali. These 			  two sources, and their appearance in popular magazines such a s 			  Life, made an impression on Mathieu, who in turn had an impact upon 			  emerging performance art in Europe. The photographic conditions 			  of Pollock and Dali's artistic personae, and their mythologization 			  (in the Barthesian sense of myth) by the mass media, involves a 			  shift in the representation of artists in photographs following 			  World War II, and in the manifestation through photographs of the 			  &quot;personality of the artist&quot; as both actor and mythmaker. 			</p>			<p class="second">The first part of this essay will sketch the representation 			  of artists in photographs since the turn of the century through 			  a close reading of relevant examples. A discussion of the construction 			  of Pollock's photographic persona by Hans Namuth will follow, involving 			  diverse sources such as Native American rituals, psychoanalysis, 			  phenomenological thinking, and photographs of Picasso that aided 			  in the personification of the &quot;action painter&quot; Pollock 			  through photographs. Salvador Dali's appearances in <i>Life</i>, 			  which involved issues of public promotion, performance, and display, 			  also had an influence upon Mathieu. The impact of Dali's and Pollock's 			  photographic promotion upon Mathieu constituted an important historical 			  shift involving the representation of artists in photographs, and 			  heralded a fundamental change in the way artists considered their 			  own production and its documentation and promotion through photographs. 			  Such a change signaled a move toward a consideration of the art 			  object as a phenomenological record of movement rather than an a 			  priori form with an interior &quot;essence.&quot; The indexical 			  quality of photography became a vital component in the production 			  of the artist's persona by capturing the physical trace of the artist, 			  arresting his movement.<sup>2</sup> Not only does Mathieu's production provide 			  a link from the &quot;action painting&quot; of Pollock and the self-promotial 			  bravado of Dali, it incorporates issues of politics and national 			  identity as well. Michel Tapi&eacute; proselytized for Mathieu much 			  in the same way as Clement Greenberg did for Pollock, involving 			  issues of politics and a nationalist identification with a mythic 			  hero.</p>			<p class="second">A discussion of Dali, Pollock, and Mathieu must 			  deal with the central role of photography and the dissemination 			  of photographic images that captured the performativity of artistic 			  production, and its circulation into mass culture in the personae 			  of the artist-as-mythmaker. Most often the photographs took the 			  form of the documentary photograph at the level of reception. Public 			  consumption of documentary photography was at a new level of cultural 			  centrality brought about by popular &quot;photo-story&quot; magazines, 			  with <i>Life</i> leading the way; in many ways, <i>Life</i> represented 			  the niche television would later fill during the Viet Nam War. <i>Life's</i> 			  documentary photographs were the primary vehicle for public consumption 			  of images of the war, and contained an inherent analogical truth-value 			  that was manipulated by American wartime propaganda. The subject 			  matter of documentary photographs and their captions were orchestrated 			  by the photographers to constitute a particular theme, subject to 			  the magazine's and the government's approval, but the public was 			  not made aware of such artifice. Thus a certain amount of deception 			  was involved, playing upon the belief of the public in the truth-value 			  of the documentary photograph. </p>			<p class="second">&nbsp; </p>            <table width="223" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="171">              <tr>                 <td><a href="gross_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/grossimages/steichen.jpg" width="222" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="gross_2.html">Fig.                     2 Edward Steichen, August Rodin, 1901</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">To understand how Mathieu's artwork is influenced               by the photographs of Pollock and Dali, we must first trace how               artists had been represented in photographs earlier in the century.               Analyzing such a lineage will establish certain tendencies which               influenced the decisions of the photographers of Dali and Pollock,               and the way in which these photographs may be read. Edward Steichen's               1901 photograph of Rodin (figure 2) is an exemplar of how artists               were depicted in the first decades of the 20th century, and set               the<br>              unofficial standard for subsequent photographs of artists. Steichen               captures the French sculptor in a moment of cogito ergo sum: Rodin               is presented in his studio as the artist/philosopher, &quot;le penseur,&quot;               who cogitates before he creates. The awareness of sculpture as an               a priori form is inherent in Rodin's decision-making; such form               need only be liberated from the mass of stone or breathed life from               out of the vaporous void which constitutes the space of the studio--a               space of quasi-divine creation given a physical corollary by the               analogical nature of the photograph. The vapor in Steichen's photograph               of Rodin's studio may be said to represent the physical manifestation               of Rodin's artistic genius, given physical substance by light, which               draws a link between Rodin's thought, the studio space, and the               sculpture he has created. </p>			<p class="second">Alexander Liberman was inspired by Steichen's photograph               of Rodin, and contributed to what was a growing genre of &quot;artist               photographs.&quot; Lieberman photographed Matisse, Picasso, Braque,               and Giacometti, among others. Many of Lieberman's photographs were               published in <i>Vogue</i> and <i>ARTnews</i> in the late 1940s and               50s together with accompanying essays on the artists and their work.<sup>3</sup>               The photograph of Giacometti entitled <i>Concentration (Alberto               Giacometti in his Studio)</i> of c. 1951 continues in the tradition               of Steichen's Rodin in capturing the artist as the isolated male               genius. Liberman's photograph may be said to embody the visual equivalent               of Jean-Paul Sartre's characterization of Giacometti in &quot;The               Search for the Absolute,&quot; written in 1948. Sartre considered               Giacometti to be a sculptor who worked &quot;outside of history.&quot;</p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second">What must be understood is that these figures, 				who are wholly and all at once what they are, do not permit one 				to study them. As soon as I see them, they spring into my visual 				field as an idea before my mind; the idea alone is at one stroke 				all that it is... the original movement of creation, that movement 				without duration, without parts, and so well imaged by these long, 				gracile limbs, traverses their Greco-like bodies, and raises them 				toward heaven. I recognize in them, more clearly in an athlete 				of Praxiteles, the figure of man, the real beginning and absolute 				source of gesture [my italics]. Giacometti has been able to give 				this matter the only truly human unity: the unity of the Act.<sup>4</sup> 			  </p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">For Sartre, Giacometti's sculpture embodied the 			  existentialist, transcendental, unitary gesture. Giacometti's &quot;gesture,&quot; 			  his additive process, signifies for Sartre the appearance of a phenomenological 			  activity of movement without duration&quot; which creates the &quot;idea&quot; 			  of man in sculpture. Sartre considers Giacometti's work to be equivalent 			  to the signification of man in art for the first time, much like 			  the lines which compose stick figures of cave paintings. The index, 			  the physical trace of the artist's hand, is a vehicle for the revelation 			  of the &quot;language&quot; of art which cannot be known a priori, 			  only experienced in a phenomenological sense.</p>			<p class="second">Giacometti, like Steichen's Rodin, sits in shadowy 			  profile, his head in his left hand, in a moment of what appears 			  to be intense concentration. We notice his sculptures and studio 			  objects readily enough, but what really holds our attention are 			  the scrawlings and scratches on the wall behind him. These indexical 			  marks serve as a physical corollary to the unitary gesture Sartre 			  speaks of, and provide a visual analogy to Sartre's studio as a 			  &quot;cave&quot; where &quot;primitive&quot; scrawlings adorn the 			  walls.<sup>5</sup> Liberman's photograph of Giacometti does not create an ethereal, 			  mystic atmosphere like Steichen's photograph of Rodin. Conversely, 			  physical traces of Giacometti's &quot;existential anguish&quot; 			  within the clearly articulated space of the studio are focused upon.<sup>6</sup> 			  But the conception of the artist as an isolated genius remained 			  the same, and would affect how the Abstract Expressionists were 			  photographed.</p>			<table width="152" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td height="199"><a href="gross_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/picasso2.jpg" width="200" height="212" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="gross_3.html" target="_blank">Fig.                     3 Gjon Mili, Picasso's<br>                    Space Drawing</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The collaboration between Namuth and Pollock has               its roots in Namuth's knowledge of earlier projects involving Picasso.               Namuth knew about Paul Haesaert's film &quot;Visite &aacute; Picasso,&quot;               shot in 1949 and released in spring 1950, in which Picasso paints               on a vertical pane of glass, behind which the camera recorded the               master in action.<sup>7</sup> Pollock would probably not have seen illustrations               from Haesaert's film, but he certainly would have seen the next               best thing: Picasso's <i>Space Drawings</i> photographed by Gjon               Mili and not<br>              only widely published in 1950 but exhibited as well at The Museum               of Modern Art. (figure 3).<sup>8</sup> Mili's photograph of Picasso captures               him drawing in space with a flashlight what appears to be a bull               or a minotaur. The long exposure arrests Picasso's motions as one               continuous, flowing line of light. The vertical, two-dimensional               plane of the photograph, then, becomes the plane of the canvas.               Picasso wears nothing but shorts and sandals, and has finished his               gesticulations with the flashlight in a balanced, athletic crouch               that emphasizes his physical agility. The light drawing, arrested               for our eye by the long exposure, only exists by the intersection               of photography, just as the gait of a running horse was proven by               Muybridge to have all four hooves off of the ground simultaneously--information               about movement unavailable to the naked eye. Movement through space               and the duration of this movement are arrested and coded by the               photograph. The phenomenological articulation of Picasso's movements               become the sum of their parts; for Namuth's photographs of Pollock,               this meant that the creation of art rests upon the articulation               of that movement within the space of the studio frozen by the camera               and reproduced in popular magazines like film stills. </p>			<p class="second"><br>            </p>            <table width="175" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="gross_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/grossimages/poll3.jpg" width="205" height="210" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="gross_4.html" target="_blank">Fig.                     4 Hans Namuth, Pollock in his studio, 1950</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Namuth's photographs of Jackson Pollock (figure               4) were taken in the summer and early fall of 1950 in Pollock's               studio with the intention of mythologizing the already-infamous               painter. Pollock had first appeared in a magazine in December 1947               when <i>Time</i> reported the opinion of Clement Greenberg, critic               for <i>The Nation</i>, that Pollock was one of the three best American               artists.<sup>9</sup> Pollock appeared in <i>Vogue</i> in 1948, and twice in               <i>Life</i>. In 1949, <i>Life</i> asked its readers, &quot;Jackson               Pollock: Is he the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?&quot;<sup>10</sup>              The photographs and text seemed to indicate that the answer was               &quot;yes.&quot;<sup>11</sup> During this period, Namuth made over 500 photographs,               a black and white movie, and a color movie (with Paul Falkenberg),               all of Pollock at work. These photographs and films are pivotal               to reckoning Pollock as a mythical figure.<sup>12</sup> Namuth's photographs               of Pollock moving around the canvas on the floor of his studio served               to confirm the persona of Pollock, which had been developed by numerous               articles and photographs appearing in the mass media.<sup>13</sup> Pollock               sought non-traditional artistic sources such as Native American               shamans to engage the space &quot;between the easel and the mural,&quot;<sup>14</sup>               but still was acutely aware of his position within the larger development               of avant-garde painting, which had been abstracted into model form               by Alfred Barr in 1936.<sup>15</sup> In 1947, Pollock stated that &quot;I believe               the time is not yet ripe for a full transition from easel to mural.               The pictures I contemplate painting would constitute a halfway state,               an attempt to point out the direction of the future, without arriving               there completely.&quot;<sup>16</sup> Due to the influx of influential European               surrealists before or during the war, American artists like Pollock               were forced to reconsider their approaches to art production. Disenchantment               with political strife in Europe and a rejection of what was considered               &quot;decadent&quot; classical aesthetic sources led both the Surrealists               and American artists to search for non-western sources for their               inspiration. The Surrealists's belief in the use of dreams, metamorphosis,               and myth as subject matter for art radically altered the American               artists's perception of what their own role as an artist should               be. Barnett Newman looked at the art of Oceania and the pre-Columbian               Americas, Pollock at Native American sand painting and shamanic               ritual dance. Adolph Gottlieb examined prehistoric petroglyphs,               and Mark Tobey was deeply influenced by Bahai and Zen. Such sources               were romanticized by American artists to a degree; however, the               tropes of such non-Western sources were not utilized to draw attention               to these cultures, but to engage their &quot;primitive power&quot;               as a means of circumventing the outmoded stylistic conventions of               European art. </p>			<p class="second">Through the Surrealists, Pollock developed an acute 			  interest in psychoanalysis. In 1939, Pollock began four years of 			  psychotherapy that would aid him in an identification with the growing 			  interest in the themes of Jungian thought. Pollock identified with 			  Jung's notion of a &quot;collective unconscious&quot; that all human 			  beings share at a level of archetypal recognition.<sup>17</sup> Jung's postulation 			  of a &quot;phenomenology of the self&quot; fused tenets of psychoanalysis 			  and phenomenology into a construction of the &quot;self&quot; (analogous 			  the to the Freudian ego) whose unconscious was regulated by internal 			  and external stimuli, creating a &quot;field&quot; of experience 			  and a response to stimuli of which the conscious ego is but one 			  part.<sup>18</sup> The other part is an &quot;extra-conscious&quot; psyche 			  whose &quot;contents are impersonal and collective...form[ing]...an 			  omnipresent, unchanging, and everywhere identical quality or substrate 			  of the psyche per se.&quot;<sup>19</sup> For Pollock, Jung's thought seemed 			  homologous with the mythic subject matter of American Indian ritual, 			  which involved a process of engaging the tangible world to express 			  the universal or mythological. Such a process for Pollock involved 			  a fundamental reorientation of the role of the artist from that 			  of the thinker to that of the &quot;act-or.&quot;</p>			<p class="second">Harold Rosenberg, for example, described this meaning 			  as the transcription of an artist's inner emotions by means of a 			  pictorial or sculptural &quot;act.&quot; &quot;A painting that is 			  an act,&quot; Rosenberg wrote, &quot;is inseparable from the biography 			  of the artist. The painting itself is a moment in the inadulterated 			  mixture of his life.&quot;<sup>20</sup> Or, again, &quot;Art...comes back into 			  painting by way of psychology. As Wallace Stevens says of poetry, 			  it is a process of the personality of the poet.&quot;<sup>21</sup> Rosalind 			  Krauss mentions that </p>			<blockquote>			  <p class="second">In speaking this way, Rosenberg is equating the 				painting itself with the physical body of the artist who made 				it. Just as the artist is made up of a physiognomic exterior and 				an inner psychological space, the painting consists of a material 				surface and an interior which opens illusionistically behind that 				surface. This analogy between the psychological interior of the 				artist and the illusionistic interior of the picture makes it 				possible to see the pictorial object as a metaphor for human emotions 				that well up from the depths of those two parallel inner spaces.<sup>22</sup> 			  </p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">For Rosenberg, the picture surface as a locus of 			  gestural marks demanded that one look at it as a map on to which 			  one could read the complexity of the artist's psychological condition--a 			  physical transcription of the artist's inner self.<sup>23</sup> Rosenberg's 			  seminal article re-affirmed Steichen's encoding of the image of 			  the artist as an isolated genius, but not as &quot;le penseur,&quot; 			  the inert and bearded demiurge. Rosenberg's &quot;action painter&quot; 			  moved through his work and through the world, linking the body of 			  the painter and his genius with the artwork itself. Thus the &quot;inner 			  life&quot; of the painting is a physical register of the phenomenal 			  experience of the painter, and a tangible articulation of his psychological, 			  existential necessity. </p>			<p class="second">Mathieu's work of the early 1950s may be said to 			  literalize Rosenberg's &quot;Action Painters&quot; mantra. Realizing 			  the importance of Namuth's photographs, Mathieu was the first artist 			  to stage live action painting as the subject of photography, and 			  as a performance before a viewing public. On January 19, 1952, he 			  had his picture taken in his own studio while painting <i>Hommage 			  au Marichal de Turenne</i>, a canvas that he consigned to his &quot;Zen&quot; 			  period, and one loosely in the style of the German gestural painter 			  Hans Hartung, whose work he respected. The conceptualization of 			  painting a picture for the camera clearly emerged from Mathieu's 			  deep admiration for Pollock, whom he considered the greatest living 			  painter. Through the example of Pollock, Mathieu realized the potential 			  connection between painting, photography, performance, and the public.<sup>24</sup>			  The documentary nature of the photograph, given world attention 			  by magazines like <i>Life</i>, carried the content of painting and 			  the process of performance to the public. Mathieu was the first 			  to synthesize this connection.<sup>25</sup></p>			<p class="second">But Mathieu's <i>Battle of the Bouvines</i>(figure               1) cannot be seen only to operate solely within the dialectic of               Pollock's working method and Rosenberg's action painting proclamation.               His work must be understood within the context of his relationship               with Dali as well. Mathieu and Dali were in close correspondence               in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and it certainly was not lost               on Mathieu that Dali had appeared in <i>Life</i> magazine twice               before Pollock. The <i>Life</i> articles contributed greatly to               Dali's international reputation as a Surrealist performer whose               life and art were largely inseparable. Salvador Dali's first appearance               in <i>Life</i> was in January of 1941 (figure 6), and presented               a &quot;lighthearted&quot; piece, a bit of escapist amusement from               the overbearing presence of World War II photographs. In &quot;<i>Life</i>               Calls on Salvador Dali,&quot; Dali is presented as the &quot;eccentric&quot;               houseguest of wealthy Virginia matron Mrs. Phelps Crosby at her               mansion, Hampton Manor, designed by Thomas Jefferson (figure 7).               Dali is completely de-politicized in the text and photographs of               the article; there is no mention of him as an exile forced to flee               Europe, nor of the similar fate of many artists before or during               the war. Dali is described in terms of comforting, harmless, and               solid American values, like &quot;he's nuts about his wife,&quot;               and is &quot;enchanting&quot; to his host, the eccentric European               aristocrat with the wild moustache. Despite the fact that Dali is               boarding with an aristocratic woman and behaves like a wealthy man               who has time to do wacky things like putting manikins in ponds,               he is still presented as a &quot;man of the people&quot;; he is               photographed at the local store in De Jarette, VA sitting around               the coal stove and talking to the locals. The caption accompanying               the photograph of Dali sitting in the store conversing with De Jarette               citizens reads: &quot;In the general store at De Jarnette, Dali               loafs by the stove and leers at his wife while Mrs. Crosby does               her daily marketing. Small, drab, and populated mostly by Negroes,               De Jarnette attracts Dali daily. He likes to look at the cans in               the store, to drink Cokes, and to converse with the bewildered but               fascinated citizens.&quot; Thus Dali's eccentric, aristocratic behavior               is presented as accessible to the common man, and by inference to               the readership of <i>Life</i>. Dali's surreal life is presented               as harmless and cozy, a down-home, folksy Surrealism designed to               appeal to the readers of <i>Life</i>.</p>			<table width="109" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="119">              <tr>                 <td height="111"><a href="gross_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/grossimages/dali.jpg" width="150" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="33">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="gross_5.html" target="_blank">Fig.                     5 Photograph of Salvador Dali from<br>                    Life Magazin</a>e</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The second article, which appeared in <i>Life</i>               in September of 1945 (figure 5), was concurrent with the victory               of the Allies in Europe. The issue which included Dali's article,               fortunately for him, was perhaps <i>Life</i>'s most popular issue,               containing V-E Day coverage, and the famous photograph of a sailor               kissing a nurse in the celebration at Times Square. News and images               of the war dominated the issue, and tropes of the &quot;support               our boys overseas&quot; variety were dominant in product advertisements.               Dali's self-promotional theatricality is accentuated by columnist               Winthrop Sargeant. The article's title clearly indicates its content:               &quot;Dali: An excitable Spanish artist, now scorned by his fellow               surrealists, has succeeded in making deliberate lunacy a paying               proposition.&quot; <sup>26</sup> Sargeant's description of Dali's performative               persona often sounds like British huckster Robin Leach's shills               for &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; of early 1990s               American TV: &quot;Dali...is not only a surrealist in paint; he               has acted the part of a surrealist in <i>real life</i> [my italics]               to a point that, at times, seems indistinguishable from actual insanity.               The <i>act</i> [my italics] has been amazingly profitable.&quot;<sup>27</sup>               Sargeant goes on to situate Dali's biography within a sketchy historical               account of the emergence of surrealism within modernism, in tune               with Alfred Barr's linear model of 1936. Dali's successful blurring               of the boundaries between art, commerce, performance, and life would               have an impact upon Mathieu.</p>			<p class="second">In 1954, Dali cabled Mathieu from New York: &quot;need 			  to continue paranoiac-critical study of Vermeer's <i>Lacemaker</i> 			  before live rhinoceros stop Arriving Paris next week.&quot;<sup>28</sup> Dali 			  explains that his interest in the rhinoceros at this point was not 			  accidental. Of all living animals with horns, only that of the rhinoceros 			  is constructed as a perfect logarithmic spiral. The spiral was a 			  mystical, archetypal form which was engaged by cultures outside 			  of European cultural history. Dali's search for sources which subverted 			  the classical tradition of western art due to the trauma of World 			  War II and the atom bomb led him to Spanish mysticism as well.<sup>29</sup>			  Mathieu's adoption of the persona of Mathieu de Montmorency for 			  the <i>Battle of the Bouvines</i> parallels Dali's search for non-classical 			  sources. Robert Descharnes, who filmed Mathieu painting, provides 			  another link to Dali: also in 1954 he filmed Dali's reconstitution 			  of <i>The Lacemaker</i> at the Vincennes Zoo in front of a rhinoceros 			  named Frangois.<sup>30</sup></p>			<p class="second">The criticism of Clement Greenberg endowed the work 			  of Pollock and the Abstract Expressionists with a political agenda. 			  Krauss aptly characterizes Greenberg's critical position: &quot;Greenberg's 			  entire critical vocabulary was that of rivalry and of American artists 			  besting the Europeans, outwitting them in the battle for history.&quot;<sup>31</sup> 			  In the March 1948 Partisan Review, Greenberg asserted the shift 			  of &quot;the main premises of Western Art&quot; from Europe to the 			  United States.<sup>32</sup> Greenberg's belief was that The New York School 			  had &quot;wrested the torch of high culture&quot; from an enfeebled, 			  faction-ridden Paris which was threatened internally and externally 			  by communism.<sup>33</sup> Tapi&eacute;, keen to rival Greenberg's apparently 			  strong critical position, sought to be the same vigorous polemicist 			  for European painters that Greenberg was for the American Abstract 			  Expressionists. Tapi&eacute; employed the lofty, mystical rhetoric 			  reminiscent of Bruno Taut, Paul Scheerbart and the German Expressionists:</p>			<p class="second">Everything has been called into question once more 			  since that cascade of revolution going from Impressionism to Dada 			  and Surrealism: we are beginning to realize what that means, and 			  at which point this total review has caused the epoch in which we 			  live to be equally thrilling. After centuries, if not a millennium, 			  during which conditions evolved so slowly that in the normal rhythm 			  of life, chance could not be perceived, and in which artistic problems 			  (even ethic-aesthetic ones) were safe...an entire system of certainty 			  has collapsed. <sup>34</sup> </p>			<p class="second">Tapi&eacute; engages the tropes of Abstract Expressionist 			  promotion (existentialism, masculinity, myth) to situate Mathieu's 			  production. Tapi&eacute; describes the painting of the <i>Battle 			  of the Bouvines</i> as one &quot;in which [Mathieu] has been able 			  to gesticulate to paroxysm the quintessence of his inductive myths.&quot;<sup>35</sup>			  But Tapi&eacute; claims that there is an absurdist, neo-dada element 			  to Mathieu's aristocratic persona echoing that of Dali: &quot;Mathieu 			  regards everything as totally absurd, and shows this continually 			  in his behavior, which is characterized by the most sovereign of 			  dandyisms.&quot;<sup>36</sup> The intention of this absurdity is to willfully 			  &quot;thrust the spectator forcibly outside the absurdity of the 			  humdrum and the mediocre and into that atmosphere of dynamic power 			  the creative-destructive side of which was so masterfully revealed 			  by Nietzsche.&quot;<sup>37</sup> With such lofty, absurdist rhetoric and references 			  to Nietzsche, it is not surprising that American artists and critics 			  misunderstood Mathieu's intentions. The construction of his persona 			  drew from tropes which were anathema to the personae of the pragmatic 			  American Abstract Expressionist painters.</p>			<p class="second">Mathieu's reception in Europe was mixed, but was               acknowledged by Yves Klein as a mentor and fellow monarchist.<sup>38</sup>                Klein's notorious <i>Leap into the Void</i> of 1960 which purports               to document a single, spontaneous, risky leap into space, demonstrates               his debt to Mathieu in terms of staging his art for photography.               But Klein's debt to his mentor is also conceptual and intellectual.               Klein's attention to risk, spontaneity, speed, and improvisation,               carried out in his &quot;living brushes,&quot; and other work, echoes               Mathieu's thinking: In Mathieu's &quot;Towards a New Convergence               of Art, Thought, and Science,&quot; published in 1960, he outlines               what he terms the &quot;phenomenology of painting&quot;: &quot;1.               First and foremost, speed in execution. 2. Absence of pre-meditation,               either in form or movement. 3. The necessity for a subliminal state               of concentration.&quot;<sup>39</sup> Mathieu was also recognized by the Viennese               action artists, who acknowledged his performance in Vienna April               2, 1959, at the Theater am Fleischmarkt, as significant in their               move into action.<sup>40</sup> Traveling to Japan in 1957, Mathieu and Tapi&eacute;               were warmly received by the performance-oriented Gutai Group as               colleagues in exploring a new aesthetic direction.<sup>41</sup> In front of               crowds of people in Tokyo, Mathieu painted twenty-one canvases in               three days, including a fresco approximately 45 feet long.<sup>42</sup>               The September issue of Time magazine covered the event extensively.               Mathieu had come full circle, gaining a major magazine article like               Dali and Pollock, captured forever in words and photographs as an               internationally recognized artist who acts.</p>			<p class="second"><a href="gross_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a> </p>			<p><font class="second"><a href="gross_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> 			  <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Fred Gross.
