I have realized that strict boundaries               between the professional and personal benefit more those whose privilege               allows them to concentrate on one thing at time, or whose areas               of concentration do not compete and conflict. In other words, to               maintain a single and exclusive vision, it helps, first off, to               be minimally involved with children, and, secondly, male or heterosexual.               These aid clarity, unity and high investment in one set of signs,               or values. If, however, the signs of one's life, when assembled               or made visual, are less clearly readable, are, perhaps, mutually               contradictory, what forms does the image take? If the composite               creature that one is leads to a hall of mirrors, of play, double-play,               re-play, of positive and negative, competition between elements,               of nothing one can say with absolute certainty, then how will the               role of formal, impersonal scholarly discourse fullfill its intensive               demands for the singular statement, the thesis? Likewise, the authority               of the scholarly stance, depending upon a theoretical platform,               suffers vertigo when there is no ground to stand on, with an artist,               such as Florence Henri, whose vision is the double, duplicity, play,               signs which cancel themselves, where everything made manifest is               equally impossible. </p>            <p class="second">I had been struggling with my conclusions to the               mirror photography of Florence Henri for some time. That Henri presented               an androgynous vision by playing with opposites and ignoring all               their boundaries was, I felt, well-established in my visual analysis.               The conclusion, however, eluded me, the result of a subject that               snaked past any subject category, any placement, any typical scholarly               summa. Then, my four year old daughter put the conclusion in my               lap. She pulled from my shelf Virginia Woolf's <i>A Room of One's               Own</i> and began to &quot;read&quot; it. I was amused and so reread               that day my twenty-year-old underscorings. I did not expect to find               what I did. Written in the very same year Henri's mirror photography               began, Woolf's thoughts on mirrors, androgyny, and craft echo the               destabilizing and recoupling of Henri's contemporaneous vision.               My topic was enriched purely by accident but in a way also befitting               its subject&#151;the construction of a serendipitous, possible space,               an borderless no-place, where two women who could not possibly have               known each other faced the daunting tasks of putting together the               signs of their lives through arts that had, traditionally, refused               them. Over sixty years later, as I write these words, I understand               these pressures, being, too, a creature in an age where I am given               the right to produce but little tradition for how to accomplish               this with the complexity and inherent contradictions of my life               as a woman, mother, writer, and scholar. </p>            <p class="second">In the spirit of these considerations, I will introduce               biographical information from the life of Florence Henri, as it               is relevant to her mirror photography. The visual effects of the               photographs themselves carry the associations of androgyny, but               knowing that the photographer was bisexual aids our understanding.               Without attempting any claims for a &quot;bisexual vision,&quot;               I will show that bisexual concerns, more precisely, conceptualized               androgyny, infused her work. The concept of being double and doubling,               fundamental to this mirror photography, provides the metaphoric               territory for such concerns, which, I wish to add, are not essentialist               nor causal, but motile, fluid, intellectual, questioning. The concept               of androgyny provided a space for visual ideas, not a statement,               nor a definition. What Henri's mirror photography presents is a               vision that consistently defeats definition, that opens up space               and simultaneously blows apart placement. Her manipulation of signs               of masculine and feminine point to a preoccupation with androgyny,               yet the space is consistently indeterminate, mysterious, &quot;factually&quot;               presented through photographic realism, and physically impossible.               It is a vision from a woman engaged in conceptualizing androgyny,               and committed to synthesizing what to others are contradictions.             </p>            <p class="second">In her work of 1927&#150;1938, Henri introduced               a vast array of reflection and doubling techniques that share in               the experimental spirit of New Vision photography but find in suggestiveness               little counterpart in the work of others. Completely absorbed during               these years with the effects of reflectivity, her work presents               a panoply of doubling and double ideas that raise issues of self-absorption               and self-exteriority, the questioning and instability of space,               confusion and interplay of form and plane, as well as the suppression               and elimination of characteristically photographic phenomena&#151;those               of time, record, documentary detail, social factors, gesture, instantaneousness,               and spontaneity. We can in fact assert that the mirror <b>is</b>               Henri's fundamental vision. Through it, she rendered the art codes               of her time, which were fundamentally unadaptable to the medium               of photography, photographically verifiable.<sup>1</sup> In this               manner, she weds photographic verisimilitude to visions which are,               seemingly, antithetical to photography. Taking the overlap of planes               and superimposition of points of view characteristic of cubism and               foreign to the camera's monocular instant of seized time, Henri               blended forms through aggressive mirror duplication into a photographic               realism that questions the very realism upon which it simultaneously               relies. </p>            <table width="323" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="davis_2.html"><img src="gr/henriselfsm.jpg" width="320" height="274" border="0" alt="Henri Self-Portrait"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth">                    <p>Fig. 2 Courtesy of The J.

Du Pont asserts in her catalogue essay, thought of the               photograph &quot;as a constructed image&quot; in which her &quot;intellect...is               always self-consciously present.&quot;<sup>2</sup> The mirror and               its metaphors suggest this self-consciousness, and no where more               than in Henri's self-portraits. Yet, at the same time, they in their               spatial and planar ambiguity effectively empty or make unstable               realism and symbolic significance. They serve to make the subject               herself unstable and her presence, as well as her relation to the               viewer, layered, ruptured, enigmatic. All reflectivity in her work               becomes a metaphoric extension of this topos&#151;one that introduces               the subject to make it ambiguous, that provides &quot;personality,&quot;               in the form of portraits, only to reveal it as a reflection, or               as an abstract idea; one that calls in question identity and objective               nature and carries this uncertainty further in the suggestion of               a female sexuality free from objective and static positing. Henri's               reflectivity empties traditional significations of object, objectivity,               possession, and position, and substitutes for it a mobile field               of carefully composed suggestive forms that concern more creative               play, an act of juggling signs, than the reality upon which they,               photographically, lay claim.</p>            <p class="second">To write about Henri is enter the space of the mirror,               which destabilizes and inverts what it also clearly reveals. If               such instability is a mark of both the mirror and the Henri photograph,               it, too, was a factor of the photographer's youth.<sup>3</sup> Henri               spent her minority shuffled around Europe and twice orphaned. Leaving               New York at age two, never to return, Henri was left with her maternal               relatives, after the death of her mother. A frequent traveler, Henri's               father took her to the major capitols of Europe until they settled               with her younger brother in 1906 on the Isle of Wight, in England.               After only two years, when Henri was fifteen, her father died, leaving               her an income. She took up residence in Rome with her aunt, Anny               Gori, and her husband, Gino, who ran the Cabaret del Diavolo in               Rome, a hot-spot for musicians and artists such as John Heartfield,               Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and the Futurist circle.</p>            <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" width="115">              <tr>                 <td><img src="gr/flhenristilllife30.jpg" width="150" height="104" border="0"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="2">                   <div align="center">                     <p><br>                      <span class="sixth">Fig. 3<br>                      Still Life 1930</span></p>                    <div align="center"><span class="sixth"><a href="http://www.martini-ronchetti.com">Copyright,                       Galleria Martini &amp; Ronchetti, Genova, Italy. </a></span></div>                    <div align="center" class="sixth"></div>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                  </div>                  <div align="center" class="sixth"></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">After early success as a concert pianist, Henri               gave up music for art, while living in Berlin during the war, a               fertile place for the avant-garde. At this time, she met the coming-to-prominence               art historian, Carl Einstein, who fell in love with Henri and proposed               marriage. She and Carl traveled to Italy together, but, when she               tried to enter France in 1924, she was declared &quot;stateless&quot;               and forbidden to enter. Rather than accept Carl's proposal, she               chose, instead, a marriage of convenience to a Swiss domestic servant,               who provided her with citizenship, entry to France, and the art               world lauded by Einstein, as well as a last name, &quot;Koster,&quot;               which she seldom used but when she did she misspelled, with a &quot;C&quot;               for the &quot;K.&quot; From 1924 onward, Henri is a French resident               with Swiss citizenship who calls herself American, traveling frequently               to Germany and Italy, with artist friends scattered across Europe.               Motility, instability, and independence&#151;whether by choice or               circumstance&#151;are principle factors of her early life. </p>            <p class="second">Motility, independence and indeterminacy are also               factors of her sexuality&#151;an aspect of her life others have               chosen not to discuss in print. The circumstances of her relation               with Einstein remain a mystery. We do know, however, that she never               married in earnest&#151;only as a means to buy a passport&#151;nor               did she have children, though she maintained close and life-long               friendships with many men and women. Further documentation is required               in this area, but it is the conclusion of at least one scholar,               who has supported this through interviews, that Henri was bisexual.<sup>4</sup>               With a photographic syntax that shifts between ample masculine and               feminine associations and consistently empties them, the intellectual               activity of Henri's vision becomes a field of play for desire that               eludes labels, including &quot;bisexual,&quot; yet may be denoted               as &quot;androgynous,&quot; or doubly-sexed.<sup>5</sup></p>            <p class="second">The Paris art milieu helped to form Henri, through               studies for a short while with Andr&eacute; Lhote's Acad&eacute;mie               Montparnasse, and then, more significantly, with Fernand L&eacute;ger               and Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Ozenfant's Acad&eacute;mie Moderne. During               this time, she was painting in an international constructivist style,               when a visit to a friend, Margarete Schall, at the Bauhaus completely               changed her direction. Henri enrolled as an unmatriculated student               for the summer of 1927, with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Vasily Kandinsky,               and Paul Klee as her teachers.</p>            <p class="second">At this time, she was thirty-four, and her maturity               made her the friends as much as the pupils of her teachers. A close               friend was the photographer, Lucia Moholy, who personally encouraged               Henri to pursue photography. Moholy's emphasis on structure and               architecture must have struck a sympathetic chord with the painter's               constructivist training. Also influential was Laszlo Moholy-Nagy,               Lucia's husband, the &quot;formmeister&quot; of the Bauhaus. His               course, though not specifically a photography course, emphasized               the radical camera-optics later to be called the &quot;New Vision.&quot;               In his text, &quot;Photography is a Manipulation of Light,&quot;               Moholy-Nagy emphasized not the objects the medium renders but the               play of photography's light-sensitive values.<sup>6</sup> He advocates               &quot;tricks,&quot; bird's eye and worm's eye views, oblique angles,               the use of mirrors and transparent surfaces, cutting, pasting, and               superimposition,<sup>7</sup> and the collapsed and over-layered               imagery of urban life reflected in shop windows with their &quot;superimpositions               and penetrations.&quot;<sup>8</sup></p>            <p class="second">In <i>Painting, Photography, Film</i> (1925), three               of Moholy-Nagy's photographic examples show reflective objects or               a room reflected in a glass ball or convex mirror.<sup>9</sup> He               further advocates the use of mirrors and other &quot;contrivances&quot;               for a &quot;revaluation [sic] in the field of photography.&quot;<sup>10</sup>               Henri, however, did not use mirrors so much for a reevaluation of               the field, but, rather, as a means by which she can double&#150;reality,               gender, sexuality, and potential. Both a prosthesis and womb, inverted               and inside-out, the camera in Henri's hands becomes androgynous.               Moholy-Nagy disparaged &quot;the associative,&quot;<sup>11</sup>               which forms for Henri a material &quot;text.&quot; Yet, from her               teacher she gleaned an awareness of optical fidelity and visual               complexity. The Henri photograph doubles visual fact along with               associative material and redoubles these until there is no ground               or act to stand upon except that of the process of doubling itself,               thereby emptying customary signs into the sheer force of signification.</p>            <p class="second">Mirrors were part of the L&eacute;ger aesthetic,               as well. In his avant garde film, <i>Ballet M&eacute;canique</i>,               of 1923&#150;24, L&eacute;ger employs a mirrored prism device suggested               to him by Ezra Pound via Alvin Langdon Coburn and his prismatic               vortographs. This device causes a multi-partite splitting of the               subject and a dizzying sway of motion in its reflections. Through               both the use of mirrors and quick cutting, simple industrial and               household forms seem to slide together, interpenetrate, and ricochet,               suggesting the concerns of cubist painting. No doubt Henri knew               of this film and probably saw it, either through L&eacute;ger himself               or through her myriad artist friends.<sup>12</sup> Henri's cubistic               style, therefore, grew not only in response to the L&eacute;ger&#150;Ozenfant               school of painting but perhaps more significantly to the photographic               practices of experimentalism and reflectivity of both L&eacute;ger               and Moholy-Nagy.</p>            <p class="second">In the stimulating and collegiate atmosphere of               the Bauhaus, Henri found herself unable to paint, but she did a               few photographic exercises. The earliest known Henri photograph               is <i>Window Composition (Communal Bath in the Bauhaus)</i>, 1927.<sup>13</sup>               I think it not insignificant that Henri took this first or early               photograph from within the room of a communal bath. The darkened,               steamy space where naked bodies of women commune with water and               perhaps with each other suggests a primordial area, a watery birth,               from which issues of sexuality, identity, vision, and exteriority               can emerge as though reflected in the Bauhaus structure outside               the brightly planar windows, a structure that links to Lucia Moholy's               architectural photographs, the Bauhaus as an institution, and the               building as pure, masculinized form, a form penetrated (in a feminine               manner) by sunlight. The issues of Henri's next eleven years as               a photographer are here encapsulated&#151;reflectivity, identity,               rebirth, sexuality, the body into form, and the slipperiness of               light which can indicate the inconcrete nature of photographic realism.</p>            <p class="second">Henri's inability to paint continued when she returned               to Paris through the autumn of 1927. She began early in 1928 a series               of photographic experiments using mirrors and friends as models.               Encouraged, devoted herself full-time to photography. A group of               mirror and ball compositions along with a self-portrait received               the attention of her teacher, Moholy-Nagy, who published them in               an avant garde Dutch magazine <i>10</i>, later in 1928.<sup>14</sup>               This began a quickly accelerating career of photographic exhibitions,               publishing, and commercial work.<sup>15</sup> Henri's spatial photographic               techniques rapidly grew in sophistication and complexity throughout               these eleven years. The ball and mirrors compositions of 1928 used               only two mirrors and one ball. Nonetheless, the forms seem to float               in an spaceless space, and Henri's careful sense of composition               arranged the billiard balls so that the seam of the mirrors intersects               the ball's reflection of a reflection in a way that makes illusion               apparent. This seam flanks the actual ball, setting it apart as               the &quot;actual&quot; object, and the linear forms of the background               set off the primary reflection. A gate or grates separate the actual               space from the reflected and double-reflected spaces. These spaces,               though ambiguous, flattened, and seeming at first to float are visually               reconstructible as a real setting.</p>            <p class="second">In a <i>Still Life Composition #10</i> of 1928,               Henri used the same techniques and billiard ball, but the space               becomes unreadable. What is resting on or underneath the ball? Where               is gravity? Only when one flips the print upside down does the space               become readable, and we can understand her simple but ingenious               trick.<sup>16</sup> The inversion sets gravity right, and we can               see that this is one ball, with a household sieve which sits, closest               to the picture plane, on top of the ball, surrounding one round               form with the frame of another. We can tell this by the shadows               of the mesh on the highlight of the ball as well as by the reflection               which is rendered in limited focus (making it more abstract). This               limited focus is a factor of mirror vision which is not readily               apparent to the eye sans camera. The mirror reflection, in a different               plane of focus than the object it reflects, will, in the camera's               vision, be out of focus, if one adjusts the focus to the object.               We seldom notice this in perceptual life, however, since our eyes               too quickly adjust to differing planes of focus for us to notice               that they are different. Henri exploits this aspect of camera vision               to assert its paradoxically non-realistic potentials.</p>            <p class="second">In the fruit and mirrors still lifes of 1929 (fig.               3), Henri used four mirrors, three pieces of fruit, a couple of               white boards, and a bowl and saucer, in each, to fracture and parcel               space. The direct, side lighting produces chiaroscuro effects as               well as an ambiguity of shadow. Though complex, they are still re-constructible,               and part of their challenge is for the viewer to decipher the placement               of objects that Henri actually photographed. Employing principles               from cubist painting, Henri made them photographically verifiable&#151;a               matter of planes and reflection rather than multiple exposure. There               is no question that this, though creating a pieced effect, is one               entire shot, and that is its frisson. The scene, though fragmented,               begs for reconstruction.</p>            <p class="second">In another print,<sup>17</sup> an apple exists only               as reflection; the plane of it chops off the saucer from our view.               The reflection of the lemon cuts across three mirror planes which               neatly fragment it with dense black line, and the lemon itself hides               what we know by reflection to exist&#151;the seam between two mirrors.               These seams and croppings suggest a violence to the organic fruit,               a domination of planar vision upon natural objects. They exist not               as independent objects, but as vision; or, rather, they may not               exist at all, suggests the photograph. They are insubstantial. An               undercurrent of sexuality&#151;masculine form containing feminine               objects&#151;runs through these images, but the mirrors confuse               this traditional function.</p>            <p class="second">Henri also employed montage&#151;<i>Still Life</i>,               1929 (fig. 5),<sup>18</sup> and <i>Abstract Composition #76</i>,               1929 . In the first, Henri appeared to have irregularly cut the               borders of photographs which depict reflections of leaves. I suggest               she placed these prints upon a table covered with white and rephotographed               them with actual plants. The ambiguity of this image rests in the               tip of a leaf which crosses the border of one of the prints and               appears to be reflected there, as in a mirror. This telling detail               becomes a point of fixation&#151;is it a &quot;real&quot; reflection,               or a match on the shape of real leaf and imaged leaf? She picked               up the line of one imaged leaf stem with the line of another across               a gap that separates the two prints. In addition, the tonal value               of the table to the left matches the tone of the print backgrounds.               It is no easy matter to distinguish between real, reflected, imaged,               or actual here, and the play between two and three dimensions gives               this photograph an especial lack of fixity. In the second image,               Henri, instead of a bird's eye view upon a table top, produced a               worm's eye view (both reminiscent of Moholy-Nagy). Here, we look               up at a windmill, which Henri photographs twice similarly, taking               the two subtle variations on the same view, a near double, inverting               one (as a mirror inverts), and splicing them together on one board               to form a montage which doesn't at first appear to be a montage               but rather one windmill gone awry. Retouching of the seam to smooth               over the splice and of the vanes on the windmill to more strongly               contrast with the sky, as well as a stippling effect to give the               sky a granular quality, reinforce the over-all design. The retouching               also downplays the cutting of the montage, increasing the illusion               of the singular shot in this mirror-effect image.<sup>19</sup></p>            <p class="second">In <i>Still Life Composition #10</i>, 1931, Henri,               suggests Du Pont (45), has placed a mirror near the lens to reflect               the shadow of the chair in a highly ambiguous manner. This compound               image seems to exist in a strange &quot;space-time warp,&quot; so               that the abstractionist aesthetics of Henri's day prefigure our               day's science-fiction of &quot;hyper-space.&quot; In her series               of Vitrines, or store front windows, c. 1930, we see other reflections               forming the urban superimpositions that Moholy Nagy called for.               Reflecting a world of three dimensions into the planes and patches               of two, these recall the work of Eugene Atget, which were shown               along with Henri's in the &quot;Foto-Auge&quot; exhibition of 1929.<sup>20</sup>               Henri's, though, make space virtually unreadable. In <i>Mirror Reflection               at the Flea Market</i>, Henri has masked a central portion of the               negative during printing, so that this strip appears in the print               to be tonally lighter, increasing the sense of dislocation among               the mirrors, lamps, and the one furtive and androgynous person caught               doubly.</p>            <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" width="130">              <tr>                 <td><a href="davis_3.html"><img src="gr/lanvin1929.jpg" width="172" height="250" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="53">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"> <br>                    <br>                    Fig 4.

In work for Jeanne Lanvin perfume, we see               that the reduplication of one perfume bottle in two mirrors inclined               toward each other and turned slightly toward the camera produces               from one bottle a string of beads (fig. 4). Yet, the edge of the               final mirror reflection chops one bottle-bead in half, emphasizing               that this <b>is</b> illusion, thus making the string-of-beads joyfully               decipherable to the viewer as one bottle. The pleasure of this image               lies in first being fooled and then deciphering the technique.</p>            <p class="second">As we have seen, the Henri image consistently flattens               space or suggests a depth we know to be illusory. Forming a picture               plane which appears unitary in its photographic verism (suggesting               the singular shot), Henri fragmented the photographic moment into               two dimensional splinters, calling into question how we depend on               photographic knowledge as an image of the real. Giovanni Martini               asserts that Henri &quot;simultaneously presents a real image and               a virtual image, soliciting from the viewer a search for the true               identity of the image itself.&quot;<sup>21</sup> Consistently, Henri               played with the concepts of true and false, leaving the viewer neither.               Likewise, male and female associations play across her imagery,               without any resolution but that of indeterminacy itself.</p>            <p class="second">Aspects of androgyny come through most clearly in               the self-portraiture. When we see Florence Henri, as with others               she photographed in her early work, there is seldom a direct glance               at the camera. In fact, except for her commercial work and portraits,               we see faces only in reflection, and/or turned from the camera's               gaze. <i>Margarete Schall in Mirror, with Door</i>, 1928, is not               only reflection only, but her face is averted from ours, towards               her mirror plane reflected in the adjacent mirror, which, itself,               reflects a door we cannot but help read as somehow symbolic, as               though the Schall before us were already departed. Or, perhaps,               Schall faces the photographer and camera, who are absented in the               picture plane but evoked, as one absence to another, by her gaze.               The face of Henri herself, similarly, does not regard the viewer               in all the self-portraits save one. Instead, vision is turned into               itself, narcissistically, yet the mirrored or reflective plane/s               of the image complicates that narcissism, making it unstable or               extending the self-absorption to other associations. In the two               self-portraits of 1928, Henri regards her own image, yet only the               mirror allows us to see her face, so that the mirror of the artist's               self-study is condensed into the picture plane itself, and we assume               the camera-eye not as someone to whom the artist relates but as               an interloper.</p>            <p class="second">In her essays, &quot;Jump Over the Bauhaus&quot;               and &quot;The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism,&quot; Rosalind               Krauss presents a reading of the often reproduced self-portrait               with the chrome balls (fig. 1). Krauss asserts that Henri's mirror               frame within a frame is phallic in shape and in the sense of dominance               or mastery that marks the framing or selection process of the camera.               It is a claim by the photographer for this supremacy and control               accorded to her via photography (&quot;Jump Over the Bauhaus,&quot;               109), a remaking of the real into a cultural production (&quot;The               Photographic Conditions of Surrealism&quot;). Through Krauss, we               can interpret the mirror as phallus and the chrome balls as testicles               and assume Henri was making a masculine self-image and that photography               itself was for her a Lacanian formation of the self which, as does               language for that French linguist, exercises a masculine control               and mastery over her environment in the absence of that very thing               we miss in the photograph&#151;the subject herself. She is only               reflection, having crossed the gap of signifier/signified and landed               squarely on the signified side through the magical ferry of that               omnipresent speech/image master-of-ceremonies, the phallus. In this               light we can consider Henri's bisexuality as one simply of a feminine               to masculine inversion, or a woman who wants to be a man, the camera               her surrogate penis.</p>            <p class="second">This reading becomes problematic, if we take another               look at this &quot;phallus.&quot; In a most un-phallus-like manner,               it introduces <b>depth</b>. The &quot;phallus&quot; allows us to               see further, behind, within, to the dead stop of Henri centered               inside it. It expands to include a room, the photographer's self-regard.               It's a roomy &quot;phallus.&quot; Not only is depth uncharacteristic               of the Henri image, it's definitely uncharacteristic of the phallus.               To be a symbol of power and dominance, the phallus must be, first               of all, opaque, and, most importantly, <b>solid</b>. The Lacanian               phallus does not reveal itself; it operates under concealment, being               akin to unconscious drives, not to self-revelation. What's here,               I propose, is as much, if not more, a vaginal image than a phallus.               The depth the mirror provides leads us to the female subject, squared-off               within this channel, hands folded, calmly regarding her image. As               though her vision could give birth to herself, Henri sits, a locus               and a womb, staring down the perspective lines. The chrome balls,               like two eyes, double themselves in the mirror reflection.</p>            <p class="second">Furthering discussion of reflectivity in this self-portrait               and in other Henri images is Carol Armstrong's &quot;Florence Henri:               A Photographic Series of 1928: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall.&quot;               Armstrong picks up on the vaginal associations of the image, analysizing               them with terms from Lacan's heretical pupil, Luce Irigaray. The               billiard balls of the still lifes suggest eyeballs to Armstrong,               and she metaphorically extends the chrome balls of the self-portrait               to that of specularity itself. Their reflectivity underscores the               Lacanian mirror stage of self-identity fetishized in reflection               and the resultant psychic complications that occur (Armstrong, 225).               The balls and their reflections, as well as Henri's reflectivity               in general, substitute the internal doubling of the camera and photographic               process for the more typical external sight of the machine as phallic               bodily extension (226). Here, we find the typically masculinized               metaphors of photography appropriated to the female body and its               symbolism. Reduplication associates cameras, prints, and the biological               processes of femininity, and in Armstrong's reading, this places               Henri's photography not within the tradition of an exterior vision               positing an object but within an interior or inverted vision, so               that the object is the original subject, and both the nature of               objectivity and subjectivity are questioned. Armstrong associates               this with Irigaray's invoking of the speculum as a &quot;feminine               aspect of the mirror stage&quot; (226).<sup>22</sup> For Armstrong,               however, Henri's specular/speculum is not quite enough to make of               her work a success. The photographer still relies upon traditional               significations of mirror and femininity, and, so, her project of               de-gendering, which Armstrong assumes is her goal, is not thorough               but incomplete.</p>            <p class="second">The two positions of Krauss and Armstrong, superficially               oppositional, are most useful, I believe, combined, for Henri is               playing fast and loose with masculine and feminine symbols. She               provides for them both and maintains the traditional significations               of both, yet she supports neither fully. As a photographer conceptualizing               androgyny, Henri wanted to create not a degendered space but a gender-enhanced               one of multiple and seemingly mutually exclusive meanings. Only               avant-garde based spatial renderings could make the &quot;room&quot;               for such a complicated concept. She posed both masculine and feminine               signifiers in a spatial field which emphasized their motility and               destabilized their concrete significance, a space for the play of               meanings of an artist who wished to see herself, as befits her bisexuality,               a double creature.</p>            <p class="second">In <i>Self-Portrait Lying on the Drafting Table</i>,               1928, Henri appears in the act of her own construction.<sup>23</sup>               Let us compare this to the 1928 male portrait (possibly of a man               named &quot;Charly&quot;)<sup>24</sup> next to a mirror and drafting               table, which associates the structure of the male body to architecture               and culture. Perhaps in these prints, Henri was employing binary               gender opposition of passive object versus masculine presence. Yet,               this interpretation falls apart when we consider that he's wooden,               resembling a marionette, evidently a creation suiting Henri's composition,               and one that seems no more capable of constructing himself than               is the table in front of him. As in a L&eacute;ger painting, this               man is all mechanism, a reduced field that indicates &quot;the erect.&quot;               Henri, by contrast, lies on her drafting table, regarding herself               and the viewer/camera simultaneously, as though she were her own               product, Pygmalion-like, come to life. While the association with               Pygmalion is a highly traditional view of woman, the difference               here is that the creator is <b>she</b> herself, visualizing/drafting               her own image.</p>            <p class="second">In <i>Self-Portrait in a Masked Frame</i>, 1938,               Henri is the reflection itself, popping sculpturally out from the               planar surface of the mirror, as though she were Alice peering back               through the looking glass. In <i>Self-Portrait Seated at Table</i>,               also of 1938, Henri includes no mirror, but, rather, a window out               of which she gazes in reverie. On the left side of the image, however,               is the double&#151;a whitened area which appears to include part               of the table which is cropped by the right hand side of the frame.               There's also the suggestion of a window frame that's also cropped               off the right and, further to the image center, an exterior area.               Henri is giving us her view, inverted from our right side, where               she stares, to the picture's left side, the side towards which she               is turned. As the mirror inverts, so does the presentation of view               and viewer in this witty double-play on our view of a viewer who               presents a laterally-correct view of what she sees as well as herself               seeing it.</p>            <p class="second">In a perhaps apocryphal story in <i>Camera</i> magazine               on Florence Henri, which appeared in 1967 on the cusp of her rediscovery,               an anonymous writer relates how Henri began to photograph after               gazing into a mirror and, seeing her friend's camera equipment,               asking how she might capture her mirror image.<sup>25</sup> This               article, though marred by biographical inconsistencies, strikes               a plausible note. Henri was at that time in a slump, unable to paint.               An independent, bisexual woman, she had learned to be resourceful,               having been at an early age, motherless, fatherless, without a permanent               home or locale, and, eventually, she was declared officially &quot;stateless.&quot;               Once before she had completely reinvented her life&#151;her switch               in Berlin from music to painting. Now, after the Bauhaus, another               reinvention demanded itself. Mirror photography provided the narcissism               that allowed this recreation. The planes of reflectivity allowed               Henri to eliminate time, space, and environment, leveling the field               of representation so that, rather than personality, it could reflect               a woman's act of making culture signify.</p>            <p class="second">Within Henri's imagery are feminine and masculine               signs, but the fractured space, the unreal sense of perspective               or location, the illusions upon illusions, and the absence of one               photography's chief fort&eacute;s, temporal detail, place these               images within the primordial or timeless time. The signs then become               markers for the pathways of associativity. In themselves they carry               little import. In other words, Henri's fruits, dishes, wisps of               hair, her chrome balls, and empty stares never rise to the highly               cathected state of fetishes. Because they are constantly subordinated               to Henri's confusing, a-spatial compositions, they loose their claim               to an elevated status in themselves. Henri's symbols, never more               than images, siphon strength from the photographic claim to truth,               all the while exploiting its realism. Between photography's document               and the mirror's alternative door lies the Henri photograph, a being-in-the-world,               but <b>what</b> world it is impossible to say.</p>            <p class="second">The masculine and feminine signs were important               to Henri, and she wanted both, while at the same time she wanted               neither fully, which is why she made them consistently unstable.               With this in mind, I wish to turn to Virginia Woolf's <i>A Room               of One's Own</i>, written in the very year Henri's mirror photography               began, 1928. Let me say at the outset of my discussion I think it               highly unlikely that Woolf and Henri had any contact. It is not               a matter of influence, here, but, rather, something in the climate               of that time that circulated in Bloomsbury, the Bauhaus, and Paris.               By reading between Woolf's text and Henri's photographs, I propose               that their climate privileged a conception of androgyny as necessary               to the creative woman. The very construct of woman as artist was,               in social acceptance, rather new. Twin constructs, then, androgyny               and the creative woman aided each other, from the Weimar's &quot;New               Woman,&quot; to Bloomsbury's debates on sexuality, to the Left Bank               avant-garde.<sup>26</sup> I will make a brief comparison between               these related worlds through the work of two women, strangers, who               took mirrors and turned them against their constricting symbolism,               who grappled with the problems of how to be a serious artist (and               taken seriously) with precious few female precursors. In the same               year, Woolf and Henri took up the mirror, and despite different               languages and media, used it to assert their right to claim an art               and desire of their own construction. In Woolf's words, such works               &quot;are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of               many years of thinking in common, or thinking by the body of the               people...&quot; (68-69).</p>            <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" width="148" height="213">              <tr>                 <td><img src="gr/henristill29.jpg" width="167" height="173"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="2">                   <div align="center">                     <p class="sixth"><br>                      Fig. 5<br>                      Still Life 1929</p>                    <div align="center"><span class="sixth"><a href="http://www.martini-ronchetti.com">Copyright,                       Galleria Martini &amp; Ronchetti, Genova, Italy.</a> </span></div>                    <div align="center" class="sixth"></div>                    <p class="sixth">&nbsp;</p>                                      </div>                  </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Woolf wrote her by-now classic pair of essays for               two lectures at arts societies composed principally of young women.               It is, therefore, her counsel to them, as young writers. By using               the motif of women with mirrors, as old as the manufacture of mirrors               themselves, she takes up a traditional theme and turns its weapon               against its progenitors. According to the author, patriarchy systematically               denies women their powers, creative and otherwise, and reserves               for them the role of agrandising men, or, at very least, serving               as their glass, granting the male a superiority by way of default               in not being a woman:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses                 possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure                 of man at twice its natural size.

Not &quot;the natural inheritor of...civilisation, she becomes,               on the contrary, outside of it, alien and critical.&quot; (101)</p>            <p class="second">She becomes, then, civilization's double: doppelganger,               antithesis, mirror, anti-mirror.

This is precisely the problem of               the female artist on the cusp of twentieth century modernity: she               cannot see herself, yet she very much needs to. Perhaps this was               what Woolf intimates when she suggests at the conclusion of the               essays that the writer needs to be androgynous, that she use &quot;both               sides of her mind equally,&quot; for &quot;Poetry ought to have               a mother as well as a father.&quot; (107)<br>              A father and a mother within a work&#151;even today, with its essentialist               ring, it may be a radical and destabilizing move. What results is               a no-space, a fractured mirror, a &quot;marriage of opposites&quot;               (108). In one body of work, this can be a threat, for certainty               relies upon roles being predictable, and certainly Woolf and Henri's               works were not. We are propelled, then, into a cognitive space,               of becoming, unreal, but with potential. Prudence, or wisdom, as               Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub reminds us, has the symbol of a mirror,               seeing what others cannot, an ambivalent, dual creature, an anti-Venus,               &quot;the philosophical voice of intelligence.&quot;<sup>28</sup></p>            <p class="second">In the permissive world of the Bauhaus and Paris               in the '20s and '30s, Henri located a potential space for this fusion               of what until her time had been oppositional. Partaking of the mixed               masculine and feminine signals of the Weimar Republic's &quot;New               Woman,&quot; Henri brought such ambiguity to her Bauhaus-inspired               experimentalism. Bringing this home to Paris, an &quot;epicenter               of freedom for gays,&quot;29 Henri used the mirror as a metaphor               for her desire and, by extension, for the confusing, ambiguous,               fluid modern world. By yoking seemingly oppositional qualities in               her atemporal photographic settings, Henri shows an aggressively               destabilized anti-space of mirror and glass, of multiple, contradictory               signs, composites of impossible structure, the restless play of               creator, creation, masculine, feminine, tradition and rupture.</p>            <p class="second">For more information please visit the <span class="sixth"><a href="http://www.martini-ronchetti.com">Galleria               Martini &amp; Ronchetti, Genova, Italy.</a> </span>at <a href="http://www.martini-ronchetti.com">http://www.martini-ronchetti.com</a></p>            <p class="second"><a href="davis_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="davis_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5" height="11">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2002 P<i>ART</i> and Melody Davis.
