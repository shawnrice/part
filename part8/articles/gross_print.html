An article entitled &quot;Mathieu paints a picture&quot;         by Michel Tapi&eacute; appeared in <i>ARTnews</i> in early February 1955,         illustrated with still photographs from Descharnes's film. This article,         in which Tapi&eacute; proselytizes for Mathieu, drew swift and negative         criticism from American Abstract Expressionists. In an ARTnews &quot;Letter         to the Editor&quot; of Feb. 22, 1955, Barnett Newman asks sarcastically,         &quot;are there any readers of <i>ARTnews</i> who wish to join me in sending         a pair of sterling silver roller skates, suitably engraved, to Georges         Mathieu so that he may redo his I WAS THERE dance routine of the <i>Battle         of Bouvines</i> into a big Blitzkrieg production?&quot; Newman goes on         to castigate Mathieu for orchestrating a historical farce in paint, which         he calls a &quot;burlesque of immediacy.&quot; To Newman, Mathieu's painting         was &quot;clumsy and provincial work&quot; that was nonetheless sure to         &quot;have the Rockefellers, the Burdens, the Harry Guggenheims, and the         Jock Whitneys on their knees in admiration.&quot; The critical ire of         Newman and other American painters like Clyfford Still served to stigmatize         Mathieu's painting as shallow and self-promotional, and his artistic persona         as silly, theatrical, and foppishly aristocratic. Such a polemic served         to turn public opinion against Mathieu in the United States which, following         World War II, was largely committed to asserting the cultural hegemony         of Abstract Expressionism.<sup>1</sup> Subsequent art-historical analysis         of Mathieu largely centers on Mathieu's paintings; I want to examine how         he was photographed.</p>      <p class="second">This essay will attempt to reconstruct the art production         of Georges Mathieu in the early to mid-1950s according to the influences         of the public identities of Jackson Pollock and Salvador Dali. These two         sources, and their appearance in popular magazines such a s Life, made         an impression on Mathieu, who in turn had an impact upon emerging performance         art in Europe. The photographic conditions of Pollock and Dali's artistic         personae, and their mythologization (in the Barthesian sense of myth)         by the mass media, involves a shift in the representation of artists in         photographs following World War II, and in the manifestation through photographs         of the &quot;personality of the artist&quot; as both actor and mythmaker.       </p>      <p class="second">The first part of this essay will sketch the representation         of artists in photographs since the turn of the century through a close         reading of relevant examples. A discussion of the construction of Pollock's         photographic persona by Hans Namuth will follow, involving diverse sources         such as Native American rituals, psychoanalysis, phenomenological thinking,         and photographs of Picasso that aided in the personification of the &quot;action         painter&quot; Pollock through photographs. Salvador Dali's appearances         in <i>Life</i>, which involved issues of public promotion, performance,         and display, also had an influence upon Mathieu. The impact of Dali's         and Pollock's photographic promotion upon Mathieu constituted an important         historical shift involving the representation of artists in photographs,         and heralded a fundamental change in the way artists considered their         own production and its documentation and promotion through photographs.         Such a change signaled a move toward a consideration of the art object         as a phenomenological record of movement rather than an a priori form         with an interior &quot;essence.&quot; The indexical quality of photography         became a vital component in the production of the artist's persona by         capturing the physical trace of the artist, arresting his movement.<sup>2</sup>         Not only does Mathieu's production provide a link from the &quot;action         painting&quot; of Pollock and the self-promotial bravado of Dali, it incorporates         issues of politics and national identity as well. Michel Tapi&eacute;         proselytized for Mathieu much in the same way as Clement Greenberg did         for Pollock, involving issues of politics and a nationalist identification         with a mythic hero.</p>      <p class="second">A discussion of Dali, Pollock, and Mathieu must deal with         the central role of photography and the dissemination of photographic         images that captured the performativity of artistic production, and its         circulation into mass culture in the personae of the artist-as-mythmaker.         Most often the photographs took the form of the documentary photograph         at the level of reception. Public consumption of documentary photography         was at a new level of cultural centrality brought about by popular &quot;photo-story&quot;         magazines, with <i>Life</i> leading the way; in many ways, <i>Life</i>         represented the niche television would later fill during the Viet Nam         War. <i>Life's</i> documentary photographs were the primary vehicle for         public consumption of images of the war, and contained an inherent analogical         truth-value that was manipulated by American wartime propaganda. The subject         matter of documentary photographs and their captions were orchestrated         by the photographers to constitute a particular theme, subject to the         magazine's and the government's approval, but the public was not made         aware of such artifice. Thus a certain amount of deception was involved,         playing upon the belief of the public in the truth-value of the documentary         photograph. </p>      <p class="second">&nbsp; </p>      <table width="223" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="171">        <tr>           <td><a href="gross_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/grossimages/steichen.jpg" width="222" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part8/articles/gross_2.htm">Fig. 2 Edward           Steichen&#146;s 1901 photograph of Rodin</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">To understand how Mathieu's artwork is influenced by the         photographs of Pollock and Dali, we must first trace how artists had been         represented in photographs earlier in the century. Analyzing such a lineage         will establish certain tendencies which influenced the decisions of the         photographers of Dali and Pollock, and the way in which these photographs         may be read. Edward Steichen's 1901 photograph of Rodin (figure 2) is         an exemplar of how artists were depicted in the first decades of the 20th         century, and set the<br>        unofficial standard for subsequent photographs of artists. Steichen captures         the French sculptor in a moment of cogito ergo sum: Rodin is presented         in his studio as the artist/philosopher, &quot;le penseur,&quot; who cogitates         before he creates. The awareness of sculpture as an a priori form is inherent         in Rodin's decision-making; such form need only be liberated from the         mass of stone or breathed life from out of the vaporous void which constitutes         the space of the studio--a space of quasi-divine creation given a physical         corollary by the analogical nature of the photograph. The vapor in Steichen's         photograph of Rodin's studio may be said to represent the physical manifestation         of Rodin's artistic genius, given physical substance by light, which draws         a link between Rodin's thought, the studio space, and the sculpture he         has created. </p>      <p class="second">Alexander Liberman was inspired by Steichen's photograph         of Rodin, and contributed to what was a growing genre of &quot;artist         photographs.&quot; Lieberman photographed Matisse, Picasso, Braque, and         Giacometti, among others. Many of Lieberman's photographs were published         in <i>Vogue</i> and <i>ARTnews</i> in the late 1940s and 50s together         with accompanying essays on the artists and their work.<sup>3</sup> The         photograph of Giacometti entitled <i>Concentration (Alberto Giacometti         in his Studio)</i> of c. 1951 continues in the tradition of Steichen's         Rodin in capturing the artist as the isolated male genius. Liberman's         photograph may be said to embody the visual equivalent of Jean-Paul Sartre's         characterization of Giacometti in &quot;The Search for the Absolute,&quot;         written in 1948. Sartre considered Giacometti to be a sculptor who worked         &quot;outside of history.&quot;</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second">What must be understood is that these figures, who are           wholly and all at once what they are, do not permit one to study them.           As soon as I see them, they spring into my visual field as an idea before           my mind; the idea alone is at one stroke all that it is... the original           movement of creation, that movement without duration, without parts,           and so well imaged by these long, gracile limbs, traverses their Greco-like           bodies, and raises them toward heaven. I recognize in them, more clearly           in an athlete of Praxiteles, the figure of man, the real beginning and           absolute source of gesture [my italics]. Giacometti has been able to           give this matter the only truly human unity: the unity of the Act.<sup>4</sup>         </p>      </blockquote>      <p class="second">For Sartre, Giacometti's sculpture embodied the existentialist,         transcendental, unitary gesture. Giacometti's &quot;gesture,&quot; his         additive process, signifies for Sartre the appearance of a phenomenological         activity of movement without duration&quot; which creates the &quot;idea&quot;         of man in sculpture. Sartre considers Giacometti's work to be equivalent         to the signification of man in art for the first time, much like the lines         which compose stick figures of cave paintings. The index, the physical         trace of the artist's hand, is a vehicle for the revelation of the &quot;language&quot;         of art which cannot be known a priori, only experienced in a phenomenological         sense.</p>      <p class="second">Giacometti, like Steichen's Rodin, sits in shadowy profile,         his head in his left hand, in a moment of what appears to be intense concentration.         We notice his sculptures and studio objects readily enough, but what really         holds our attention are the scrawlings and scratches on the wall behind         him. These indexical marks serve as a physical corollary to the unitary         gesture Sartre speaks of, and provide a visual analogy to Sartre's studio         as a &quot;cave&quot; where &quot;primitive&quot; scrawlings adorn the         walls.<sup>5</sup> Liberman's photograph of Giacometti does not create         an ethereal, mystic atmosphere like Steichen's photograph of Rodin. Conversely,         physical traces of Giacometti's &quot;existential anguish&quot; within         the clearly articulated space of the studio are focused upon.<sup>6</sup>         But the conception of the artist as an isolated genius remained the same,         and would affect how the Abstract Expressionists were photographed.</p>      <table width="152" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td height="199"><a href="gross_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/picasso2.jpg" width="200" height="212" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>                     <div align="center" class="sixth">Fig. 3 Picasso&#146;s Space Drawings,           photograph Gjon Mili</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">The collaboration between Namuth and Pollock has its roots         in Namuth's knowledge of earlier projects involving Picasso. Namuth knew         about Paul Haesaert's film &quot;Visite &aacute; Picasso,&quot; shot in         1949 and released in spring 1950, in which Picasso paints on a vertical         pane of glass, behind which the camera recorded the master in action.<sup>7</sup>         Pollock would probably not have seen illustrations from Haesaert's film,         but he certainly would have seen the next best thing: Picasso's <i>Space         Drawings</i> photographed by Gjon Mili and not<br>        only widely published in 1950 but exhibited as well at The Museum of Modern         Art. (figure 3).<sup>8</sup> Mili's photograph of Picasso captures him         drawing in space with a flashlight what appears to be a bull or a minotaur.         The long exposure arrests Picasso's motions as one continuous, flowing         line of light. The vertical, two-dimensional plane of the photograph,         then, becomes the plane of the canvas. Picasso wears nothing but shorts         and sandals, and has finished his gesticulations with the flashlight in         a balanced, athletic crouch that emphasizes his physical agility. The         light drawing, arrested for our eye by the long exposure, only exists         by the intersection of photography, just as the gait of a running horse         was proven by Muybridge to have all four hooves off of the ground simultaneously--information         about movement unavailable to the naked eye. Movement through space and         the duration of this movement are arrested and coded by the photograph.         The phenomenological articulation of Picasso's movements become the sum         of their parts; for Namuth's photographs of Pollock, this meant that the         creation of art rests upon the articulation of that movement within the         space of the studio frozen by the camera and reproduced in popular magazines         like film stills. </p>      <p class="second"><br>      </p>      <table width="175" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="gross_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/grossimages/poll3.jpg" width="205" height="210" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>                     <div align="center" class="sixth">Fig. 4 Namuth, Pollock in his studio,           1950</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">Namuth's photographs of Jackson Pollock (figure 4) were         taken in the summer and early fall of 1950 in Pollock's studio with the         intention of mythologizing the already-infamous painter. Pollock had first         appeared in a magazine in December 1947 when <i>Time</i> reported the         opinion of Clement Greenberg, critic for <i>The Nation</i>, that Pollock         was one of the three best American artists.<sup>9</sup> Pollock appeared         in <i>Vogue</i> in 1948, and twice in <i>Life</i>. In 1949, <i>Life</i>         asked its readers, &quot;Jackson Pollock: Is he the Greatest Living Painter         in the United States?&quot;<sup>10</sup> The photographs and text seemed         to indicate that the answer was &quot;yes.&quot;<sup>11</sup> During this         period, Namuth made over 500 photographs, a black and white movie, and         a color movie (with Paul Falkenberg), all of Pollock at work. These photographs         and films are pivotal to reckoning Pollock as a mythical figure.<sup>12</sup>         Namuth's photographs of Pollock moving around the canvas on the floor         of his studio served to confirm the persona of Pollock, which had been         developed by numerous articles and photographs appearing in the mass media.<sup>13</sup>         Pollock sought non-traditional artistic sources such as Native American         shamans to engage the space &quot;between the easel and the mural,&quot;<sup>14</sup>         but still was acutely aware of his position within the larger development         of avant-garde painting, which had been abstracted into model form by         Alfred Barr in 1936.<sup>15</sup> In 1947, Pollock stated that &quot;I         believe the time is not yet ripe for a full transition from easel to mural.         The pictures I contemplate painting would constitute a halfway state,         an attempt to point out the direction of the future, without arriving         there completely.&quot;<sup>16</sup> Due to the influx of influential         European surrealists before or during the war, American artists like Pollock         were forced to reconsider their approaches to art production. Disenchantment         with political strife in Europe and a rejection of what was considered         &quot;decadent&quot; classical aesthetic sources led both the Surrealists         and American artists to search for non-western sources for their inspiration.         The Surrealists's belief in the use of dreams, metamorphosis, and myth         as subject matter for art radically altered the American artists's perception         of what their own role as an artist should be. Barnett Newman looked at         the art of Oceania and the pre-Columbian Americas, Pollock at Native American         sand painting and shamanic ritual dance. Adolph Gottlieb examined prehistoric         petroglyphs, and Mark Tobey was deeply influenced by Bahai and Zen. Such         sources were romanticized by American artists to a degree; however, the         tropes of such non-Western sources were not utilized to draw attention         to these cultures, but to engage their &quot;primitive power&quot; as         a means of circumventing the outmoded stylistic conventions of European         art. </p>      <p class="second">Through the Surrealists, Pollock developed an acute interest         in psychoanalysis. In 1939, Pollock began four years of psychotherapy         that would aid him in an identification with the growing interest in the         themes of Jungian thought. Pollock identified with Jung's notion of a         &quot;collective unconscious&quot; that all human beings share at a level         of archetypal recognition.<sup>17</sup> Jung's postulation of a &quot;phenomenology         of the self&quot; fused tenets of psychoanalysis and phenomenology into         a construction of the &quot;self&quot; (analogous the to the Freudian         ego) whose unconscious was regulated by internal and external stimuli,         creating a &quot;field&quot; of experience and a response to stimuli of         which the conscious ego is but one part.<sup>18</sup> The other part is         an &quot;extra-conscious&quot; psyche whose &quot;contents are impersonal         and collective...form[ing]...an omnipresent, unchanging, and everywhere         identical quality or substrate of the psyche per se.&quot;<sup>19</sup>         For Pollock, Jung's thought seemed homologous with the mythic subject         matter of American Indian ritual, which involved a process of engaging         the tangible world to express the universal or mythological. Such a process         for Pollock involved a fundamental reorientation of the role of the artist         from that of the thinker to that of the &quot;act-or.&quot;</p>      <p class="second">Harold Rosenberg, for example, described this meaning         as the transcription of an artist's inner emotions by means of a pictorial         or sculptural &quot;act.&quot; &quot;A painting that is an act,&quot;         Rosenberg wrote, &quot;is inseparable from the biography of the artist.         The painting itself is a moment in the inadulterated mixture of his life.&quot;<sup>20</sup>         Or, again, &quot;Art...comes back into painting by way of psychology.         As Wallace Stevens says of poetry, it is a process of the personality         of the poet.&quot;<sup>21</sup> Rosalind Krauss mentions that </p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second">In speaking this way, Rosenberg is equating the painting           itself with the physical body of the artist who made it. Just as the           artist is made up of a physiognomic exterior and an inner psychological           space, the painting consists of a material surface and an interior which           opens illusionistically behind that surface. This analogy between the           psychological interior of the artist and the illusionistic interior           of the picture makes it possible to see the pictorial object as a metaphor           for human emotions that well up from the depths of those two parallel           inner spaces.<sup>22</sup> </p>      </blockquote>      <p class="second">For Rosenberg, the picture surface as a locus of gestural         marks demanded that one look at it as a map on to which one could read         the complexity of the artist's psychological condition--a physical transcription         of the artist's inner self.<sup>23</sup> Rosenberg's seminal article re-affirmed         Steichen's encoding of the image of the artist as an isolated genius,         but not as &quot;le penseur,&quot; the inert and bearded demiurge. Rosenberg's         &quot;action painter&quot; moved through his work and through the world,         linking the body of the painter and his genius with the artwork itself.         Thus the &quot;inner life&quot; of the painting is a physical register         of the phenomenal experience of the painter, and a tangible articulation         of his psychological, existential necessity. </p>      <p class="second">Mathieu's work of the early 1950s may be said to literalize         Rosenberg's &quot;Action Painters&quot; mantra. Realizing the importance         of Namuth's photographs, Mathieu was the first artist to stage live action         painting as the subject of photography, and as a performance before a         viewing public. On January 19, 1952, he had his picture taken in his own         studio while painting <i>Hommage au Marichal de Turenne</i>, a canvas         that he consigned to his &quot;Zen&quot; period, and one loosely in the         style of the German gestural painter Hans Hartung, whose work he respected.         The conceptualization of painting a picture for the camera clearly emerged         from Mathieu's deep admiration for Pollock, whom he considered the greatest         living painter. Through the example of Pollock, Mathieu realized the potential         connection between painting, photography, performance, and the public.<sup>24</sup>         The documentary nature of the photograph, given world attention by magazines         like <i>Life</i>, carried the content of painting and the process of performance         to the public. Mathieu was the first to synthesize this connection.<sup>25</sup></p>      <p class="second">But Mathieu's <i>Battle of the Bouvines</i>(figure 1)         cannot be seen only to operate solely within the dialectic of Pollock's         working method and Rosenberg's action painting proclamation. His work         must be understood within the context of his relationship with Dali as         well. Mathieu and Dali were in close correspondence in the late 1940s         and early 1950s, and it certainly was not lost on Mathieu that Dali had         appeared in <i>Life</i> magazine twice before Pollock. The <i>Life</i>         articles contributed greatly to Dali's international reputation as a Surrealist         performer whose life and art were largely inseparable. Salvador Dali's         first appearance in <i>Life</i> was in January of 1941 (figure 6), and         presented a &quot;lighthearted&quot; piece, a bit of escapist amusement         from the overbearing presence of World War II photographs. In &quot;<i>Life</i>         Calls on Salvador Dali,&quot; Dali is presented as the &quot;eccentric&quot;         houseguest of wealthy Virginia matron Mrs. Phelps Crosby at her mansion,         Hampton Manor, designed by Thomas Jefferson (figure 7). Dali is completely         de-politicized in the text and photographs of the article; there is no         mention of him as an exile forced to flee Europe, nor of the similar fate         of many artists before or during the war. Dali is described in terms of         comforting, harmless, and solid American values, like &quot;he's nuts         about his wife,&quot; and is &quot;enchanting&quot; to his host, the eccentric         European aristocrat with the wild moustache. Despite the fact that Dali         is boarding with an aristocratic woman and behaves like a wealthy man         who has time to do wacky things like putting manikins in ponds, he is         still presented as a &quot;man of the people&quot;; he is photographed         at the local store in De Jarette, VA sitting around the coal stove and         talking to the locals. The caption accompanying the photograph of Dali         sitting in the store conversing with De Jarette citizens reads: &quot;In         the general store at De Jarnette, Dali loafs by the stove and leers at         his wife while Mrs. Crosby does her daily marketing. Small, drab, and         populated mostly by Negroes, De Jarnette attracts Dali daily. He likes         to look at the cans in the store, to drink Cokes, and to converse with         the bewildered but fascinated citizens.&quot; Thus Dali's eccentric, aristocratic         behavior is presented as accessible to the common man, and by inference         to the readership of <i>Life</i>. Dali's surreal life is presented as         harmless and cozy, a down-home, folksy Surrealism designed to appeal to         the readers of <i>Life</i>.</p>      <table width="109" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="119">        <tr>           <td height="111"><a href="gross_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/grossimages/dali.jpg" width="150" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="33">                     <div align="center" class="sixth">Fig. 5 Dali, photography from Life Magazine,1945</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">The second article, which appeared in <i>Life</i> in September         of 1945 (figure 5), was concurrent with the victory of the Allies in Europe.         The issue which included Dali's article, fortunately for him, was perhaps         <i>Life</i>'s most popular issue, containing V-E Day coverage, and the         famous photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse in the celebration at Times         Square. News and images of the war dominated the issue, and tropes of         the &quot;support our boys overseas&quot; variety were dominant in product         advertisements. Dali's self-promotional theatricality is accentuated by         columnist Winthrop Sargeant. The article's title clearly indicates its         content: &quot;Dali: An excitable Spanish artist, now scorned by his fellow         surrealists, has succeeded in making deliberate lunacy a paying proposition.&quot;         <sup>26</sup> Sargeant's description of Dali's performative persona often         sounds like British huckster Robin Leach's shills for &quot;Lifestyles         of the Rich and Famous&quot; of early 1990s American TV: &quot;Dali...is         not only a surrealist in paint; he has acted the part of a surrealist         in <i>real life</i> [my italics] to a point that, at times, seems indistinguishable         from actual insanity. The <i>act</i> [my italics] has been amazingly profitable.&quot;<sup>27</sup>         Sargeant goes on to situate Dali's biography within a sketchy historical         account of the emergence of surrealism within modernism, in tune with         Alfred Barr's linear model of 1936. Dali's successful blurring of the         boundaries between art, commerce, performance, and life would have an         impact upon Mathieu.</p>      <p class="second">In 1954, Dali cabled Mathieu from New York: &quot;need         to continue paranoiac-critical study of Vermeer's <i>Lacemaker</i> before         live rhinoceros stop Arriving Paris next week.&quot;<sup>28</sup> Dali         explains that his interest in the rhinoceros at this point was not accidental.         Of all living animals with horns, only that of the rhinoceros is constructed         as a perfect logarithmic spiral. The spiral was a mystical, archetypal         form which was engaged by cultures outside of European cultural history.         Dali's search for sources which subverted the classical tradition of western         art due to the trauma of World War II and the atom bomb led him to Spanish         mysticism as well.<sup>29</sup> Mathieu's adoption of the persona of Mathieu         de Montmorency for the <i>Battle of the Bouvines</i> parallels Dali's         search for non-classical sources. Robert Descharnes, who filmed Mathieu         painting, provides another link to Dali: also in 1954 he filmed Dali's         reconstitution of <i>The Lacemaker</i> at the Vincennes Zoo in front of         a rhinoceros named Frangois.<sup>30</sup></p>      <p class="second">The criticism of Clement Greenberg endowed the work of         Pollock and the Abstract Expressionists with a political agenda. Krauss         aptly characterizes Greenberg's critical position: &quot;Greenberg's entire         critical vocabulary was that of rivalry and of American artists besting         the Europeans, outwitting them in the battle for history.&quot;<sup>31</sup>         In the March 1948 Partisan Review, Greenberg asserted the shift of &quot;the         main premises of Western Art&quot; from Europe to the United States.<sup>32</sup>         Greenberg's belief was that The New York School had &quot;wrested the         torch of high culture&quot; from an enfeebled, faction-ridden Paris which         was threatened internally and externally by communism.<sup>33</sup> Tapi&eacute;,         keen to rival Greenberg's apparently strong critical position, sought         to be the same vigorous polemicist for European painters that Greenberg         was for the American Abstract Expressionists. Tapi&eacute; employed the         lofty, mystical rhetoric reminiscent of Bruno Taut, Paul Scheerbart and         the German Expressionists:</p>      <p class="second">Everything has been called into question once more since         that cascade of revolution going from Impressionism to Dada and Surrealism:         we are beginning to realize what that means, and at which point this total         review has caused the epoch in which we live to be equally thrilling.         After centuries, if not a millennium, during which conditions evolved         so slowly that in the normal rhythm of life, chance could not be perceived,         and in which artistic problems (even ethic-aesthetic ones) were safe...an         entire system of certainty has collapsed. <sup>34</sup> </p>      <p class="second">Tapi&eacute; engages the tropes of Abstract Expressionist         promotion (existentialism, masculinity, myth) to situate Mathieu's production.         Tapi&eacute; describes the painting of the <i>Battle of the Bouvines</i>         as one &quot;in which [Mathieu] has been able to gesticulate to paroxysm         the quintessence of his inductive myths.&quot;<sup>35</sup> But Tapi&eacute;         claims that there is an absurdist, neo-dada element to Mathieu's aristocratic         persona echoing that of Dali: &quot;Mathieu regards everything as totally         absurd, and shows this continually in his behavior, which is characterized         by the most sovereign of dandyisms.&quot;<sup>36</sup> The intention of         this absurdity is to willfully &quot;thrust the spectator forcibly outside         the absurdity of the humdrum and the mediocre and into that atmosphere         of dynamic power the creative-destructive side of which was so masterfully         revealed by Nietzsche.&quot;<sup>37</sup> With such lofty, absurdist rhetoric         and references to Nietzsche, it is not surprising that American artists         and critics misunderstood Mathieu's intentions. The construction of his         persona drew from tropes which were anathema to the personae of the pragmatic         American Abstract Expressionist painters.</p>      <p class="second">Mathieu's reception in Europe was mixed, but was acknowledged         by Yves Klein as a mentor and fellow monarchist.<sup>38</sup> Klein's         notorious <i>Leap into the Void</i> of 1960 which purports to document         a single, spontaneous, risky leap into space, demonstrates his debt to         Mathieu in terms of staging his art for photography. But Klein's debt         to his mentor is also conceptual and intellectual. Klein's attention to         risk, spontaneity, speed, and improvisation, carried out in his &quot;living         brushes,&quot; and other work, echoes Mathieu's thinking: In Mathieu's         &quot;Towards a New Convergence of Art, Thought, and Science,&quot; published         in 1960, he outlines what he terms the &quot;phenomenology of painting&quot;:         &quot;1. First and foremost, speed in execution. 2. Absence of pre-meditation,         either in form or movement. 3. The necessity for a subliminal state of         concentration.&quot;<sup>39</sup> Mathieu was also recognized by the Viennese         action artists, who acknowledged his performance in Vienna April 2, 1959,         at the Theater am Fleischmarkt, as significant in their move into action.<sup>40</sup>         Traveling to Japan in 1957, Mathieu and Tapi&eacute; were warmly received         by the performance-oriented Gutai Group as colleagues in exploring a new         aesthetic direction.<sup>41</sup> In front of crowds of people in Tokyo,         Mathieu painted twenty-one canvases in three days, including a fresco         approximately 45 feet long.<sup>42</sup> The September issue of Time magazine         covered the event extensively. Mathieu had come full circle, gaining a         major magazine article like Dali and Pollock, captured forever in words         and photographs as an internationally recognized artist who acts.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        &nbsp; </p>    <p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
