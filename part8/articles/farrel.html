In the text, Barthes identified the photograph               as being &quot;of his [Nadar's] mother (or of his wife-no one knows               for certain).&quot;<sup>3</sup> This ambiguity allowed Barthes to               view the image through his own bereavement-the death of his mother-the               event that propelled him to search for the ontology of photography,               a medium he declared to be structured by loss. That Barthes included               a portrait by Nadar in a book on photography is hardly surprising,               as Nadar has generally been considered one of the premier portraitists               since the time he opened his studio. It is also not surprising that               Barthes would chose to project his own longing onto this image,               creating a narrative suited to his own purpose as the book is a               personal meditation on photography, structured by preferences, or               as he claimed &quot;I like / I don't like.&quot;<sup>4</sup> The               photograph that inspired Barthes is markedly different from the               images most often associated with Nadar, both in subject, relation               and time.<sup>5</sup></p>			<p class="second">Celebrated during his lifetime as one of the greatest               photographic portraitists, Gaspard F&eacute;lix Tournachon, known               as Nadar received particular renown for his informal photographic               and caricature archive of the cultural generated by his photographic               portraits of celebrated subjects, players of the mid to late Nineteenth               century Paris--&quot;la vie boh&eacute;me&quot;-the world in which               he portrayed himself as belonging. Despite the acclaim the primary               benefit was financial, as the majority of his photographs were cartes               des visites commissioned because of his fame. It was through these               quotidian photographs that he was able to support himself and fund               his other projects. </p>			<p class="second">Nadar stated that the goal of the photographer was               to capture the &quot;moral intelligence of your subject - that rapid               tact which puts you in communion with your model...and which permits               you to give ...the most familiar and favorable resemblance, the               intimate resemblance.&quot;<sup>6</sup> His collodion-on-glass negative               photographic portraits contained detailed views; figures seated               or standing in three-quarter body shots against neutral backdrops.               Like other portrait photographers, Nadar utilized props and costumes,               such as drapery, in his photography, yet as opposed to other contemporary               portraitists, such as Andr&eacute; Adolphe Eug&egrave;ne Disd&eacute;ri               (credited as the inventor of the <i>carte de visite</i>), Nadar's               photographs transmited their information through a minimum of sources.               Attention was directed to the subjects through the simplicity of               the set; instead of employing elaborate backdrops, his subjects               were generally seated, facing the camera either frontally or at               a three-quarter view. Lighting was both natural and artificial,               directed through the use of mirrors to create dramatic shadows,               contrasting light tones against dark to enframe his subjects in               an aura of light, intended to mirror their personal aura. This luminosity               made subjects appear aglow, as if lit from within, an effect amplified               by the intense smoothness of the pictorial surface.</p>            <p class="second">While the props were minimal, the surfaces were               detailed, drawing attention to the intensity of textural details.               The use of props may contain clues to gender roles and identities,               roles that may have been emphasized or dramatized for the camera               in a type of studio performance. The photographs have an aura of               naturalism. The subjects were generally shown in clothing instead               of costumes, which had the effect of amplifying this effect. The               clothing was chosen over costumes so as to direct attention to the               character of the subjects, as constructed through clothing, poses               and facial expressions, versus the theatrical distraction of costumes.               More than anything else, what has been said to characterize Nadar's               portraits was his apparent rapport with his subjects, so as to appear               more as collaboration than as a relationship between client and               businessman or subject and operator. A central question is how this               relationship operates when the client or the subject is a woman.</p>			<p class="second"> A portrait is conventionally read as a provider 			  of information-specific details of the subject, mainly physical, 			  are reproduction and represented by the artist. Because photography 			  is an indexical art, the photographic portrait has additional claims 			  to veracity; it is this very claim that leads Barthes to declare 			  that &quot;every photograph is a certificate of presence.&quot;<sup>7</sup> 			  The portrait photograph typifies what Roland Barthes describes as</p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second"> ...a superimposition here: of reality and of 				the past. And since this constraint exists only for Photography 				...[it is] the very essence, the <i>noeme</i> of Photography...neither 				Art nor Communication, it is Reference, which is the founding 				order of Photography. The name of Photography's <i>noeme</i> will 				therefore be: 'That-has-been,' or again: the Intractable.<sup>8</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">According to Barthes, photography, structured by               the &quot;That-has-been,&quot; carries within it information, rather               than meaning. Nadar's photographic portraits, however, are more               than mere conveyers of biographic information, rather, they are               essentially &quot;open works,&quot; where a multitude of information               resides in the betweens - in the shadows, the lighting, the folds               of the work such as Umberto Eco describes in <i>The Open Work</i>.<sup>9</sup>               Yet, in order for the photographic portrait to convey information               about the subject, it must first convey information about the world               in which the subject operates. As Max Kozloff writes in &quot;Nadar               and the Republic of Mind,&quot; </p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second"> Let's define a portrait as the picture of an 				individual or group whose character is either described by social, 				ethnic, and class affiliations, or may, in some measure, be invoked 				in contrast to them. Sometimes, in the history of the genre, the 				&quot;personality&quot; of the sitter has gained the upper hand, 				and, sometimes, his or her status. More often the portrait turns 				out to be an unpredictable composite image of both.<sup>10</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second"> In Nadar's portraits of artists, male artists were 			  generally photographed in clothing intended to present bourgeois 			  respectability and modernity. Although the clothing was actually 			  often borrowed from Nadar's studio, it was to have the appearance 			  of being what the subject had worn to the studio. The same straight-forward 			  quality which characterized the portraits was applied to the clothing 			  of the male subject, where nothing was to distract from the physiognomic 			  appearance of the subjects and their &quot;moral intelligence&quot; 			  of which Kozloff writes. However, with his feminine subjects, what 			  was emphasized was less their &quot;moral intelligence&quot; than 			  their physical or corporal presence. </p>			<p class="second">Kozloff writes of Nadar's &quot;republic of mind&quot; 			  stating that </p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second"> Nadar's republic of mind can't be said to have 				formed any counterculture within the Second Empire, as if it were 				simply a question of hip versus straight life-styles. On the contrary, 				time and again, his artist characters present themselves in the 				severest terms, the most funereal raiment. In an essay on the 				P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery, Frederick Brown writes: 'Black 				broadcloth had always been a flag of sobriety in which Europe's 				bourgeoisie draped itself, not with any illusions that clothing 				made the man, but, on the contrary, hoping that it would serve 				to hide him.' It's a sign of their imaginative astuteness that 				Nadar's sitters often seemed to have used the costume of the bourgeois 				anonymity to reveal themselves. It became a foil against which 				they dramatized, for posterity's benefit, a vision of their own 				unique and sovereign identity. Nadar seems instinctively to have 				grasped this, in defining just that moment when the face ripens 				into characteristic self-assertion, toward which the body also 				swells.<sup>11</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second"> Kozloff's description is revealing on several counts.               First of all, it is telling that Nadar and his bohemian subjects               would choose to adopt the bourgeois uniform. Secondly, one would               assume that Nadar's photographs specifically, Nadar's photographs               of artists, were solely of men. While men do comprise the undeniable               vast majority of the photographic portraits, particularly the portraits               of artists, female artists, such as Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Sand               and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, were also photographed by Nadar,               with Bernhardt and Sand being photographed several times. Although               these images are generally included in surveys of Nadar's work,               the critical writing about Nadar has neglected to address the questions               of gender difference, the effect of gender on the photograph, or               to clarify how gender was constructed and portrayed. For it could               be argued that Nadar's photographs not only portrayed his subjects               physically clothed as the bourgeoisie, but that his works themselves               were clothed in bourgeois conventions, expressing conventional ideas               of gender and gendered roles. Yet within this bourgeois covering               were ruptures and folds, areas of between, overlaps and divisions               that revealed schisms and disruptions within that order. It is in               this area of gaps and irregularity that his photographs appear to               be uniquely suited to operate because it is through operating in               these folds that the photographs reveal gender difference of late               nineteenth century Paris bohemian and bourgeois culture.<sup>12</sup>               Through their photographic construction, Nadar's photographs can               be read as conveying the idea that gender itself is a construction,               something adopted or staged through props and accessories or something               put on, like a costume or a painted mask. Gender did play a central               role in how the women are presented, if nothing else, because they               were denied the option of the black suit of the bourgeoisie, that               &quot;flag of sobriety in which Europe's bourgeoisie draped itself,&quot;               that symbol of modernity of which Baudelaire wrote. </p>			<p class="second">&nbsp; </p>            <p class="second">As early as 1856 at the Brussels Photography exhibition               of 1856, Nadar was noticed for his 'ravishing portraits of women.'&quot;<sup>13</sup>               From the beginning of his career as a caricaturist, women artists               were represented in Nadar's oeuvre, as evidenced by the celebrated               <i>Panth&eacute;eon Nadar</i> of 1854 and 1858. In his female photographic               portraits, Nadar created a distinction between photographs of women               he considered artists-celebrated women such as Marceline Desbordes-Valmore               and George Sand-who were generally older and members of &quot;la               vie bohe&egrave;me&quot; and whose portraits he exhibited with male               artists, and his photographs of young models, actresses, dancers<sup>14</sup>               that he exhibited with portraits of children and nature studies.<sup>15</sup>               A third category can be added to the other two-photographs of his               wife, Ernestine. Nadar's photographs reveal that he adopted different               modes of portraiture for each group, reflecting different concepts               of gender construction and socio-economic position, in addition               to his own relationship with the subject.</p>			<table width="106" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="212">              <tr>                 <td><a href="farrell_4.html"><img src="gr/farrellimages/marceline.jpg" width="126" height="171" alt="Click for Larger Image" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"> Nadar, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore,                     1854.

Artists such as George Sand (1864) and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore               (1864) were shown dressed as proper bourgeois ladies, and although               they could not adopt the black suited uniform of the male bourgeois,               their clothing reflected and conveyed their status and position               within this class. The frail frame of Desbordes-Valmore is shown               properly attired beneath layers of clothing: patterned scarves cover               her head, a stripped bow is tied beneath her chin in a particularly               infantalizing gesture, contrasting with the refined, dark color               of her dress, whose somberness is interrupted by flouncy white ruffs               at her wrists and on her chest. Her black lace covered hands rest               on her lap, her arms bent slightly, making them pull away from her               body, as she appears to adopts the pose of male artists also shown               seated in such a position. Yet within this rather stiff and conventional               pose, the position and gesture of her hands becomes particularly               interesting. Her right hand rests on a raised leg, obscured by the               heavy fabric of her dress. Beneath the intricate black lace glove,               bent fingers appear, one flashing a gold band, the other appearing               to point to her lap. Her left hand is slightly arched, her first               three fingers more visible, almost fully extended, as the index               and middle finger separate in the form of scissors, one form appearing               to mirror the other. A gap exists between them, an echo of the larger               gap between the fingers and the thumb. In this positioning of her               hands and their placement on her lap, Desbordes-Valmore appears               to interrupt the standard portrait. It is as if her hand appears,               perhaps unconsciously, not only to point out difference suppressed               by the format, but to point to the area of sexual difference, making               a motion of splitting, or separation.<sup>16</sup></p>			<p class="second"> Generally, the women in this grouping were older 			  and the emphasis was on character and physiognomy-which was to reveal 			  their &quot;moral intelligence.&quot; This physiognomic investigation 			  is evidenced by the focus on the lines and forms of Desbordes-Valmore's 			  face, the bags that form under her eyes, the wrinkles that enframe 			  her mouth.<sup>17</sup> The saccharine quality of her facial expressions combined 			  with the awkward tilt of her head would inspire Barthes to write 			  that &quot;Marceline Desbordes-Valmore reproduces in her face the 			  slightly stupid virtues of her verses.&quot;<sup>18</sup></p>			<p class="second">What characterized the second grouping of women,               however, was not so much the attention to facial expressions, but               the attention to their bodies. Although the body was hidden beneath               heavy folds of fabric, such as linen or velvet, or heavy dresses               and bonnets, the subject was still read first as a body. Young women,               generally of the theater, such as Sarah Bernhardt, or models, were               often depicted draped in heavy fabrics that they subtly clutched               to their breasts or lay over their shoulder.<sup>19</sup> In contrast               to the straight, simple lines of the dark suits worn by the men,               the bolts of fabric formed deep dramatic folds. Although the drapery               provided coverage equal to the bourgeois dress that the older female               artists wore, the drapery is a constant reminder of the nude body               underneath, the interior precariously covered. This drapery was               the opposite of &quot;the costume of the bourgeois anonymity&quot;               that the male artists adopted &quot;to <i>reveal</i> themselves,&quot;               for while the black suits recalled the exterior world, the world               of the modern city, the drapery consciously invoked history and               interiority: interior settings, such as the studio or even, in the               two photographs of Bernhardt, the bedroom, and the interiority of               the nude body beneath the clothing. The vacillation between these               two conditions-that of interiority and exteriority-can be said to               structure these portraits. In addition, it is impossible to view               the drapery without thinking of class-the difference that marks               the subjects of this grouping as different from the everyday clothing-the               bourgeois clothing read as natural-worn by the artists, both male               and female.</p>			<table width="114" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="194">              <tr>                 <td><a href="farrell_3.html"><img src="gr/farrellimages/dore.jpg" width="130" height="160" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"> Nadar, Gustave Dor&eacute;                   </div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Although Nadar also utilized drapery as ornament               in his representation of male artists, such as Gustave Dor&eacute;               (1856-58) or Jean Journet (ca. 1855-56), that drapery played a fundamentally               different role in the portraits of male subjects. In the portraits               of Dor&eacute;, the elaborately arranged drapery rests on top of               the bourgeois black suit, to be read as an individual artistic flourish               literally added to the staid, respectable bourgeois uniform. While               in the portraits of Journet, the drapery framed his body, like that               of a martyr. As Elizabeth Anne McCauley writes</p>			<blockquote> 			  <p class="second">The use of a velvet mantle flowing around a nude 				torso, adding mass and visual richness, was less a derivation 				of high fashion than a borrowing of the baroque symbolism of genius 				and power. By removing the figure from contemporary life, this 				framing device focused attention on the face and encouraged comparisons 				with Bernini's bust of Louis XIV or a Roman portrait bust, in 				which a specific likeness contrasts with generalized, dynamic 				drapery....<sup>20</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second">At least three of Nadar's photographs of Bernhardt               produced between 1864 and 1865 showed Bernhardt covered in heavy               fabric, leaning on a pillar in poses and compositions so similar               that one could mistake several photographs for multiple exposures               shot at the same session. On closer inspection, differences emerge:               the color of the drapery, the position of Bernhardt's form, her               slightly differing facial expressions and the lighting of the scene.               Nadar's photographs of Bernhardt were markedly different, distinguishing               this series from both Bernhadt's representation in the work of other               photographers and Nadar's other subjects. In the photographs, Bernhardt               was shown immersed in voluminous drapery in Nadar's standard three-quarter               body view. She leans on a truncated column, dramatically draped               in either light or very dark colored drapery, which forms thick               folds and creases around her body. The loose, undulating form of               the drapery is echoed in her free flowing hair that curls around               her face, highlighting her facial features, the focus of the work.               The lighting, which produces gentle gradations of shadow and light               and the smooth, glossy surface creates an overall effect of luminosity               and polish and allows fine details-such as the texture of the cloth,               the tasseled details at the borders, the metal of her earrings and               the gloss on her lips- to be revealed. The goal of the photograph               was not only to portray her dramatic, daring spirit, but to show               that this artistic soul can be most fully and accurately portrayed,               indeed can only be portrayed, through a fellow artist, Nadar.</p>			<table width="51" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="142">              <tr>                 <td><img src="gr/farrellimages/bernhardt_small.jpg" width="100" height="123" alt="Sarah Bernhardt"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"> Nadar, Sarah Bernhardt, ca.                     1864.

Although drapery was used with               other women and some men, it is at its most voluminous, most conspicuous               in the portraits of Bernhardt. It is also integral to the meaning               of the photographs as it is in the multitude of voluminous folds               that the meaning of the works reside. The works can be said to be               like the folds, to be between layers in which questions of gender,               social class, art reside. The folds encompass layers of fabric,               between which fall deep shadows, paralleling the world of betweens               in which Nadar and his milieu operated. The folds that were most               prominent in Bernhardt's drapery, significant as the fold can be               associated not only with her portrait, but with Bernhardt, who,               as a woman, transgressed the typical gendered role for women and               operated in a zone of the fold, between artist and muse, between               bourgeois and bohemian, between the male artists and that of the               sexualized and/or maternal body. Her portrayal, with the thick,               almost sculptural folds of fabric, the classical pose leaning on               a columned pillar consciously recall poses associated with the history               of art, although Nadar himself was a firm proponent of modernity,               deriding painters such as Jean Auguste Dominque Ingres for the stale and               sterile quality of their work with its emphasis on line and classical               composition.</p>			<p class="second">Yet the drapery and props cast Bernhardt more as               a muse or model than as a fellow artist. Compared with Gustave Courbet's               <i>Studio of A Painter: A Real Allegory Summarizing My Seven Years               of Life as an Artist</i>, (1854-5), Bernhardt occupies a position               similar to the female model located in the center of the painting.               The woman in the painting stands behind the artist (Courbet), a               figure of silent support with a look of dreamy intent while watching               the artist paint a landscape. She is nude except for a white cloth               she holds to her body, which does not so much cover her as emphasize               her nudity. Her nudity is further reinforced by the crumpled pink               and white pile formed by her dress that lies on the floor in front               of her. The woman's role in the work is ambiguous - she may be a               muse, or divine inspiration, or a model for another work. Like the               landscape he is painting, the woman represents a standard artistic               convention-the nude-that evokes high art. She also can be read as               symbolizing nature, her purity and innocence emphasized by her association               with the boy, the dog and the landscape being painted. Her &quot;naturalism&quot;               is reinforced by her nudity - she does not adopt the clothing (or               artifice) of the bourgeoisie or the Parisian artists gathered around               the back of the canvas, rather, she stands, in a &quot;pure&quot;               state, looking over the artist's shoulder in support of his genius               and the culture he symbolizes. </p>			<table width="165" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="220">              <tr>                 <td><a href="farrell_5.html"><img src="gr/farrellimages/maria.jpg" width="180" height="235" alt="Maria: Click for Larger Image" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"> Maria, 1856-9 .</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">To say that Nadar presents Bernhardt as representing               &quot;Nature,&quot; would be incorrect, but it is important to note               how different her representation is from the male artists and how               much closer the resemblance is to Courbet's nude model or 'muse,'               and Nadar's portraits of the model Maria. Nadar's portraits of Bernhardt               also differ significantly from how she was portrayed by other photographers.               Comparing an 1877 woodbury portrait of Bernhardt by Emile Tourtin               with Nadar&#146;s images, one notices in both series a concerted               focus on material, yet the elaborate volumes of Nadar&#146;s drapery               are replaced in Tourtin by elegant lace, pearls and jewels. Bernhardt's               elaborately flounced white dress, composed of layers of ruffles,               laces, pleats and folds and buttons, thick ropes of pearls dangling               from her arms, her ears and around her neck over a rhinestone choker,               and the large white flower in her hair portray not just a different               image, but a different type of person than in Nadar's images. In               Nadar's photographs, Bernhardt, though shaded, appears more in focus               and physically closer to the viewer by appearing to lean into the               camera, while in Tourtin's image she appears hazy and out of focus,               as if weighed down by the layers of artifice that connote a specific               class. In the Tourtin, Bernhardt lacks a connection with the viewer               (and by association with the photographer), rather she turns her               head at a three-quarter angle, hiding half of her face and focusing               her gaze to the side, out of the range of the camera. In such a               work, what one sees is more an official portrait than a collaboration,               for in Tourtin's image, she is Sarah Bernhardt, the celebrated actress,               more a personality, a successful performer off-duty than an artist.               In such a work, the emphasis is on the external, whereas Nadar attempts               to strip her image of artifice in an attempt to reach the internal,               the core, of her as an artist, and as a woman, by association, the               unknowable &quot;other.&quot;</p>			<p class="second">The dialogue between interiority and exteriority               as projected onto the female body culminates with the two photographs               of <i>Maria</i> (1856-9) and <i>Paul Nadar and his Nurse</i>, 1856.               Little is known about the model from Antilles named Maria. In the               first photograph, Maria is presented with her body and face turned               away from the camera, a large portion of her face hidden in shadow.               Her hands are tightly clasped around the drapery to form a closure,               while her arms are crossed against her front as a double barrier,               dramatic, opalescent light which shines on her arms creating a visual               distraction, a diagonal that not only blocks the gaze from her front               but leads the eye to her shoulder and the backdrop. In contrast,               the other photograph is more about exposure. Strongly lit, Maria               faces forward, her arm rests on the back of the chair and her hand               is on her cheek, drawing attention to her face which is turned at               a slight angle and her gaze off-camera. The drapery falls open,               exposing her breasts, which are only slightly lower than the center               of the photograph. The two works emphasize the effects of uncovering               and revealing, and the fine line that exists between the nude body               swathed in drapery and the body exposed when the drapery falls away.</p>			<p class="second">The body exposed, or the interior rupturing the               fa&ccedil;ade of the exterior also can be seen in the photograph               of Nadar's son, Paul, being fed by his wet nurse (<i>Paul Nadar               and his Nurse</i>, 1856). The bodies of the nurse and the baby are               almost entirely covered by cloth-white bonnets cover their heads               and are tied securely below their chins, the baby is covered in               layers of fabrics and blankets held by the nurse who wears a black               lace shawl overtop of her black dress which primly extends to the               her neck in a white lace collar. Yet despite the excessive covering,               the body emerges in the form of the woman's naked breast, firmly               clenched by her darker skinned hands that she offers to the child               for a feeding. This action creates an opening, a disruption in the               layers of fabric, and the emergence of what is normally hidden and               contained, representative of the interior and the private, becomes               exposed, public, and viewed. This exposure also reveals what ultimately               codes her, not only in terms of gender and sexuality, but also racially               and socio-economically-it reveals her position in Nadar's world.</p>			<p class="second">The last category of female portraiture is reserved               for only one person-Nadar's wife, Ernestine. In these works, the               subject cannot be reduced to distinctions of artist, client, or               model, as she transcends such categories. Instead,her portraits               are characterized by intense intimacy between the subject and the               photographer. Ernestine does not utilize studio props or costumes,               in fact, she appears to have an active resistance to the camera               and to posing. In the first photograph, <i>Ernestine</i>, (1854-5)               she is very young and either newly married or engaged to Nadar.               Here, she is portrayed as representing the bourgeois values so antithetical               to his bohemian image and lifestyle, yet the camera oddly seems               to take her side. As described by Maria Morris Hambourg, she is               &quot;...Shrewd and cautious, this young woman knows and distrusts               the man with the camera. Attempting to deflect Nadar's effect upon               her, she crosses her arms protectively and with narrowed eyes and               firm jaw resolutely meets his challenge.&quot;<sup>21</sup> Dressed               in a proper bourgeois dress, the dark, somber material is interrupted               by touches of white on the edges of her sleeves, the white decoration               on her chest and the lace collar framing her face. She sits forward               in her chair, her body and face turned at a slight angle to the               camera, thus disrupting its view. She does not appear to pose, rather               her body appears to brace itself against the camera, an impression               reinforced by the tenseness of her lips and the narrowing of her               eyes. Unlike his other subjects, both male and female, she seems               rather bored, even hostile to the whole process. </p>			<p class="second">Ernestine is portrayed again around 1890. By now,               Ernestine is in weaker health; she has aged and is confined to the               home because of a partial paralysis. In this image, what is striking               is not her physical condition but the beauty and the intense tenderness               that are depicted. The photograph is composed of severe contrasts               between darkness and light, the darkness of the shadows and drapery               played against the softness of her white flowing hair, her pale               aged skin and the white lace blouse that emerges from under the               fabric. She gently holds a bouquet of violets to her lips, a pose               reminiscent of Edouard Manet's painting <i>The Street Singer</i>               of 1862. The focus is on her face, not to convey &quot;moral intelligence&quot;               or dramatic virtues, but to show the intense bond of profound generosity,               trust and love that exists between photographer and subject. While               Nadar's other portraits are characterized by their public nature,               the emphasis on performance, presentation, and theatricality, the               portraits of Ernestine are marked by their simplicity, their subtlety,               their utter lack of artifice. Whereas the other portraits appear               to be caught in a fold, the area between exterior and interior,               between exposure and concealment, the portraits of Ernestine represent               the ultimate interiority.</p>			<p class="second">The three divisions that I have utilized for this 			  paper are, of course, not exact. Rather, what I wanted to show was 			  that Nadar's portraiture of women reveals a myriad of attitudes 			  concerning gender, representation, public and artistic life in mid-to 			  late-19th century Paris. Much like his earlier photographs of the 			  mime, Pierrot, who illustrates various emotions and actions, Nadar's 			  portraits of women illustrate that gender is also a construction, 			  one which is artificial, neither constant nor consistent, and can 			  be adopted and imposed. This construction can be read as reflected 			  in Nadar's portrait photography, as the photographs themselves are 			  capable of revealing such a construction through the folds, the 			  betweens, which transcends the subject to create an additional meaning. 			  As Pollock has written </p>			<blockquote>			  <p class="second"> Indeed, woman is just a sign, a fiction, a confection 				of meanings and fantasies. Femininity is not the natural condition 				of female persons. It is a historically variable ideological construction 				of meanings for a sign W*O*M*A*N which is produced by and for 				another social group which derives its identity and imagined superiority 				by manufacturing the spectre of this fantastic Other, WOMAN is 				both an idol and nothing but a word.<sup>22</sup></p>			</blockquote>			<p class="second"><a href="farrel_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a> 			<p><font class="second"><a href="farrel_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> 			  <br>			  &nbsp; 		  </td>          <td width="10">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a> 	  </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Jennifer Farrell.
