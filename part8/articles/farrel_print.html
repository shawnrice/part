Paul Getty Museum, Malibu.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second"> &quot;Nadar&quot; was the name offered by Roland Barthes         to his own question as to who was the world's greatest photographers<sup>1</sup>.         The question runs beneath an image he claimed was &quot;one of the loveliest         photographs in the world&#133;a supererogatory photograph which contained         more that what the technical being of photography can reasonably offer.&quot;<sup>2</sup>         The image is of a white haired woman with soft dark eyes, who through         dark velvet folds, lifts a hand obscured by an cream colored eyelet- edged         sleeve to gently raise a sprig of violets to her mouth in a gesture so         tender, so private, it resembles more the action of a kiss or a breath         than a posed portrait. In the text, Barthes identified the photograph         as being &quot;of his [Nadar's] mother (or of his wife-no one knows for         certain).&quot;<sup>3</sup> This ambiguity allowed Barthes to view the         image through his own bereavement-the death of his mother-the event that         propelled him to search for the ontology of photography, a medium he declared         to be structured by loss. That Barthes included a portrait by Nadar in         a book on photography is hardly surprising, as Nadar has generally been         considered one of the premier portraitists since the time he opened his         studio. It is also not surprising that Barthes would chose to project         his own longing onto this image, creating a narrative suited to his own         purpose as the book is a personal meditation on photography, structured         by preferences, or as he claimed &quot;I like / I don't like.&quot;<sup>4</sup>         The photograph that inspired Barthes is markedly different from the images         most often associated with Nadar, both in subject, relation and time.<sup>5</sup></p>      <p class="second">Celebrated during his lifetime as one of the greatest         photographic portraitists, Gaspard F&eacute;lix Tournachon, known as Nadar         received particular renown for his informal photographic and caricature         archive of the cultural generated by his photographic portraits of celebrated         subjects, players of the mid to late Nineteenth century Paris--&quot;la         vie boh&eacute;me&quot;-the world in which he portrayed himself as belonging.         Despite the acclaim the primary benefit was financial, as the majority         of his photographs were cartes des visites commissioned because of his         fame. It was through these quotidian photographs that he was able to support         himself and fund his other projects. </p>      <p class="second">Nadar stated that the goal of the photographer was to         capture the &quot;moral intelligence of your subject - that rapid tact         which puts you in communion with your model...and which permits you to         give ...the most familiar and favorable resemblance, the intimate resemblance.&quot;<sup>6</sup>         His collodion-on-glass negative photographic portraits contained detailed         views; figures seated or standing in three-quarter body shots against         neutral backdrops. Like other portrait photographers, Nadar utilized props         and costumes, such as drapery, in his photography, yet as opposed to other         contemporary portraitists, such as Andr&eacute; Adolphe Eug&egrave;ne         Disd&eacute;ri (credited as the inventor of the <i>carte de visite</i>),         Nadar's photographs transmited their information through a minimum of         sources. Attention was directed to the subjects through the simplicity         of the set; instead of employing elaborate backdrops, his subjects were         generally seated, facing the camera either frontally or at a three-quarter         view. Lighting was both natural and artificial, directed through the use         of mirrors to create dramatic shadows, contrasting light tones against         dark to enframe his subjects in an aura of light, intended to mirror their         personal aura. This luminosity made subjects appear aglow, as if lit from         within, an effect amplified by the intense smoothness of the pictorial         surface.</p>      <p class="second">While the props were minimal, the surfaces were detailed,         drawing attention to the intensity of textural details. The use of props         may contain clues to gender roles and identities, roles that may have         been emphasized or dramatized for the camera in a type of studio performance.         The photographs have an aura of naturalism. The subjects were generally         shown in clothing instead of costumes, which had the effect of amplifying         this effect. The clothing was chosen over costumes so as to direct attention         to the character of the subjects, as constructed through clothing, poses         and facial expressions, versus the theatrical distraction of costumes.         More than anything else, what has been said to characterize Nadar's portraits         was his apparent rapport with his subjects, so as to appear more as collaboration         than as a relationship between client and businessman or subject and operator.         A central question is how this relationship operates when the client or         the subject is a woman.</p>      <p class="second"> A portrait is conventionally read as a provider of information-specific         details of the subject, mainly physical, are reproduction and represented         by the artist. Because photography is an indexical art, the photographic         portrait has additional claims to veracity; it is this very claim that         leads Barthes to declare that &quot;every photograph is a certificate         of presence.&quot;<sup>7</sup> The portrait photograph typifies what Roland         Barthes describes as</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second"> ...a superimposition here: of reality and of the past.           And since this constraint exists only for Photography ...[it is] the           very essence, the <i>noeme</i> of Photography...neither Art nor Communication,           it is Reference, which is the founding order of Photography. The name           of Photography's <i>noeme</i> will therefore be: 'That-has-been,' or           again: the Intractable.<sup>8</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="second">According to Barthes, photography, structured by the &quot;That-has-been,&quot;         carries within it information, rather than meaning. Nadar's photographic         portraits, however, are more than mere conveyers of biographic information,         rather, they are essentially &quot;open works,&quot; where a multitude         of information resides in the betweens - in the shadows, the lighting,         the folds of the work such as Umberto Eco describes in <i>The Open Work</i>.<sup>9</sup>         Yet, in order for the photographic portrait to convey information about         the subject, it must first convey information about the world in which         the subject operates. As Max Kozloff writes in &quot;Nadar and the Republic         of Mind,&quot; </p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second"> Let's define a portrait as the picture of an individual           or group whose character is either described by social, ethnic, and           class affiliations, or may, in some measure, be invoked in contrast           to them. Sometimes, in the history of the genre, the &quot;personality&quot;           of the sitter has gained the upper hand, and, sometimes, his or her           status. More often the portrait turns out to be an unpredictable composite           image of both.<sup>10</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="second"> In Nadar's portraits of artists, male artists were generally         photographed in clothing intended to present bourgeois respectability         and modernity. Although the clothing was actually often borrowed from         Nadar's studio, it was to have the appearance of being what the subject         had worn to the studio. The same straight-forward quality which characterized         the portraits was applied to the clothing of the male subject, where nothing         was to distract from the physiognomic appearance of the subjects and their         &quot;moral intelligence&quot; of which Kozloff writes. However, with         his feminine subjects, what was emphasized was less their &quot;moral         intelligence&quot; than their physical or corporal presence. </p>      <p class="second">Kozloff writes of Nadar's &quot;republic of mind&quot;         stating that </p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second"> Nadar's republic of mind can't be said to have formed           any counterculture within the Second Empire, as if it were simply a           question of hip versus straight life-styles. On the contrary, time and           again, his artist characters present themselves in the severest terms,           the most funereal raiment. In an essay on the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery,           Frederick Brown writes: 'Black broadcloth had always been a flag of           sobriety in which Europe's bourgeoisie draped itself, not with any illusions           that clothing made the man, but, on the contrary, hoping that it would           serve to hide him.' It's a sign of their imaginative astuteness that           Nadar's sitters often seemed to have used the costume of the bourgeois           anonymity to reveal themselves. It became a foil against which they           dramatized, for posterity's benefit, a vision of their own unique and           sovereign identity. Nadar seems instinctively to have grasped this,           in defining just that moment when the face ripens into characteristic           self-assertion, toward which the body also swells.<sup>11</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="second"> Kozloff's description is revealing on several counts.         First of all, it is telling that Nadar and his bohemian subjects would         choose to adopt the bourgeois uniform. Secondly, one would assume that         Nadar's photographs specifically, Nadar's photographs of artists, were         solely of men. While men do comprise the undeniable vast majority of the         photographic portraits, particularly the portraits of artists, female         artists, such as Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Sand and Marceline Desbordes-Valmore,         were also photographed by Nadar, with Bernhardt and Sand being photographed         several times. Although these images are generally included in surveys         of Nadar's work, the critical writing about Nadar has neglected to address         the questions of gender difference, the effect of gender on the photograph,         or to clarify how gender was constructed and portrayed. For it could be         argued that Nadar's photographs not only portrayed his subjects physically         clothed as the bourgeoisie, but that his works themselves were clothed         in bourgeois conventions, expressing conventional ideas of gender and         gendered roles. Yet within this bourgeois covering were ruptures and folds,         areas of between, overlaps and divisions that revealed schisms and disruptions         within that order. It is in this area of gaps and irregularity that his         photographs appear to be uniquely suited to operate because it is through         operating in these folds that the photographs reveal gender difference         of late nineteenth century Paris bohemian and bourgeois culture.<sup>12</sup>         Through their photographic construction, Nadar's photographs can be read         as conveying the idea that gender itself is a construction, something         adopted or staged through props and accessories or something put on, like         a costume or a painted mask. Gender did play a central role in how the         women are presented, if nothing else, because they were denied the option         of the black suit of the bourgeoisie, that &quot;flag of sobriety in which         Europe's bourgeoisie draped itself,&quot; that symbol of modernity of         which Baudelaire wrote. </p>      <p class="second">&nbsp; </p>      <p class="second">As early as 1856 at the Brussels Photography exhibition         of 1856, Nadar was noticed for his 'ravishing portraits of women.'&quot;<sup>13</sup>         From the beginning of his career as a caricaturist, women artists were         represented in Nadar's oeuvre, as evidenced by the celebrated <i>Panth&eacute;eon         Nadar</i> of 1854 and 1858. In his female photographic portraits, Nadar         created a distinction between photographs of women he considered artists-celebrated         women such as Marceline Desbordes-Valmore and George Sand-who were generally         older and members of &quot;la vie bohe&egrave;me&quot; and whose portraits         he exhibited with male artists, and his photographs of young models, actresses,         dancers<sup>14</sup> that he exhibited with portraits of children and         nature studies.<sup>15</sup> A third category can be added to the other         two-photographs of his wife, Ernestine. Nadar's photographs reveal that         he adopted different modes of portraiture for each group, reflecting different         concepts of gender construction and socio-economic position, in addition         to his own relationship with the subject.</p>      <table width="106" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="212">        <tr>           <td><a href="farrell_4.html"><img src="gr/farrellimages/marceline.jpg" width="126" height="171" alt="Click for Larger Image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"> Nadar, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore,               1854.

The         frail frame of Desbordes-Valmore is shown properly attired beneath layers         of clothing: patterned scarves cover her head, a stripped bow is tied         beneath her chin in a particularly infantalizing gesture, contrasting         with the refined, dark color of her dress, whose somberness is interrupted         by flouncy white ruffs at her wrists and on her chest. Her black lace         covered hands rest on her lap, her arms bent slightly, making them pull         away from her body, as she appears to adopts the pose of male artists         also shown seated in such a position. Yet within this rather stiff and         conventional pose, the position and gesture of her hands becomes particularly         interesting. Her right hand rests on a raised leg, obscured by the heavy         fabric of her dress. Beneath the intricate black lace glove, bent fingers         appear, one flashing a gold band, the other appearing to point to her         lap. Her left hand is slightly arched, her first three fingers more visible,         almost fully extended, as the index and middle finger separate in the         form of scissors, one form appearing to mirror the other. A gap exists         between them, an echo of the larger gap between the fingers and the thumb.         In this positioning of her hands and their placement on her lap, Desbordes-Valmore         appears to interrupt the standard portrait. It is as if her hand appears,         perhaps unconsciously, not only to point out difference suppressed by         the format, but to point to the area of sexual difference, making a motion         of splitting, or separation.<sup>16</sup></p>      <p class="second"> Generally, the women in this grouping were older and         the emphasis was on character and physiognomy-which was to reveal their         &quot;moral intelligence.&quot; This physiognomic investigation is evidenced         by the focus on the lines and forms of Desbordes-Valmore's face, the bags         that form under her eyes, the wrinkles that enframe her mouth.<sup>17</sup>         The saccharine quality of her facial expressions combined with the awkward         tilt of her head would inspire Barthes to write that &quot;Marceline Desbordes-Valmore         reproduces in her face the slightly stupid virtues of her verses.&quot;<sup>18</sup></p>      <p class="second">What characterized the second grouping of women, however,         was not so much the attention to facial expressions, but the attention         to their bodies. Although the body was hidden beneath heavy folds of fabric,         such as linen or velvet, or heavy dresses and bonnets, the subject was         still read first as a body. Young women, generally of the theater, such         as Sarah Bernhardt, or models, were often depicted draped in heavy fabrics         that they subtly clutched to their breasts or lay over their shoulder.<sup>19</sup>         In contrast to the straight, simple lines of the dark suits worn by the         men, the bolts of fabric formed deep dramatic folds. Although the drapery         provided coverage equal to the bourgeois dress that the older female artists         wore, the drapery is a constant reminder of the nude body underneath,         the interior precariously covered. This drapery was the opposite of &quot;the         costume of the bourgeois anonymity&quot; that the male artists adopted         &quot;to <i>reveal</i> themselves,&quot; for while the black suits recalled         the exterior world, the world of the modern city, the drapery consciously         invoked history and interiority: interior settings, such as the studio         or even, in the two photographs of Bernhardt, the bedroom, and the interiority         of the nude body beneath the clothing. The vacillation between these two         conditions-that of interiority and exteriority-can be said to structure         these portraits. In addition, it is impossible to view the drapery without         thinking of class-the difference that marks the subjects of this grouping         as different from the everyday clothing-the bourgeois clothing read as         natural-worn by the artists, both male and female.</p>      <table width="114" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="194">        <tr>           <td><a href="farrell_3.html"><img src="gr/farrellimages/dore.jpg" width="130" height="160" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"> Nadar, Gustave Dor&eacute; </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">Although Nadar also utilized drapery as ornament in his         representation of male artists, such as Gustave Dor&eacute; (1856-58)         or Jean Journet (ca. 1855-56), that drapery played a fundamentally different         role in the portraits of male subjects. In the portraits of Dor&eacute;,         the elaborately arranged drapery rests on top of the bourgeois black suit,         to be read as an individual artistic flourish literally added to the staid,         respectable bourgeois uniform. While in the portraits of Journet, the         drapery framed his body, like that of a martyr. As Elizabeth Anne McCauley         writes</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second">The use of a velvet mantle flowing around a nude torso,           adding mass and visual richness, was less a derivation of high fashion           than a borrowing of the baroque symbolism of genius and power. By removing           the figure from contemporary life, this framing device focused attention           on the face and encouraged comparisons with Bernini's bust of Louis           XIV or a Roman portrait bust, in which a specific likeness contrasts           with generalized, dynamic drapery....<sup>20</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="second">At least three of Nadar's photographs of Bernhardt produced         between 1864 and 1865 showed Bernhardt covered in heavy fabric, leaning         on a pillar in poses and compositions so similar that one could mistake         several photographs for multiple exposures shot at the same session. On         closer inspection, differences emerge: the color of the drapery, the position         of Bernhardt's form, her slightly differing facial expressions and the         lighting of the scene. Nadar's photographs of Bernhardt were markedly         different, distinguishing this series from both Bernhadt's representation         in the work of other photographers and Nadar's other subjects. In the         photographs, Bernhardt was shown immersed in voluminous drapery in Nadar's         standard three-quarter body view. She leans on a truncated column, dramatically         draped in either light or very dark colored drapery, which forms thick         folds and creases around her body. The loose, undulating form of the drapery         is echoed in her free flowing hair that curls around her face, highlighting         her facial features, the focus of the work. The lighting, which produces         gentle gradations of shadow and light and the smooth, glossy surface creates         an overall effect of luminosity and polish and allows fine details-such         as the texture of the cloth, the tasseled details at the borders, the         metal of her earrings and the gloss on her lips- to be revealed. The goal         of the photograph was not only to portray her dramatic, daring spirit,         but to show that this artistic soul can be most fully and accurately portrayed,         indeed can only be portrayed, through a fellow artist, Nadar.</p>      <table width="51" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="142">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/farrellimages/bernhardt_small.jpg" width="100" height="123" alt="Sarah Bernhardt"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"> Nadar, Sarah Bernhardt, ca. 1864.               Modern print from a glass negative. 30 x 24 cm.

Although drapery was used with other women         and some men, it is at its most voluminous, most conspicuous in the portraits         of Bernhardt. It is also integral to the meaning of the photographs as         it is in the multitude of voluminous folds that the meaning of the works         reside. The works can be said to be like the folds, to be between layers         in which questions of gender, social class, art reside. The folds encompass         layers of fabric, between which fall deep shadows, paralleling the world         of betweens in which Nadar and his milieu operated. The folds that were         most prominent in Bernhardt's drapery, significant as the fold can be         associated not only with her portrait, but with Bernhardt, who, as a woman,         transgressed the typical gendered role for women and operated in a zone         of the fold, between artist and muse, between bourgeois and bohemian,         between the male artists and that of the sexualized and/or maternal body.         Her portrayal, with the thick, almost sculptural folds of fabric, the         classical pose leaning on a columned pillar consciously recall poses associated         with the history of art, although Nadar himself was a firm proponent of         modernity, deriding painters such as Jean Auguste Dominque Ingres for         the stale and sterile quality of their work with its emphasis on line         and classical composition.</p>      <p class="second">Yet the drapery and props cast Bernhardt more as a muse         or model than as a fellow artist. Compared with Gustave Courbet's <i>Studio         of A Painter: A Real Allegory Summarizing My Seven Years of Life as an         Artist</i>, (1854-5), Bernhardt occupies a position similar to the female         model located in the center of the painting. The woman in the painting         stands behind the artist (Courbet), a figure of silent support with a         look of dreamy intent while watching the artist paint a landscape. She         is nude except for a white cloth she holds to her body, which does not         so much cover her as emphasize her nudity. Her nudity is further reinforced         by the crumpled pink and white pile formed by her dress that lies on the         floor in front of her. The woman's role in the work is ambiguous - she         may be a muse, or divine inspiration, or a model for another work. Like         the landscape he is painting, the woman represents a standard artistic         convention-the nude-that evokes high art. She also can be read as symbolizing         nature, her purity and innocence emphasized by her association with the         boy, the dog and the landscape being painted. Her &quot;naturalism&quot;         is reinforced by her nudity - she does not adopt the clothing (or artifice)         of the bourgeoisie or the Parisian artists gathered around the back of         the canvas, rather, she stands, in a &quot;pure&quot; state, looking over         the artist's shoulder in support of his genius and the culture he symbolizes.       </p>      <table width="165" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="220">        <tr>           <td><a href="farrell_5.html"><img src="gr/farrellimages/maria.jpg" width="180" height="235" alt="Maria: Click for Larger Image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"> Maria, 1856-9 .</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">To say that Nadar presents Bernhardt as representing &quot;Nature,&quot;         would be incorrect, but it is important to note how different her representation         is from the male artists and how much closer the resemblance is to Courbet's         nude model or 'muse,' and Nadar's portraits of the model Maria. Nadar's         portraits of Bernhardt also differ significantly from how she was portrayed         by other photographers. Comparing an 1877 woodbury portrait of Bernhardt         by Emile Tourtin with Nadar&#146;s images, one notices in both series         a concerted focus on material, yet the elaborate volumes of Nadar&#146;s         drapery are replaced in Tourtin by elegant lace, pearls and jewels. Bernhardt's         elaborately flounced white dress, composed of layers of ruffles, laces,         pleats and folds and buttons, thick ropes of pearls dangling from her         arms, her ears and around her neck over a rhinestone choker, and the large         white flower in her hair portray not just a different image, but a different         type of person than in Nadar's images. In Nadar's photographs, Bernhardt,         though shaded, appears more in focus and physically closer to the viewer         by appearing to lean into the camera, while in Tourtin's image she appears         hazy and out of focus, as if weighed down by the layers of artifice that         connote a specific class. In the Tourtin, Bernhardt lacks a connection         with the viewer (and by association with the photographer), rather she         turns her head at a three-quarter angle, hiding half of her face and focusing         her gaze to the side, out of the range of the camera. In such a work,         what one sees is more an official portrait than a collaboration, for in         Tourtin's image, she is Sarah Bernhardt, the celebrated actress, more         a personality, a successful performer off-duty than an artist. In such         a work, the emphasis is on the external, whereas Nadar attempts to strip         her image of artifice in an attempt to reach the internal, the core, of         her as an artist, and as a woman, by association, the unknowable &quot;other.&quot;</p>      <p class="second">The dialogue between interiority and exteriority as projected         onto the female body culminates with the two photographs of <i>Maria</i>         (1856-9) and <i>Paul Nadar and his Nurse</i>, 1856. Little is known about         the model from Antilles named Maria. In the first photograph, Maria is         presented with her body and face turned away from the camera, a large         portion of her face hidden in shadow. Her hands are tightly clasped around         the drapery to form a closure, while her arms are crossed against her         front as a double barrier, dramatic, opalescent light which shines on         her arms creating a visual distraction, a diagonal that not only blocks         the gaze from her front but leads the eye to her shoulder and the backdrop.         In contrast, the other photograph is more about exposure. Strongly lit,         Maria faces forward, her arm rests on the back of the chair and her hand         is on her cheek, drawing attention to her face which is turned at a slight         angle and her gaze off-camera. The drapery falls open, exposing her breasts,         which are only slightly lower than the center of the photograph. The two         works emphasize the effects of uncovering and revealing, and the fine         line that exists between the nude body swathed in drapery and the body         exposed when the drapery falls away.</p>      <p class="second">The body exposed, or the interior rupturing the fa&ccedil;ade         of the exterior also can be seen in the photograph of Nadar's son, Paul,         being fed by his wet nurse (<i>Paul Nadar and his Nurse</i>, 1856). The         bodies of the nurse and the baby are almost entirely covered by cloth-white         bonnets cover their heads and are tied securely below their chins, the         baby is covered in layers of fabrics and blankets held by the nurse who         wears a black lace shawl overtop of her black dress which primly extends         to the her neck in a white lace collar. Yet despite the excessive covering,         the body emerges in the form of the woman's naked breast, firmly clenched         by her darker skinned hands that she offers to the child for a feeding.         This action creates an opening, a disruption in the layers of fabric,         and the emergence of what is normally hidden and contained, representative         of the interior and the private, becomes exposed, public, and viewed.         This exposure also reveals what ultimately codes her, not only in terms         of gender and sexuality, but also racially and socio-economically-it reveals         her position in Nadar's world.</p>      <p class="second">The last category of female portraiture is reserved for         only one person-Nadar's wife, Ernestine. In these works, the subject cannot         be reduced to distinctions of artist, client, or model, as she transcends         such categories. Instead,her portraits are characterized by intense intimacy         between the subject and the photographer. Ernestine does not utilize studio         props or costumes, in fact, she appears to have an active resistance to         the camera and to posing. In the first photograph, <i>Ernestine</i>, (1854-5)         she is very young and either newly married or engaged to Nadar. Here,         she is portrayed as representing the bourgeois values so antithetical         to his bohemian image and lifestyle, yet the camera oddly seems to take         her side. As described by Maria Morris Hambourg, she is &quot;...Shrewd         and cautious, this young woman knows and distrusts the man with the camera.         Attempting to deflect Nadar's effect upon her, she crosses her arms protectively         and with narrowed eyes and firm jaw resolutely meets his challenge.&quot;<sup>21</sup>         Dressed in a proper bourgeois dress, the dark, somber material is interrupted         by touches of white on the edges of her sleeves, the white decoration         on her chest and the lace collar framing her face. She sits forward in         her chair, her body and face turned at a slight angle to the camera, thus         disrupting its view. She does not appear to pose, rather her body appears         to brace itself against the camera, an impression reinforced by the tenseness         of her lips and the narrowing of her eyes. Unlike his other subjects,         both male and female, she seems rather bored, even hostile to the whole         process. </p>      <p class="second">Ernestine is portrayed again around 1890. By now, Ernestine         is in weaker health; she has aged and is confined to the home because         of a partial paralysis. In this image, what is striking is not her physical         condition but the beauty and the intense tenderness that are depicted.         The photograph is composed of severe contrasts between darkness and light,         the darkness of the shadows and drapery played against the softness of         her white flowing hair, her pale aged skin and the white lace blouse that         emerges from under the fabric. She gently holds a bouquet of violets to         her lips, a pose reminiscent of Edouard Manet's painting <i>The Street         Singer</i> of 1862. The focus is on her face, not to convey &quot;moral         intelligence&quot; or dramatic virtues, but to show the intense bond of         profound generosity, trust and love that exists between photographer and         subject. While Nadar's other portraits are characterized by their public         nature, the emphasis on performance, presentation, and theatricality,         the portraits of Ernestine are marked by their simplicity, their subtlety,         their utter lack of artifice. Whereas the other portraits appear to be         caught in a fold, the area between exterior and interior, between exposure         and concealment, the portraits of Ernestine represent the ultimate interiority.</p>      <p class="second">The three divisions that I have utilized for this paper         are, of course, not exact. Rather, what I wanted to show was that Nadar's         portraiture of women reveals a myriad of attitudes concerning gender,         representation, public and artistic life in mid-to late-19th century Paris.         Much like his earlier photographs of the mime, Pierrot, who illustrates         various emotions and actions, Nadar's portraits of women illustrate that         gender is also a construction, one which is artificial, neither constant         nor consistent, and can be adopted and imposed. This construction can         be read as reflected in Nadar's portrait photography, as the photographs         themselves are capable of revealing such a construction through the folds,         the betweens, which transcends the subject to create an additional meaning.         As Pollock has written </p>      <blockquote>         <p class="second"> Indeed, woman is just a sign, a fiction, a confection           of meanings and fantasies. Femininity is not the natural condition of           female persons. It is a historically variable ideological construction           of meanings for a sign W*O*M*A*N which is produced by and for another           social group which derives its identity and imagined superiority by           manufacturing the spectre of this fantastic Other, WOMAN is both an           idol and nothing but a word.<sup>22</sup><br>          &nbsp; </p>      </blockquote>  </body></html>
