It has been         established that the photographer Walker Evans was responsible for introducing         Shahn to photography.1 However, the &#147;profound difference&#148;2 embedded         in the two artists&#146; conception of photography has rarely been discussed.         Shahn and Evans never compromised their artistic visions regarding the         compatibility of art and ideology; Shahn consistently attempted to convey         his reformative social visions through his pictorial narratives, whereas,         in treating a variety of themes ranging from the documentary to formal         abstraction, Evans maintained neutral and detached attitudes toward the         subject matter of his photographs. An analysis of Shahn&#146;s two portraits         of Evans and The Dreyfus Affair, all done in 1930, and some of Evans&#146;s         photographs taken and published in 1928-30 may provide a clue to characterize         their different approaches to art.<br>        <br>        Shahn, a Russian-Jewish immigrant whose father was a woodcarver and active         socialist, became aware of the corruption interwoven into the fabric of         society and sympathetic toward the victims of social injustice. In adapting         to his new country, Shahn experienced new, yet no doubt familiar, forms         of anti-Semitism, &#147;more subtle than those enforced by the Russian         Czar, but no less effective in maintaining a social hierarchy.&#148;3         Although he had been making a living as a lithographer since his late         teens, Shahn prepared to be a painter.4 <br>        <br>        During his trips to Europe in the 1920s,5 Shahn, while experimenting with         the Post-Impressionst and Fauvist styles of C&eacute;zanne, Matisse, Rouault,         and Dufy, was also exposed to George Grosz&#146;s critical visual narrative.         In 1925, four years prior to his encounter with Evans, Shahn saw in Vienna         a copy of Ecce Homo (1922) by Grosz. In retrospect, Shahn revealed that         he was deeply moved by the drawing: &#147;I almost dropped dead in excitement         over it.&#148;6 He bought a copy. Within the drawings, an acid sarcasm         towards bourgeois indulgence in sexual pleasure is conveyed through lively         charged, razor-sharp lines. Its revealing content and narrative brevity         might have provided Shahn with an excellent model. Shahn, however, was         never drawn to the erotic themes that the German artist often depicted         to represent bourgeois moral perversity. Through Grosz, who began his         career as a graphic artist and whom Shahn admired as &#147;the greatest         draftsman of this century,&#148;7 Shahn perhaps confirmed his desire to         develop from a draftsman to an artist revealing social reality. After         Grosz came to New York, Shahn would visit him in 1933 and 1935 and be         given two drawings.8 Shahn enthusiastically groped for an appropriate         style to express narrative messages, yet he still had not found his own         style by the time he met Evans. <br>        <br>        Unlike Shahn, Evans was critical of the cultural pretensions of American         bourgeois society. Despite his sheltered middle-class background, he rejected         the security of bourgeois life. Even his attempt to become a photographer         seemed to be &#147;a willful act of protest against a polite society in         which young men did what was expected of them.&#148;9 In his biography,         Evans recalled &#147;My poor father, for example... decided that all I         wanted to do was to be naughty and get hold of girls through photography,         that kind of thing. He had no idea I was serious about it. And respectable,         educated people didn&#146;t. That was a world you wouldn&#146;t go into.         Of course, that made it more interesting for me, the fact that it was         perverse.&#148;10 In 1927 Evans returned to New York after spending one         year in Paris and decided to become a photographer. Like &#147;a conventional,         if well-groomed, bohemian,&#148;11 Evans toured the city taking pictures         while supporting himself through a series of temporary jobs. <br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="108" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="169">        <tr>           <td><a href="han_2.html"><img src="gr/Blind.jpg" width="132" height="175" border="0" alt="Click for Larger View"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="han_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               2:</b> Paul Strand<i>, Blind Woman</i></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">In the late 1920s, Evans was assimilated to a kind of         objective realism. The writing of Flaubert that he had avidly read in         Paris and the early photographs of Paul Strand among others inspired him         in that direction. Paul Strand&#146;s Blind Woman, 1916,(fig. 2) was a         powerful source.12 Evans was drawn to the photographer&#146;s frontal         representation of the old blind woman, which minimized the traces of the         artist&#146;s emotional response to his subject. Ultimately, realistic         content and objective authorship formed two axes of Evans&#146;s photographic         world. In an interview Evans stated: &#147;I think I incorporated Flaubert&#146;s         method almost unconsciously, but anyway I used it in two ways; both his         realism, or naturalism, and his objectivity of treatment. The non-appearance         of the author. The non-subjectivity. That is literally applicable to the         way I want to use a camera and do.&#148;13<br>        <br>      </p>      <p class="second">Within this frame of logic, Evans had access to realistic         themes of documentary photography that had specific references to American         life at a specific moment and to modernism&#146;s rational and reductive         formal structure. Throughout his career, Evans&#146;s pictures incorporate         a range of diverse themes, from the lives of ordinary people to the structural         abstraction.<br>        Evans&#146;s New York photographs of 1928 and 1929 demonstrate his double         interest in formal abstraction and the documentation of American life.         Within balanced compositions and formidable contrasts of black and white,         his pictures portray anonymous pedestrians, clerks working in shops, workers         resting on the street. One of his first published photographs, printed         in Creative Art of December 1930, shows a busy lunch counter scene in         the city.</p>      <p class="second">These various themes represent Evans&#146;s tendency toward         a neutral observation of the lives of the city&#146;s denizens. Another         group of Evans&#146;s photographs of this time demonstrates his photographic         exploration of geometric composition. These pictures focus on architectural         patterns and the spatial relationships of modern buildings. A photograph         taken in 1928 or 1929 published in Architectural Record in 1930 even recalls         Charles Sheeler&#146;s Criss-Crossed Conveyors, Ford River Rouge Plant,         1927 in its diagonally crossing composition seen from below. The Precisionist&#146;s         articulation of the precise structures underlying the machine and the         architecture may have reinforced Evans&#146;s photographic experiments         with reductive abstraction. <br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="162" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="123">        <tr>           <td><a href="han_3.html"><img src="gr/lunch.jpg" width="210" height="123" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="20">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="han_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               3:</b> One of Evan's first published photographs, printed in Creative               Art of December 1930, shows a busy lunch counter scene in the city</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">Shahn and Evans were intellectually attracted to each         other when they first met in September 1929. Just after his return from         Europe, Shahn saw Evans at the home of a mutual friend, Dr. Iago Geldston.         At Shahn&#146;s insistence,14 Evans moved into the ground-floor studio         of Shahn&#146;s apartment at 21 Bethune Street in Greenwich Village. The         Shahns lived on the two floors directly above Evans&#146;s studio and         Shahn painted in his own living room.15 As Judith Shahn, the artist&#146;s         daughter, recalled, &#147;Evans was like a member of the family; he was         frequently invited upstairs for supper in the kitchen.&#148;16 &#147;For         Evans,&#148; observed his biographer Berlinda Rathbone, &#147;no one could         have been a better ally at that moment than the energetic and canny Ben         Shahn.&#148;17 According to Bernarda Bryson Shahn, who met Shahn in 1933         and two years later became his wife, &#147;Both artists initially enjoyed         each other&#146;s witty, free-minded personalities.&#148;18 Central to         their free-mindedness was a shared subversive attitude regarding established         bourgeois society. While Evans&#146;s concern was geared more toward bourgeois         cultural prejudices, Shahn&#146;s was toward art&#146;s positive function         as ideological reformation.<br>        <br>        Shahn had been interested in photography before he met Evans and began         taking pictures in the early 1930s.19 Amongst Strand&#146;s early &#147;straight&#148;         photographs that register minute details and the subtle tonal ranges of         objects, his photographs of pedestrians especially impressed Shahn. &#147;Learning         from Strand, Shahn often turned his attention to the individual in the         urban setting,&#148; observed art historian Susan Edwards.20 Both Shahn         and Evans welcomed straight photographs to the extent that they later         discussed collaborating on a photography book in which they would oppose         both the artificiality of Pictorialist subjects such as female nude 21         and the blurry mechanism of the soft-focus Pictorialism. They rejected         romantic subject matter and idealizing techniques, but Shahn was further         drawn to the humanistic content of Strand&#146;s early photograph and         its critical potential to reveal an underside of society. <br>        <br>        In 1930, while working on the subject of The Dreyfus Affair,22 Shahn painted         two portraits of Evans. The portraits show expressive styles of Shahn&#146;s         pre-photographic period. Shahn&#146;s painterly representations of the         photographer suggest the complex nature of the two artists&#146; acquaintanceship;         for Shahn, a portrait meant the painter&#146;s critical observation of         the sitter, rather than a flattering resemblance.23<br>        <br>        On the simplest level, the two portraits show Evans sitting on a chair.         One is painted in oil(fig. 1), the other in watercolor . The canvas of         the oil portrait is thickly painted with agitated brushstrokes in bright         colors. Evans, in a dress shirt, is arrested in an action while sitting         on a wooden chair with his legs spread and holding a camera lens, an evident         marker of his profession. The broad contouring used in some parts, the         freedom of brushstrokes, and the sporadically applied blue, orange, and         dark brown recall Georges Rouault&#146;s early watercolors to which the         French painter often added pastel for heavy texture. In comparison, Shahn         shows clearer spatial order and emphasizes the fluidity of brushstrokes,         creating a more overall elegance than Rouault.<br>        <br>        Shahn divided the watercolor portrait into three transparent color-patches:         blue, covering the area of the battered wicker chair and the upper body         of Evans; white, Evans&#146;s trousers; and a light wash in pale yellow         of the surrounding area. While making each color-patch into a concrete         shape, the calligraphic and elliptical contours and linear details added         later not only give the patches vibrating rhythms, but also enliven the         freshness of each color without reducing the color to a function of simple         representation. Within this overall scheme, the torso of Evans is barely         distinguished by the few flowing lines from the chair in which he is slouching.         His shoulders are hunched and his hands are digging into his pockets.         The transparent colors and calligraphic linear details are associated         with Raoul Dufy&#146;s painting; unlike the Fauve, who depicted figures         in a more stylized manner, Shahn emphasizes the individuality of the sitter.         <br>        <br>        Within both portraits, Evans&#146;s likeness is captured through free         yet concise details. Evans&#146;s sensitive or &#147;squeamish&#148;24         personality is suggested through his physiognomy, unique pose, and neat         costume. Hardly the idealized type of portraiture, the activated brushstroke         and bodily exaggeration evoke a sense of intense psychological and intellectual         exchanges between the painter and the sitter. Neither portrait contains         any obvious iconographic sign that proves Shahn&#146;s critical apprehension         of the photographer, but Shahn&#146;s expressive form and color connote         the essential difference embedded in their art; at this time Shahn chose         to reject formalist-modernism in favor of a more realistic representation         conveying concrete narrative contents. Shahn, who acknowledged in 1929         that &#147;the French school is not for me,&#148;25 baptized Evans with         the painterly style of the French school, colorfully characterized the         detached nature of Evans&#146;s modernist aestheticism, and covertly differentiated         the photographer from himself.<br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="96" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="123">        <tr>           <td><a href="han_4.html"><img src="gr/han3.jpg" width="156" height="200" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="20">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="han_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               4:</b> The Dreyfus Affair</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">During the summer of 1930, Shahn and Evans had a two-day         joint exhibition in the barn of a Portuguese neighbor on Cape Cod, where         they spent the summer. Shahn hung The Dreyfus Affair (fig. 4), a series         of works created specially for the exhibition and Evans exhibited his         photographs of the neighbors, the Deluze family.<br>        <br>        The Alfred Dreyfus Affair, the case of the Jewish officer in the French         Army falsely accused of treason, shook France in the 1890s. Participating         in political protests in Paris over the more recent Sacco and Vanzetti         case in America (the trial of two anarchist Italian immigrants convicted         of murder on flimsy evidence), Shahn perceived the Dreyfus case to be         a similar conspiracy of the social system against ethnic minorities and         the working class. <br>        To create The Dreyfus Affair, Shahn first used published photographic         images as models.26 From photographs in the relevant books, old magazines         and news articles, he painted the major players in the Dreyfus trial.         Fine details are added to broad washes of facial area and clothing to         characterize the faces and costume decorations. The backgrounds are left         empty or covered with a pale wash. Each portrait has the carefully lettered         name in different scripts, the hard edges of which are in sharp contrast         with the washed areas of a figure. Despite the quick application of washes,         each portrait shows proper bodily proportion, clear features, and additive         details drawn with exactness. The Dreyfus Affair demonstrates Shahn&#146;s         magnificent graphic skill attained through lithographic training. The         shaded areas of the faces suggest volume and space, yet most of the portraits         are painted flat. The optical flatness is reinforced by the impersonal         arrangement of the letters. The shallow space and fine details are possibly         transferred from the photograph, in which abrupt changes of light and         shade often cause similar flat effects. The overall transparent colors         of The Dreyfus Affair, however, do not effectively emphasize the seriousness         of the historical trial. This lightness would disappear with the emphatic         patterns--the darker tonalities, nervously broken lines, and an undercurrent         of distortion--of The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti that he began to paint         the following year.<br>        <br>        One of the Deluze photographs exemplifies Evans&#146;s photographic treatment         of the subject. The interior scene shows a prickly cactus plant set against         the framed family photographs, a souvenir American flag, and a vase of         dried flowers. Through the straight photographic technique, both photographs         keep the same degree of descriptive exactitude for the objects from the         foreground to the background. Particularly in the photograph of the cactus         plant within an airless space, the equally distinctive contours and the         scattered dark areas, in strong contrast to the white wall, push the photographed         objects all-over to the picture plane. This reductive formal process of         the photographic still life helps objectify its content, the commonplace         American domestic space. <br>        <br>        Taken slightly later, however, Hudson Street Boarding House Detail (1931-33)         shows an interior scene of a bedroom. In this bedroom picture, the decorative         quality is retained by the curvilinear patterns of the wrought-iron bed         and the black and white contrast of the bedspread and surrounding areas.         However, the shabby interior--the rough wall, the drooped curtains, and         the sunken mattress&#151;reveals an economically dire situation. Here,         the decorativeness of this photograph collides with its unavoidable suggestion         of a specific relation to the outside world; this collision of formal         abstraction and social implication makes possible multiple ways of appreciation         and interpretation of the work. In this way, Evans refused to assign a         predefined meaning to his photography.<br>        <br>        Evans&#146;s emphasis upon the absence of the author was another unacceptable         point to Shahn, who was conscious of the artist&#146;s social contribution         through critical interpretation and active involvement. In response to         Shahn&#146;s arguments about the ideological function of art, Evans said:         &#147;I wouldn&#146;t let him touch or influence me. If he said I took         Depression pictures of human havoc, and I would say that was what I was         doing, I would walk out and wouldn&#146;t let him discuss this.&#148;27         In a detached manner, Evans frequently documented subjects that contained         specific social situations throughout his career, particularly in 1935         and 1936 when he was hired by the Resettlement Administration/Farm Security         Administration.<br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="77" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="185">        <tr>           <td><a href="han_5.html"><img src="gr/han4.jpg" width="250" height="180" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="11">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="han_5.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               5:</b> Workers on Street</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="second">Despite the irreconcilable difference in their artistic         visions, Shahn would incorporate the less formalized type of Evans&#146;s         early documentary photographs into his art. These photographs often fail         to embody objective approach, as Evans himself recalled: &#147;In 1928,         &#145;29 and &#145;30 I was apt to do something I now consider romantic         and would reject.&#148;28 The oblique angle of these photographic studies         of people creates a perspectival recession that distracts the viewer from         direct visual confrontation with the photographic subject. In the late         Thirties, Shahn would use a similar diagonal composition in his own photographs         of ordinary people used for his &#147;personal realist&#148; work.29 For         instance, the subject of workers resting on the street, which Evans photographed         in 1928 or 1929 (fig. 5), is echoed in Shahn&#146;s photograph, Sunday,         1937, and the same subject is again transformed into the painting, W.P.A.         Sunday, 1939.<br>        <br>        By the early 1930s, Shahn must have fully appreciated Evans&#146;s ambivalent         attitudes toward the variety of photographic themes. Despite the evident         differences in their early careers, Evans&#146;s extensive experimentation         with photography offered an immediate and ample environment in which Shahn         became aware of the usefulness of photography for the representation of         realistic visual drama. Whereas Evans attempted to privilege photography         as a fine-art medium capable of embodying diverse formal and thematic         tendencies, Shahn integrated photographic images and details into his         painting to convey historically specific and ideologically critical narratives.         The portraits of Evans painted by Shahn at the moment of their stylistic         breakthrough suggest intimate, intense and critical dialogues between         the two young artists.</p>      <p class="second"><a href="han_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a> </p>      <p><font class="second"><a href="han_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>         <br>        &nbsp;     </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
