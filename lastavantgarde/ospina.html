A &#8220;hydrospatial city,&#8221;               to be exact, in which a sustainable community of mobile habitats               would hover, suspended 3200 to 5000 feet above the earth. The concept               was made public through a series of mixed media exhibitions from               1975 to 1982, bringing together for the first time the material               elements of Kosice&#8217;s vision. A project comprising diagrammatic               drawings, sculptures, reliefs, maquettes, photo-collages and manipulated               photographs, and theoretical texts, the <em>Hydrospatial City</em>               is, in the most general sense, an unapologetic contribution to the               utopian quest for the development of an urban environment suitable               for a &#8220;new civilization.&#8221; By &#8220;free[ing] human               beings from each and every tie&#8221;[3] of modern living, the <em>Hydrospatial               City</em> offers its residents the opportunity to revolutionize               the experience of their domestic environments and quotidian rituals.</p>            <p>My paper explores the ways in which the material and textual components               of the <em>Hydrospatial City</em> provide a means of recuperating               the potential residing within the concept of utopia. This restoration,               I propose, relies on a shift from an investigation based solely               on ideology and socio-political viability&#8212;arenas in which               it is not difficult to locate areas of deficiency and outright omission               in Kosice&#8217;s project&#8212;to one in which the structural or               formal constructs of utopian vision and their aesthetic function               are emphasized. Drawing upon Gaston Bachelard&#8217;s <em>The Poetics               of Space</em>, I offer that it is via a reconsideration of the role               and experience of the domicile that the <em>Hydrospatial City</em>               reveals the specific nature of its relationship to one form of utopian               speculation.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p> [1] I am borrowing this translation from Gabriel P&eacute;rez-Barriero               in &#8220;The Negation of All Melancholy: Arte Mad&iacute;/Concreto-Invenci&oacute;n               1944-1950, ed., David Elliott, <em>Art from Argentina 1920-1944</em>,               Oxford: The Museum of Modern Art Oxford, 1994, 60.<br>              [2] Ibid., 59-60.<br>              [3] Gyula Kosice, &#8220;Hydrospatial City Manifesto,&#8221; in               Rafael Squirru, <em>Kosice</em>, Buenos Aires: Ediciones de Arte               Gaglianone, 1990, p.117.</p>            <p></p></td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
