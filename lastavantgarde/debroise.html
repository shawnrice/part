I had then               taken the salutary decision to move my fieldwork site from my native               Morocco to search and probe family resemblances at work in another,               so-called alternative modernity. Alberto, well aware of my anxiety               over dominant geopolitical determinations, my inability to welcome               contemporary peripheral nationalisms as viable counter-narratives               of modernity, and mixed-feelings towards the aesthetics and erotics,               the libidinal economies, of cross-cultural encounters mediated through               peripheral national cultures, was determined&#8212;not without a               sense of affectionate pride and complicity&#8212; to update me coute               que coute via overwhelming reading suggestions. At that stage of               our disciplinary training, still able to maintain a distance from               the well-oiled machine of academic anthropology in the United States,               a book was simply a curio-site, a prosthetic affective landscape,               and a weapon to deflect and temper nativist and culturalist claims               one inexorably encounters during fieldwork. I had some money from               a small travel grant, so I indulged gluttonously. Among the books               I would come across were Olivier Debroise&#8217;s.</p>            <p>One may dwell on and resist the distinction between the &#8216;ordinary&#8217;               and the &#8216;exceptional&#8217; but this would be a vain exercise               to frame the singular and ungovernable life (alas, painfully too               short) of Olivier Debroise: art historian, filmmaker, writer, curator,               fellow traveler and foreign body in peripheral cultures of nationalism,               and friend who took anthropology&#8217;s modernist concept of going               native to an extreme form during the three intellectually prolific               and intense decades he spent in Mexico, blurring through his innovative               curatorial practice the very distinctions of strange and the familiar,               native and foreigner, home and faraway places. Olivier belonged               to that exceptional lineage of cosmopolitan modernists and avant-gardists&#8212;artists,               filmmakers, writers and intellectuals whose work he would nonetheless               passionately disarticulate&#8212;who have crisscrossed the political,               affective and aesthetic landscapes of peripheral modernities: Einsenstein               in Mexico, Jean Genet in Morocco, Duchamp in Buenos Aires, Maya               Deren in Haiti, Miguel Covarrubias in Bali to name only the most               prominent ones and the ones with whom he would no doubt feel elective               affinities with.</p>            <p>Why exceptional, and not ordinary? Because these eventful geographic               displacements troubled and intoxicated both sides of the travel,               and indeed Olivier&#8217;s multi-polar geopolitical and affective               crossings do not lend themselves to easy categorization. Not only               do they enact a singular blurring of North-South, South-North, North-North,               South-South characteristic of the sentimental and aesthetic peripatetic               journeys of cosmopolitan modernists and avant-gardists escaping               to faraway places to seek something more than mere exotic re-enchantment,               Olivier&#8217;s crossings (geographically and through his curatorial               vision, art historical research and writings as an experimental               novelist and filmmaker), can be seen as a patient and passionate               weaving of a connective tissue across peripheral modernities and               the construction of a curatorial dispositif understood as a counter-narrative               to both nationalist and neo-colonial forms of domination.</p>            <p>But Olivier&#8217;s three decade detour through Mexico (whether               that exceptional detour would become permanent is a question I would               always pose to him but would always be met with vague answers) exceeds               the economy of departure and arrival characteristic of the ethnographer&#8217;s               vocation of conducting short or long-term fieldwork (whether at               home or abroad) with the aim of ultimately carving a reflective               space upon removal from one&#8217;s site of research. Olivier&#8217;s               intervention privileged permanent becoming over the geopolitical               and academic privilege afforded by ethnographers who rely on reflexivity               after the fact: he was always in the midst of things, a unique non-academic               ethnographer not unlike the Mexican cosmopolitan modernist, visual               artist and amateur anthropologist Miguel Covarrubias he so admired.               And although not an ethnographer by training, Olivier can be considered               to have mined institutional and official anthropology of post-revolutionary               Mexico. As anthropologist Guillermo De la Pena remarks in his perceptive               essay &#8216;Nacionales y Extranjeros en la historia de la antropologia               Mexicana&#8217;:</p>            <blockquote>              <p>There is a fundamental difference between foreign anthropologists                 and Mexican anthropologists. Foreign anthropologists defined and                 frame their work in purely academic terms, whereas their Mexican                 colleagues tend to view anthropology in political terms, and not                 only for ideological reasons.</p>            </blockquote>            <p>A &#8216;Mexican&#8217; ethnographer of sorts, Olivier was committed               to politicizing present-day traces of the constitutive assemblage               of Mexican post-revolutionary modernity: the link between Mexican               nationalist anthropology, the aesthetics of the historical vanguardia,               and the non-academic ethos of contemporary art. Olivier belonged               to that generation that saw in contemporary art practice the hope               to invent a non-academic form of critique, even if his own academic               research was conducted with a great deal of rigor, surgical precision               and innovation. Olivier managed to initiate liminal spaces between               academic and non-academic forms of interventions.</p>            <p>This gesture is particularly visible in his film Un Banquete in               Tetlapayac, a film I consider, from the standpoint of mining Mexican               nationalist anthropology&#8217;s fascination with a &#8216;deep               Mexico, Mexico profundo&#8217;, to be the most important film experiment               since Ruben Gamez&#8217;s irreverent piece &#8216;La Formula Secreta&#8217;               (1965). A Banquet in Tetlapayac (2000) ought perhaps to be approached               as nothing less and nothing more than a disarticulation of the connections               between avant-garde aesthetics, Mexican nationalism, and what art               historian Renato Gonzales-Mello has called &#8220;the role of Manuel               Gamio&#8217;s anthropology as a tool of social engineering.&#8217;               The film&#8217;s operates a jarring reversal of the naturalized               alliance between vanguardista aesthetics and the nationalist-ethnographic               imaginary of the 1920s and 30s in Mexico, a signature conceptual               gesture in Olivier&#8217;s work.</p>            <p>My friendship with Olivier coincided with the fact we both spent               our teenage years in Morocco (twenty years apart), where we attended               the same bourgeois Lycee Descartes, and shared a profound sense               of affinity in our engagement with Mexico: Olivier was committed               to it, I as an ethnographer passing through, intruding for a couple               of years only to return to the safety and ennui of academic life               in the United States. Olivier would remind me, time and again, of               the sense of familiarity he felt upon arrival to Mexico City in               the 1970s, and that, sensuously at least, he would feel at home               owing to the years he had spent in the cosmopolitan city of Tangiers.               It is with great regret he was unable to fulfill his wish of returning               to Tangiers next year where I had scheduled a screening of his film.               Tangiers: city of great foreigners and cosmopolitans, where Jean               Genet waited to die, Paul Bowles realized his sensuous haven, William               Burroughs sought his inter-zone, but in any event all had lived               or passed through Tangiers before or after also having spent time               in Mexico. Olivier spent a good ten years there, and sadly fell               short of returning to it. Mexico and Morocco, two national cultures               and messy peripheral modernities, enacted a strange repetition for               both Olivier and I. They both irritated and fascinated us. The space               in between these two modernities initiated a friendship between               us. In the end, I think it was, at least as far as our conversations               and friendships are concerned, neither about Mexico nor Morocco.               It was about the possibility of creating a future to come, political               and affective, through the precious gesture of linking secret geopolitical               affinities. This was the enigmatic gift of Olivier: exceptional               ethnographer and intractable foreigner meandering through a south-south               imaginary that has ceased to be an ideological horizon and has morphed               instead into a politicization of silent affinities across peripheral               modernities. It is this that makes of Olivier the exceptional intellectual               and friend I will dearly miss.</p></td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
