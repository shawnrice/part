But in the longstanding Western               philosophical tradition extending from the ancient Greeks to the               Enlightenment, aesthetic judgment is defined as an exclusively visual               process.[1] More than half a century ago, Clement Greenberg formulated               a theory of aesthetic judgment in avant-garde art based on Enlightenment               principles. His formalist framework has since narrowed the criteria               for aesthetic perception in art, leaving us bereft of the tools               to evaluate aesthetics that stimulate feeling beyond the sensation               of sight.[2] As Caroline Jones has shown in her recent book <em>Eyesight               Alone: Clement Greenberg&#8217;s Modernism and the Bureaucratization               of the Senses</em>, Greenberg conceived of the rational modernist               viewing subject in accordance with his idea of Modernism as the               evolving pursuit of aesthetic value.[3] According to Greenberg,               the modernist spirit was best expressed through the empirical exploration               of the irreducible medium, which reached its apogee with Post-painterly               Abstraction. He championed the color field paintings of Morris Louis,               who used clean, flat bands of color to perfectly articulate the               two-dimensional surface, nevertheless meeting the highest ambitions               of the Modernist program and completing the pursuit of aesthetic               advancement. As a result, late and post-modernist art criticism               has either struggled to define the aesthetics of art and its perception               within this residual framework or taken recourse to anti-aesthetic               positions.[4] Recently, however, a broadening movement among Latin               American artists explores the boundaries of aesthetic perception               by igniting our more sensuous faculties through a wide range of               media. These artists contribute to recent international currents               in sound, smell, and relational art, as well as embodied aesthetic               experience. But more importantly, their experiments with bodily               perception revive the aesthetic principles of Brazilian Neoconcretismo,               whose proponents challenged Greenberg&#8217;s visual program by               exploring modernism bodily and spatially. This paper looks at how               three key artists, Lucrecia Martel, Ernesto Neto, and Adriana Varej&atilde;o,               offer up a new sensuous aesthetics inspired by Neoconcretismo. Their               aesthetic approach extends from a cultural modernity that is peculiarly               Latin American: one that recalls baroque expressions in Latin America               to re-infuse aesthetic experience with aura and expand the limits               that Greenberg&#8217;s aesthetic modernity imposed upon reason.               With this in mind, I show how the baroque gives new valence to the               role of aesthetics in avant-garde art today.</p>            <p>Contemporary Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel plays with film&#8217;s               audio and visual modalities to prove that film aesthetics cannot               be reduced to the scopic field of the flat screen, and in fact have               the capacity to enter into and shape the spaces of bodily experience.               With her first film, <em>La Ci&eacute;naga</em>, 2001, Martel combined               minimalist images with poignant sounds that penetrate the viewer&#8217;s               space and generate powerful and unexpected sensory responses to               the film. What makes the result different from other examples of               cinematic surround sound is that Martel let sound guide the visual               and narrative components of the film by planning out the soundtrack               before she shot or even began writing the script.[5] Sound takes               precedence over the other formal elements of the medium to the extent               that it takes on a unique extradiegetic quality. Rather than retreating               into the background, sound supersedes the film&#8217;s diegetic               world and its meaning is manifest in the viewer&#8217;s sensory               environment.</p>            <p>In the opening scene of the film, sound is substantive and dimensional:               we hear the deep rumble of an approaching storm, the anxious tinkling               of ice against a glass of garish blood-red wine, grasped unreliably               by a trembling hand. Martel fixes her camera on a close-up shot               of tired bodies that lethargically drag and scrape metal lawn chairs               across the concrete. Every sound is mundane but the sharp juxtapositions               between heavy vibrations and grating noises, combined with stagnant               images and dull, dim lighting rouse a feeling of stifling, claustrophobic               uneasiness. The effect sound and image have on the viewer recalls               Donald Judd&#8217;s comment on Robert Morris&#8217;s <em>Slab</em>               (1973), when he stated that &#8220;Morris&#8217; pieces are minimal               visually, but they&#8217;re powerful spatially.&#8221;[6] But while               Morris&#8217;s obtrusive objects redefine the viewer&#8217;s surroundings[7],               Martel uses sound as a material interface between artistic form               and human body. </p>            <p>This aspect links her work to Neoconcrete experiments of the sixties,               which explored the mutual efflorescence of artwork and spectator               through the minimalist art object. Lygia Pape&#8217;s <em>Divisor</em>,               for example, involved the active participation of a large group               of children who interacted with a flexible geometric plane on the               streets of Rio de Janeiro in 1968. The children stuck their heads               through holes in a giant white sheet so that their bodies were incorporated               into the plane, and their movements both determined and were limited               by the sheet, combining the artwork and the participants as one               vital body in real, concrete space.[8] Like minimalist sculptures               of her North American counterparts, Pape&#8217;s work is realized               through viewers&#8217; contact with the object. However, while the               often imposing character of minimalist sculpture dominates the viewer&#8217;s               experience, collective interaction with Pape&#8217;s organic, skin-like               form gives rise to simultaneous realization of the work&#8217;s               meaning and both individual and collective subjectivities. Likewise,               Martel uses sound as a malleable physical medium that mediates bodily               experience without regulating subjectivity. Sound&#8217;s constant               movement and ephemeral quality destabilize the isolated image and               bring the artwork into a dialogue with the viewer&#8217;s senses.[9]</p>            <p>By expanding the nature of aesthetic reception in this way, Martel               helps revitalize the meaning of felt experience in contemporary               art practice.[10] In recent years, art critic and curator Nicolas               Bourriaud diagnosed the crisis of aesthetics in avant-garde art               after the &#8220;completion&#8221; of &#8220;the programme of modernity&#8230;[which]               has drained the criteria of aesthetic judgment we are heir to...&#8221;[11]               Bourriaud called for a &#8220;radical upheaval&#8221; of aesthetics               in light of the obsolescence of Greenberg&#8217;s formalism in avant-garde               art. His solution: relational aesthetics, which describes a vein               of contemporary art exemplified by convivial environments like Rirkrit               Tiravanija&#8217;s kitchens, in which he cooked and served Thai               curry to visitors. Relational artworks like these counter the &#8220;detached               optical contemplation&#8221; of Greenberg&#8217;s formalism with               &#8220;intersubjective encounter&#8221; as both form and mode of               engagement with the work. As Claire Bishop pointed out, Bourriaud&#8217;s               theory conflates aesthetics with the social relations that the artwork               purportedly produces.[12] However, we could also consider how the               tastes and smells of the food served by Tiravanija generate aesthetic               feeling. In a similar way, Martel&#8217;s films expand conventional               modes of aesthetic apprehension by shifting the grounds of aesthetic               experience beyond the visual and toward other sensory dimensions.[13]</p>            <p>Sensuous aesthetics in contemporary Latin American art can then               be weighed against the conventions of its Neoconcretist predecessors.               Compare, for example, the ephemeral architectural qualities of Brazilian               artist Ernesto Neto&#8217;s palpable sculptural installations with               Neoconcrete artist H&eacute;lio Oiticica&#8217;s provisional structures               of the sixties. In 2001 Neto created a stalactiform installation               of polyamide fabric legs, filled with different pungent spices such               as cumin, turmeric, and cloves for the St. Louis Art Museum&#8217;s               <em>Wonderland</em> exhibit. These enormous skin-like forms either               dripped from a net ceiling or rested on the floor in shapeless globs,               creating visual counterparts to the amorphous architecture of scents               that pervaded every corner of the museum and ebbed or flowed as               visitors moved through the galleries.[14] The way Neto&#8217;s work               redefined the museum&#8217;s interior recalls Oiticica&#8217;s architectural               enclosures called <em>Penetrables</em>. These works also required               the viewer to move around and between makeshift constructions which               he conceived not as definite structures but as manipulative models               for sensory, tactile, and spatial exploration that incorporate the               sensible body into the realization of form.[15]</p>            <p>Measuring Neto&#8217;s installation against Oiticica&#8217;s demonstrates               how the human body becomes a sensitive and responsive catalytic               presence that brings the artwork to its realization. His aesthetics               intervene in the subject&#8217;s olfactory, visual, and spatial               experiences in successive extemporaneous moments, integrating the               body and artwork in a given time and space. He uses aesthetics as               a vehicle of sensation that spawns self-awareness and concrete thinking,               which together culminate into a meaningful present experience. The               principles of embodiment and presentness distinguish the avant-garde               program of Neto and Oiticica from that of Greenberg, who couched               avant-garde aesthetics in notions of disembodiment.[16]</p>            <p>Greenberg conceived a theory of aesthetic reception in accordance               with the Enlightenment principles of reason and progress.[17] Faced               with the demise of Western civilization in a modern society shaped               by developing bourgeois capitalism and afflicted by totalitarianisms,               Greenberg offered that the avant-garde would preserve culture in               an elite, autonomous realm beyond society&#8217;s internal dynamics               and ideological conflicts.[18] For Greenberg, the avant-garde could               achieve its goals through the self-critical enterprise of painting.[19]               By late career he praised color field painting for achieving the               representation of unmodulated hues. He particularly admired Helen               Frankenthaler for trying to dissolve the paint&#8217;s texture into               the surface by flooding and staining color onto the canvas. By focusing               solely on the quality of undifferentiated flatness to procure pure               visual stimulus, color field painting confirmed the vacuity of both               painting and viewing subject and preserved art&#8217;s autonomy.[20]</p>            <p>At the time Greenberg was praising the autonomy of reason and vision,               Neoconcretismo dispensed with such abstractions and devised an aesthetic               that mediated form, materiality, and multi-sensory experience. With               her <em>Trepantes (Obra Mole)</em>,1964, Lygia Clark connected dangling               strips of rubber in the form of a M&ouml;bius strip. These organically               unified, manipulative planar surfaces established continuity between               the human subject and art object through tactile perception. Neoconcretists               believed that creating a dialogue between the subject&#8217;s bodily               senses and the art object&#8217;s physical nature would open a space               for expression and test the limits of Greenberg&#8217;s rational               disembodied subject.[21]</p>            <p>But does this sensuous aesthetic approach reflect a peculiarly               Latin American modernism, and why is it relevant to artists today?               Recent scholarship has shown that the protean concept of the baroque               can provide compelling post-modernist contexts in which we can invert               stereotypical perceptions of Latin American art as sensuous, erotic,               or irrational. It can also loosen former center/periphery models               of cultural exchange &#8211; in which Latin American art practice               operates on the margins of European culture &#8211; while still               allowing us to distinguish Neoconcretismo and its offshoots from               other international movements.[22] This approach, however, can produce               a way of thinking of the baroque as an omnipresent sensibility that               pervades generations of Latin American art.[23] Instead, we can               look at how artists and writers of the twentieth century reflected               on the Baroque culture of their colonial pasts in unique ways as               inspiration for their historically specific vanguard enterprises.               Cuba&#8217;s <em>Revista de Avance</em> group, for example, looked               to Hispanic Baroque literary culture to re-enchant modern aesthetic               experience with beauty and inventiveness.[24] Later, many of the               Neo-Baroque authors and critics, most notably Severo Sarduy, combined               concepts of the baroque with post-modernism to imagine a new Latin               American idiom based on the principle of de-centering. For other               groups ranging from the <em>Contempor&aacute;neos</em> writers in               Mexico, to Antropofagie and Udigrudi, the baroque, perceived as               the negative opposite of classical standards of beauty, served as               inspiration to subvert the values established in the European philosophical               tradition of aesthetics and to explore new ways of representing               their specific realities through the excessive, the unbalanced,               the sensual, or the melancholic.[25] In a similar way Neoconcretismo&#8217;s               multi-sensory aesthetic program eclipses that of Greenberg, who               depleted aesthetics of anything beyond instantaneous visual perception               to purify art of political content. Their approach paved a new direction               for avant-garde aesthetics, especially for contemporary artists               whose works ignite sensuous faculties to bring both aura and a new               concreteness to aesthetic experience.[26]</p>            <p>The vanguard Latin American artists and intellectuals who viewed               Hispanic Baroque culture as a moment of new explorations in art               affirmed this historical moment as the origins of Latin American               aesthetic modernity. Hungarian scholar P&aacute;l Kelemen devised               an altogether new set of aesthetic valuations for baroque art when               he began studying Latin American colonial art in the 1930s. Wishing               to separate himself from his European cultural roots after WWI,               he traveled to Latin America and researched its Baroque art as original               products of the conditions of colonialism.[27] In 1951 he published               <em>Baroque and Rococo in Latin America</em>, which addresses the               positive transformation of European imposed styles into expressions               that reflect the tastes and values of the region as well as the               individual craftsmen. For example, Kelemen especially admired the               sensitive, human-like figures made by Quito sculptor Caspicara,               which stood out for transforming the theatrical artifice of the               European Baroque into a realistic sentiment that Kelemen described               as &#8220;drama experienced.&#8221;[28] He also references a relief               carving on the lateral portal of the church of Santo Domingo in               Arequipa to highlight the Andean &#8220;mestizo style,&#8221; in               which the carver cobbled together Andean motifs and Christian iconography               to create &#8220;an expression of his own.&#8221;[29] Through Kelemen&#8217;s               analyses emerge a cohesive set of standards for evaluating the aesthetic               quality of an artwork which challenge Greenberg&#8217;s criteria.               In contrast to the values of medium-specificity, the evolution of               abstract purism, and individual expression fettered by reason, Kelemen               championed unique, heterogeneous combinations of influences that               came together on the colonial stage, and which allowed for innovation               with styles and materials, and unrestrained individual expression.[30]</p>            <p>Oiticica put these aesthetic qualities into the service of his               ambitious project to rewrite the goals of the avant-garde from the               perspective of a developing country. Oiticica&#8217;s <em>Parangol&eacute;s</em>               revolutionize aesthetic reception, turning Modernist abstract painting               into an aesthetic vehicle for extemporaneous collective expression               by channeling painting&#8217;s formal structure through samba: a               popular Brazilian dance born out of Portuguese and African cultural               miscegenation. When set in motion by a dancer, these colorful cape-like               garments transform abstract painting from a visual surface into               an active composition of form and color that is integrated in real               time and space.[31]</p>            <p>Today, artist Adriana Varej&atilde;o continues to expand the formalist               limits of painting by making painting&#8217;s aesthetics continuous               with real, felt experience. Her paintings are embodiments of the               cultural processes extending from Brazil&#8217;s Baroque history.               For <em>Azulejos como tapete en carne viva</em> she painted a grid               resembling the delicate blue-and-white tiles commonly used in colonial               Portuguese architecture. She then gauged a gaping wound in the painted               plane to expose a palpable, tangled mass of blood, guts, and gore               that appear to pulsate and ooze through the cracks of the fractured               and buckling tiles.[32] By violating the flat surface, she not only               animates the violence of colonialism but pushes painting toward               an approximation of a living, consuming physical body. The bowels               spill out from the gridded surface into the viewer&#8217;s space               where visceral intrigue and repulsion subsume visual contemplation.               This uncontained, uncontrollable element undercuts the viewer&#8217;s               movement toward aesthetic pleasure, and grounds meaning in the subject&#8217;s               natural, bodily response to the artwork&#8217;s physical presence.[33]</p>            <p>Sensuous aesthetics alter sensible experiences to heighten self-awareness               and concrete thinking. Guided by the principle of presentness and               the motive to catalyze creativity, this aesthetic program engages               international avant-garde currents such as relational art. But we               can also interpret the sensuous within a peculiar avant-garde history               that grew out of Latin America&#8217;s baroque modernity. Seen in               this light, we can distinguish sensuous aesthetics from the legacy               of Greenbergian modernism and conceive of new modes of aesthetic               appreciation directly linked to real, felt experience. Moreover,               the Baroque perspective allows us to think about art and experience               in a different historical framework, prompting us to consider new               ways of transforming both so that we can open new avenues for the               persistence of the avant-garde.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p> [1] I refer primarily to Kant, who had an important posthumous               influence on Greenberg&#8217;s theories. See Immanuel Kant, <em>The               Critique of Judgment</em>, trans. with analytical texts by James               Creed Meredith (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1986). Although Kant&#8217;s               acknowledgment of the subjective element (imagination) in aesthetic               value judgment is unique, he nevertheless emphasized the exclusively               cognitive nature of this process, which is distinct from the body&#8217;s               registering of sensuous pleasures and aversions.<br>              Also of interest on the topic of Kant&#8217;s aesthetics is the               recent article by Joseph Cannon, &#8220;The Intentionality of Judgments               of Taste in Kant&#8217;s <em>Critique of Judgment</em>,&#8221; <em>The               Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</em> vol. 66, no.1 (Winter               2008), 53-65. Cannon attempts to unpack some of Kant&#8217;s theories               on aesthetic judgment, which are essentially different from Greenberg&#8217;s.               Kant proposed that the feeling of pleasure arises through the complex,               cognitive process of reflective judgment that is brought about through               singular encounter with an object.<br>              [2] See Diarmuid Costello, &#8220;Greenberg&#8217;s Kant and the               Fate of Aesthetics in Contemporary Art Theory,&#8221; <em>The Journal               of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</em> vol. 65, no. 2 (Spring 2007),               217-228. <br>              [3] Caroline Jones, <em>Eyesight Alone: Clement Greenberg&#8217;s               Modernism and the Bureaucratization of the Senses</em> (Chicago:               University of Chicago Press, 2005).<br>              [4] See Diarmuid Costello, &#8220;Greenberg&#8217;s Kant and the               Fate of Aesthetics in Contemporary Art Theory,&#8221; The Journal               of Aesthetics and Art Criticism vol. 65, no. 2 (Spring 2007), 217-228.               Costello takes the examples of Rosalind Krauss, who has resorted               to inversions of Greenberg&#8217;s terms to evaluate art after the               1960s, and Michael Fried, who has upheld medium-specificity as a               condition of aesthetic quality. <br>              [5] Amy Taubin, &#8220;Vocational Education: Interview with Lucrecia               Martel,&#8221; <em>Artforum International</em> vol. 43, no. 8 (April               2005), 175.<br>              [6] Donald Judd as quoted in Kimberly Paice, <em>Robert Morris:               The Mind/Body Problem</em> (New York: Guggenheim Museum Publications,               1994), 106.<br>              [7] For more on the different ways minimalism articulates subjectivity,               see Susan Best, &#8220;Minimalism, Subjectivity, and Aesthetics:               Rethinking the anti-aesthetic tradition in late-modern art,&#8221;               <em>Journal of Visual Art Practice</em> vol. 5, no. 3 (2006): 127-142.               Best comments on Rosalind Krauss&#8217;s 1973 article &#8220;Sense               and Sensibility,&#8221; and Thierry de Duve&#8217;s 1983 article               &#8220;Performance Here and Now;&#8221; also Anna C.

Calinescu examines the philosophical roots and cultural               development of modernism, or more specifically, &#8220;modernism&#8221;               as the legacy of aesthetic modernity, to theorize its relationship               with the avant-garde. He identifies a conservative modernity, born               out of rationalist thought, and a romantic modernity which engendered               radical anti-bourgeois attitudes, anti-traditionalism, and the notion               of &#8220;presentness&#8221; or &#8220;being of one&#8217;s own               time.&#8221; This characteristic was also articulated by Baudelaire               with his concept of the modern aesthetic consciousness. <br>              [17] See Nancy Jachec, &#8220;Modernism, Enlightenment Values, and               Clement Greenberg,&#8221; <em>Oxford Art Journal</em> vol. 21, no.               2 (1998), 123-132; also Costello, 220-222.

Painting exemplified the Enlightenment values               of pragmatism and empiricism, yet was driven by a rationally-controlled               individualism. Early in his career Greenberg exalted Jackson Pollock&#8217;s               drip paintings as paradigmatic of Modernism: Pollock&#8217;s individual               gestures indicated an enlightened human will that was always tempered               by the practical experimentation with the medium. <br>              [20] See Clement Greenberg, &#8220;Modernist Painting,&#8221; (1960)               revised and reprinted in <em>Art &amp; Literature</em>, Lugano,               no. 4 (1965); also T.J.
