One of the paintings               exhibited for this occasion was Jos&eacute; Jara&#8217;s <em>Foundation               of Tenochtitlan</em> winner of the biennial history painting competition               in 1889. As access to the Academy&#8217;s collections was restricted,               these exhibitions were always welcomed by Mexican art critics and               intellectuals who wrote lengthy reviews explaining what they thought               should constitute the form and content of a national school during               the Porfiriato (1876-1910).[1] In his review of the 1891 exhibition               Eduardo Gibbons, for example, complained about Jara&#8217;s composition               saying that his <em>ind&iacute;genas</em> appeared to be &#8220;zulus               rather than the descendents of that pure, indigenous race, athletic               in form, as proud and valiant as the sons of Sparta. But here, in               this picture, the model is that of the conquered race, the subjugated               Indian.&#8221;[2]</p>            <p>From Gibbons's point of view it is clear that a scene with the               historical significance of The Foundation deserved a grandeur and               magnificence which Jara&#8217;s composition lacked. And that such               an image would have to be grounded in the legacy of neoclassicism,               and romanticism rather than the more realist principles that seem               to inform Jara&#8217;s interpretation.[3] As the art criticism from               the Porfiriato testifies, the artists from this period were still               very much constrained by conventions of classical beauty and the               canons established by European Academies.[4] But as European modernism               and avant-garde movements began to gain ground in Latin America,               at the beginning of the twentieth century, Mexican artists began               to move away from the conventions of academic art and traditions.               This shift coincided with the Mexican Revolution, the consolidation               of <em>mestizaje</em> and a more fruitful reconciliation with our               indigenous heritage. Whilst changes in the perception of race were               being filtered through the work of Franz Boas and cultural anthropology[5],               the challenges posed by modernism were facilitating the appropriation               of indigenous and popular traditions into the artistic practices               of post-Porfirian artists. This break from academic conventions,               and the avenues opened by artists experimenting with the use of               new media and technologies will have a profound impact in the development               of modern and contemporary art in Mexico. </p>            <p>Based on the recent exhibition &#8216;La era de la Discrepancia.               The Age of Discrepancies&#8217; held in the Museo Universitario               de Ciencias y Arte (Mexico City), and led by the curatorship of               Cuauht&eacute;moc Medina and Oliver Debroise, this paper investigates               the particularities of the neo-avant-garde in Mexico between 1968               and 1997. This was a period of consolidation through which Mexican               art was both liberated from official nationalism, and from the dominance               of Euroamerican art facilitating the creation of artistic expressions               that should no longer be considered derivative or imitative. These               groups and movements, I will argue, embody the ethos of Mexico during               a period of relative isolation from European and American influence,               presenting the complex social, cultural, and political reality of               Mexico more successfully than their post-revolutionary predecessors.</p>            <p> Following the spirit of &#8216;Inverted Utopias&#8217;[6], &#8216;La               Era de la Discrepancia&#8217; seeks to integrate Latin America&#8217;s               avant-garde into the historiography of modernism and to revaluate               the significance of these movements in the context of a particular               Latin American experience.[7] Taking as its starting point the &#8216;Movimiento               Estudiantil&#8217; of 1968 &#8216;La Era de la Discrepancia&#8217;               therefore rightly rescues from oblivion almost three decades of               neo-avant-garde production in Mexico. As the curators of the exhibition               point out this body of work has been expelled from the canon of               national art in Mexico, and has attracted little attention from               the international art world.[8] Detached from institutional patronage               and support, this production therefore presents a unique opportunity               to investigate the transformation of a neo-avant-garde aesthetic               into a form of expression that may be considered distinctively Mexican.</p>            <p>Whilst the work of post-revolutionary avant-garde artists continued               to celebrate the primeval utopia of <em>indigenismo</em>, the attention               of later generations turned towards the reality of an unstable and               politically repressive Mexico. Anti-establishment by nature, groups,               movements and artists of the neo-avant-garde followed the footsteps               of David Alfaro Siqueiros experimenting with new media and technologies               in order to express their disenchantment with a Mexican modernity               that had failed to fulfil the dreams of the Revolution. Broadly               speaking, the material covered by &#8216;La Era de la Discrepancia&#8217;               can be separated between the production of the 1970s, defined by               the militant work of experimental artists, and that of the 80s and               90s when issues of identity and gender entered the agendas of artists               working outside institutional frameworks.[9]</p>            <p>The initial discrepancy highlighted by the exhibition occurred               in 1968 when the first Salon Independiente was held. This exhibition               was summoned by a group of artists in opposition to the Exposici&oacute;n               Solar which was being organised to coincide with the Olympic games               held in Mexico city that year. Whilst their stance was a reaction               against the nationalist undertones of official patronage, the violence               and repression that the capital experienced as a result of the &#8216;Movimiento               Estudiantil&#8217; in October that year engendered a new generation               of artists committed to denounce the political and social injustices               of a failed democratic project. The exhibition then continues to               survey the production of artists marked by these events, and whose               work presented a challenge to the status of art and artists, the               role of institutions (in particular museums and official patronage),               and the canonical weight of the &#8216;Escuela Mexicana de Pintura&#8217;.             </p>            <p>In the 1980s, the attention of radical artists turned once more               to the streets of Mexico city after the 1985 earthquake had destroyed               large parts of the capital changing forever the urban landscape               of the city. The destruction and devastation felt in the capital               was accompanied by the increasing visibility of urban subcultures               appearing as result of poverty and an unprecedented urban growth.               As a result of this, popular culture begins to occupy a more significant               role in the imagery (or <em>imaginario</em>) of mexicaness &#8211;a               space once filled by the utopian appeal of its folkloric traditions.               Parallel to this, in the 80s and 90s artists began to question gender               and identity stereotypes opening a space for the exploration of               sexuality, and postmodern expressions of <em>mexicanidad</em>.[10]</p>            <p>As the exhibition comes to a close, we see how in the 1990s the               apparent economic growth experienced during the administration of               Salinas de Gortari came crashing down in 1995 after the Zapatista               rising in Chiapas, the previous year, had made apparent the ongoing               exploitation of ind&iacute;genas, and the nation&#8217;s unresolved               communion with its <em>indigenous</em> heritage. The art of the               1990s therefore continues to be influenced by political and social               agendas, but the curators emphasise the significance of independent               exhibiting and working spaces, and the role of curators in helping               to shape the direction contemporary art practices would follow.[11]</p>            <p>Whilst the material covered by the exhibition cannot but offer               an overview of artistic production at the time, leaving out some               perhaps important omissions[12], the presence of foreign artists               working in Mexico (eg. Francis Al&yuml;s and Melanie Smith), and               the contribution of Mexican artists working abroad (eg. Felipe Ehrenberg               and Martha Hellion) is rightly acknowledged and highlighted by the               curators. Hence the isolation of Mexican art at this time is only               relative compared to the artistic milieu of Mexico during the first               half of the twentieth century. </p>            <p>Although not all of the production included in the exhibition may               be regarded as neo-avant-garde, especially that of the 1990s, the               avant-garde here is defined by the experimentation and use of new               media and technologies, which does not necessarily exclude the artist&#8217;s               interest in the aesthetic qualities of his/her work. As Dietrich               Scheunemann has argued, Peter Burger&#8217;s theorisation of the               historical avant-garde as a reaction against the aestheticism of               modernism, and the artists&#8217; desire to bridge the gap between               his art and the praxis of life can no longer be sustained as a unifying               paradigm:</p>            <blockquote>              <p>The single one-dimensional &#8216;intention&#8217; of the avant-garde                 is as much one of its myths as is the related assumption of its                 &#8216;failure&#8217;. It is not in a joint strategy or political                 direction of the artists that a common ground of the avant-garde                 movements can be found, but rather in external challenges that                 fundamentally affected the production situation of the artist,                 the means of artistic production and the overall notion of art.[13]</p>            </blockquote>            <p>As Scheunemann successfully argues avant-gard and neo-avant-garde               artists were also interested in exploring the aesthetic potential               of new technologies, and it is their responses to the potentiality               of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, and new technologies               what defines the artistic nature of the avant-garde. Based on this,               claims that neo-avant-garde movements in the 60s and 70s represented               an inauthentic and anachronistic version of the historical avant-garde               would also need to be questioned, and their contribution to the               development of revolutionary art practices and techniques acknowledged.               It may be argued that it is their experimentation with the aesthetic               qualities of new technologies and media what has facilitated the               incorporation of neo-avant-garde practices into the canon of contemporary               art.</p>            <p>In his book <em>Mexican Modernity. The Avant-garde and the Technological               Revolution</em> Rub&eacute;n Gallo has made apparent the historical               avant-garde&#8217;s experimentation with the aesthetic potential               of new technologies in Mexico. Looking at the work of Mexican <em>Estridentistas</em>,               for example, Gallo describes one of Kyn-Taniya&#8217;s poem as &#8216;radiogenic&#8217;               explaining that its content reflects the &#8216;imprint of the new               technology which inspired it&#8217;[14] (in this case the radio).               Gallo&#8217;s thought provoking insights into the history of the               avant-garde in Mexico bring to the fore the potentiality of technology               to change our perception of the world, and as a consequence question               the ontology of representation, and the function of art in the modern               world.</p>            <p>Many of the explorations began by the historical avant-garde in               Mexico can be seen to inform the work of neo-avant-garde artists               working in the 1970s and 80s, except that for many artists technology               was no longer perceived as the key to unlock a utopian modernity.               Armed with cameras a young generation of filmmakers, for example,               exploited the potentiality of supper 8 as a new media that allowed               them to produce inexpensive and independent films that were &#8220;free               of censorship, and generally critical of the cultural establishment.&#8221;[15]               The radical and highly psychotropic aesthetic of Alejandro Jodorowsky               (perhaps best described as neo-surrealist) made its mark through               films and magazines; and artists exploited the power of sensationalist               media to highlight the absurdity of urban paranoias and anxieties.[16]</p>            <p>The 1970s also saw the proliferation of collective work made by               groups of artists joined by aesthetic and political agendas. Whilst               taking an active part in the radical movements of the 1970s, the               communal nature of their work also challenged notions of originality               and individuality in art. Since most of their work was produced               and exhibited in the streets of Mexico city, these groups managed               to create a public art that was more successfully integrated into               the praxis of life than that of their post-revolutionary predecessors.               Using language as its paradigm, for example, Grupo Mar&ccedil;o               explored the potential of collective work, &#8216;the relationship               between words and image, and the polyvalence of artistic meaning&#8217;.               As described in the catalogue of the exhibition in <em>Poema topografico</em>               &#8220;isolated words or poetic phrases were placed on benches,               sidewalks, light poles, and storm drains, an urban intervention               designed to generate fresh meanings.&#8221;[17] And in <em>Poema               Urbano</em> &#8220;the group passed out words to pedestrians on               the streets of downtown Mexico City, in order to have them create               a poem.&#8221;[18]</p>            <p>Throughout the 80s and 90s, the antiestablishment ideas of radical               artists were often voiced though the publication of journals and               magazines such as <em>La Regla Rota</em> and <em>Poliester. Pintura               y no pintura</em>. In spite of their short existence, these publications               were extremely important in the dissemination of ideas that were               helping to bridge the gap between neo-avant-garde and contemporary               art practices. It most be noted that this transition was accompanied               by the increasing visibility of foreign artists working in Mexico               at the end of the 1980s, and that at this point the material covered               by the exhibition becomes more cosmopolitan and &#8216;globalised&#8217;.             </p>            <p>&#8216;La Era de la discrepancia&#8217; should therefore be understood               as part of a revisionist undertaking working to dispel the view               of Latin American art as &#8216;peripheral&#8217; or &#8216;derivative&#8217;.               This revision is needed in order to acknowledge the significance               of the avant-garde in the context of Latin America, and as part               of the development and historiography of modern art. As the curators               of &#8216;Inverted Utopias&#8217; point out in the catalogue of               the exhibition, Latin American artists and theoreticians realised               that the significance of modernism resided in its ability to challenge               Old World conventions &#8220;introducing an autonomous set of cultural               and artistic values [which have allowed] the legitimation of Latin               American art and culture <em>on its own terms</em>&#8221; (my emphasis).[19]               This process of legitimation eventually liberated art from conventions               of representation giving Latin American artists an unknown freedom               to represent. What and how things were represented was therefore               no longer a matter of conventions, but of personal and aesthetic               choices made by artists as they sought more suitable forms <em>to</em>               represent the particularities of Mexico. </p>            <p>To conclude, we may argue that as new technologies and media were               integrated into the practices of modern art Mexican art was gradually               &#8216;decolonised&#8217;. The work began by the artist of the post-Revolution,               therefore, was fully realised through the production of Mexican               artists in the 70s and 80s opening the gates for contemporary artists,               such as Gabriel Orozco, whose work is now part of a transnational               and cosmopolitan art world. Neo-avant-garde art in Mexico may not               have fulfilled the utopian dreams sought by the artists of the Mexican               Renaissance but it did fulfil a utopian ideal: that of freeing Jos&eacute;               Jara&#8217;s <em>ind&iacute;genas</em> from the claws of academic               conventions. Although a society where Jara&#8217;s <em>ind&iacute;genas</em>               may be able to exist as decolonised subjects remains a dream, Mexican               artist may now more freely choose from a variety of artistic practices               and media to represent the changing reality of Mexico. </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p> [1] For a study of history paintings in the Porfiriato see for               example <em>La fabricaci&oacute;n del Estado1864-1910</em>, (exhib.cat.),               Mexico City, MUNAL, 2003; and my doctoral dissertation &#8220;Civilizing               the Prehispanic: neo-prehispanic imagery and constructions of nationhood               in Porfirian Mexico (1876-1910)&#8217;, University of the Arts,               London, 2005<br>              [2] In Ida Rodr&iacute;guez Prampolini, <em>La cr&iacute;tica de               arte en M&eacute;xico en el siglo XIX</em>, Mexico City: UNAM IIE,               1997, vol. 3, p. 353 (my translation). <br>              [3] For a study of this painting see Ester Acevedo, et.al. <em>Cat&aacute;logo               comentado del acervo del Museo Nacional de Arte</em>, Mexico City:               MUNAL, 2002, Tome I <br>              [4] See Rodr&iacute;guez Prampolini, <em>La cr&iacute;tica de arte               en M&eacute;xico</em>, and Justino Fern&aacute;ndez, <em>Est&eacute;tica               del arte mexicano: Coatlicue, El retablo de los Reyes, El hombre</em>,               Mexico City: UNAM IIE, 1990<br>              [5] See for example Agust&iacute;n Basave Ben&iacute;tez, <em>M&eacute;xico               mestizo.
