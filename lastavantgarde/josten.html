Meanwhile, German-born, Mexico City-based artist               Mathias Goeritz stood outside the Museum&#8217;s entrance, distributing               a manifesto entitled &#8220;Please, Stop!&#8221; Goeritz&#8217;s               call was a literal one, protesting the destructive movement on which               Tinguely&#8217;s work was based. In the preface to his seminal 1968               <em>Minimal Art</em>, Gregory Battcock attacked Goeritz&#8217;s               action as an isolated, &#8220;reactionary&#8221; cry for attention               that was &#8220;very much out of touch with the times&#8221;.</p>            <p>Until recently, studies of contemporary art from the 1950s and               &#8216;60s have largely been framed within national boundaries.               This has obscured the extent to which artists based in supposedly               peripheral locales, such as Mexico, actually engaged in dialogues               with artists based in art-world centers such as Paris and New York               after 1945. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by reconstructing               the artistic dialogue that was carried out from 1960 to 1962 between               Goeritz and the Paris-based Nouveaux R&eacute;alistes. By reframing               Goeritz&#8217;s writings, actions and artworks from this period               within their original contexts, I demonstrate that Goeritz&#8217;s               manifesto was not simply an isolated gesture, as Battcock asserted,               but part of a coherent theoretical program of engagement with the               international neo-avant-garde. </p>            <p>Goeritz&#8217;s manifestos and <em>Mensajes</em> (Messages) from               1960-62 constitute a critical aspect of his larger artistic project               of &#8220;emotional architecture,&#8221; a regionalist theorization               of Siegfried Giedion&#8217;s World War II-era call for a &#8220;new               monumentality&#8221; for Mexico City&#8217;s rapidly developing               urban landscape during and after the 1950s. Ultimately, monumental,               abstract, site-specific sculptures, rather than gallery spectacles,               would serve as the vehicle through which Goeritz expressed his &#8220;aesthetic               prayers,&#8221; works that lie at the nexus of post-1945 Latin American               developmentism and his dream of a generalized, modern, cosmopolitan               spirituality.</p>            </td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
