Critics quickly hailed their art as               conceptual and explained it as belonging to the latest international               avant-garde. For the most part, the young iconoclasts accepted and               even embraced the label &#8220;conceptual,&#8221; yet their work               is against internationalism, and they rarely framed their art in               terms of the avant-garde. In fact, I argue that they rejected the               avant-garde as a model for artistic production as being too elitist.               This paper examines that rejection and explains their art as the               product of an un-vanguard conception.<br>              In envisioning of a new type of art, they were influenced by the               revolutionary culture of the day in Colombia. Their intellectual               formation was marked by such revolutionary ideas as those expressed               by the Catholic priest turned Marxist guerrilla, Camilo Torres,               an important forerunner of liberation theology. These artists sought               to revise art from the roots up, aiming at enhancing communication               regarding the social and economic problems of the popular classes.               Toward this end, they created text-based works, such as Caro&#8217;s               <em>AQUINOCABEELARTE</em>, that have an immediate and intense visual               impact despite being made up primarily of words. Caro, in particular,               drew heavily from the aesthetics of popular protest, that is, from               the look of the inexpensive posters and banners, often created quickly,               that express an urgent need in order to mobilize a public to meet               that need. Caro and others proposed art making as a form of activism,               as a way to educate, to create a community, and ultimately, to shape               society in a manner consistent with grass-roots social movements.</p>            </td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
