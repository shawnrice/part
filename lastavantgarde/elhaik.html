The paper examines two recent experimental               documentary films as symptomatic returns to the avant-garde activity               of post-revolutionary Mexico: Olivier Debroise&#8217;s Banquet in               Tetlapayac (2000) and Jesser Lerner&#8217;s TSH (2004). These two               films were part of Remains of Mexico. Curator, writer and contemporary               art critic Olivier Debroise revisits the work of Sergei Eisenstein,               the elusive and enduring figure of the Soviet avant-garde. Debroise               invited 14 popular and experimental artists, filmmakers, critics               and historians to join him for a banquet at the same desert hacienda               Eisenstein stayed in, while working on his unfinished and controversial               film &quot;Que Viva Mexico!&quot; during the 1930s. Film Curator               and filmmaker Jesse Lerner reconstructs an Estridentista poem by               Luis Quintanilla. The Estridentistas were a vanguard group similar               to and influenced by the more familiar Dadaists and Futurists. Both               experimental documentaries explore the relationship between filmmaking               and historiography with a keen attention to the singularities of               the Mexican avant-garde and to processes of unearthing precious               archival material of the 1920s and 30s. These documentaries not               only continue the tradition of mobilizing filmmaking to contest               nationalist historiographies and modes of visualizing Mexican modernity,               they also question the links between the aesthetics of the historical               avant-garde, ethnography, cosmopolitan modernism of the 1920s and               1930s, and contemporary visual art practices in Mexico. In addition               to engaging these two experimental documentaries as fascinating               pieces of filmmaking and reflections on the avant-garde in Mexico               (specifically) and the historical avant-garde (in general), it also               addresses the challenges posed by these correspondences to contemporary               intersections between anthropology, film curating and contemporary               art. </p>            </td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
