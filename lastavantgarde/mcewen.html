Both a visual form and an ideological platform, abstraction               attracted a left-wing intelligentsia seeking on the one hand a non-referential               idiom, removed from the corrupt politics of dictatorship, and on               the other a more contemporary, international face to Cuban culture.               The fight for abstraction was situated within a broader social debate               that hinged on Cuba&#8217;s political futures &#8211; socialist               or democratic &#8211; and it defined, for the first time in the               avant-garde&#8217;s pursuit of this projected, modern future, a               new horizon of possibility for art as a means of social transformation.               For this generation, the ethics of abstraction demanded a commitment               no less than revolution, and the legacy of this final avant-garde               would be to push painting toward pure praxis &#8211; toward one               Modernist ideal &#8211; almost ahead of its time.</p>            <p>Using the epiphenomenon of abstraction as a paradigmatic case,               this paper explores the strategies and contingencies of the highly               self-aware avant-garde apparatus and mentality that emerged in Cuba               in the late 1950s. The last of Cuba&#8217;s three vanguardia generations,               the abstractionists occupied an improbable historical position:               they represented the final gestation of Cuba&#8217;s historical               avant-garde, with a utopian vision tied to the promise of social               revolution, yet they acted in a world defined by Cold War politics               and chastened by the failures of the European avant-garde. The international               alignments of abstraction, and the competing neo-colonial claims               on it, politicized this art from the beginning, bringing new pressures               to bear on the question of what a vanguard modernism could mean               at this time. At the center of this investigation lies a concern               to historicize both the conceptual origins of this avant-garde,               compromised by its belated historical situation, and the intense               politicization of abstraction, whose critical fortunes became a               barometer of cultural beliefs in the project of Modernism itself.</p>            </td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
