All that&#8217;s left is to bury it.</em> -- Ferreira Gullar[1]</p>            <p>On March 22 1959, on the occasion of the First Exhibition of Neoconcrete               Art in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian poet and critic Ferreira Gullar               published the &#8220;Manifesto Neoconcreto&#8221; in the pages of               the <em>Suplemento Dominical</em> of the <em>Jornal do Brasil</em>.               In the narrow sense, Gullar&#8217;s manifesto was a polemic against               Brazilian Concretism, a set of practices and theoretical positions               developed in Rio and S&atilde;o Paulo in the mid-1950s. On a broader               level, the document was a manifesto about interpretation, about               the function and generative possibility of historical re-evaluation               for the creative process of artistic production. Like Concretism,               Neoconcretism situated itself in relation to the non-objective art               of the pre-war European avant-garde. Neoconcretism, however, posed               a reinterpretation of these movements for the purposes of a newly               historicized &#8220;now.&#8221; </p>            <p>The same week as the publication of the &#8220;Manifesto Neoconcreto,&#8221;               Gullar began a new series of articles in the art page of the <em>Suplemento               Dominical</em> under the title &#8220;Etapas da arte contempor&acirc;nea,&#8221;               or &#8220;Stages of Contemporary Art&#8221;. This series, which               would continue in weekly installments until October 1960, was intended               to provide what Gullar called a new &#8220;orientation,&#8221; a               &#8220;general vision of contemporary art.&#8221;[2] As he wrote,               &#8220;Starting today, we will attempt a retrospective of the most               important innovative movements, since Cubism&#8230; in the field               of visual arts. We do not intend&#8230; an exhaustive survey, but               a&#8230;modest introduction which will facilitate comprehension               of what is being done today in the world, and in particular in Brazil.               This endeavor,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;can also be seen as a               necessity dictated by the attitude that we assume in the face of               Concrete art &#8211; and its roots &#8211; with the Manifesto Neoconcreto.&#8221;[3]</p>            <p>In the absence of any Portuguese-language textbook of modern art,               the &#8220;Etapas&#8221; had a distinct pedagogical function. As               Gullar noted when the articles were first gathered together as a               book in 1985, however, the &#8220;Etapas&#8221; were not intended               as a history of modern art, but a &#8220;revision&#8221; &#8211;               a &#8220;new reading&#8221; of the avant-garde.[4] Movements like               Surrealism and Expressionism were therefore excluded in favor of               the inexorable march of a <em>particular</em> avant-garde, an avant-garde               starting with Cubism and Futurism and continuing with Russian Movements,               Neoplasticism, Concrete and finally Neoconcrete Art. Each chapter               of this story was told in a series of episodes that unfolded week               by week within the newspaper pages, followed by a &#8220;Tentativa               de compreens&atilde;o&#8221;, or &#8220;Attempt at Comprehension&#8221;,               in which Gullar summarized and synthesized each movement&#8217;s               general trends. This &#8220;Tentativa&#8221; also functioned as               a vehicle of historiography in which theoretical arguments about               a given movement could be evaluated according to their relevance               for Neoconcrete art. Gullar&#8217;s &#8220;new&#8221; history of               the avant-garde, thus, was one of explicit linear development, its               destination, rather than its starting point, determining its path.[5]</p>            <p>In Gullar&#8217;s &#8220;new&#8221; history of the avant-garde,               the arrival at the continuous present is a logical result of decisions               taken at the forks of various aesthetic roads, decisions that forged               a singular legacy of radical, autonomous 20th century art inherited               and ultimately advanced by Brazilian Neoconcretism.[6] The vision               of art that emerges from the &#8220;Etapas,&#8221; is therefore               a process of interpretation in which fundamental concepts contained               within works of art as potential are only realized through a subsequent               process of argumentation, critique, and revision. There is a growing               sense of impatience to reach the story&#8217;s end, the moment when               historical destiny dissolves into the present, when Neoconcretism,               a historical movement having itself been just declared, is directed               towards its future rather than its past. Indeed, it is only this               last episode of Gullar&#8217;s story that is not capped with a &#8220;Tentativa               de compreens&atilde;o.&#8221; &#8220;Neoconcrete art still doesn&#8217;t               have history,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;as it is just being born.&#8221;[7]</p>            <p>In her landmark 2004 exhibition <em>Inverted Utopias: Avant-Garde               Art in Latin America</em>, Mari-Carmen Ram&iacute;rez has argued               that Latin American artists have approached the avant-garde as a               series of problems to be taken up, a strategy with clear affinities               to the position elaborated in Gullar&#8217;s &#8220;Etapas&#8221;.               In Ram&iacute;rez&#8217;s account, the teleological character of               Gullar&#8217;s story is replaced with the idea of the &#8220;constellation,&#8221;               a rhetorical figure adopted from Theodor Adorno which aims to dispense               with the linear, positivist assumptions that define the very notion               of the avant-garde.[8] Such a figure offers an elegant solution               to reductive models of delay, derivation, and copy that have plagued               the discourse of Latin American art since the formation of the national               academies in the 19th century. In favor of a center-to-periphery               model, it suggests relations that stretch in multiple directions               across time and space.</p>            <p>In these introductory remarks, however, I want to underscore the               historical backdrop against which Gullar&#8217;s ideas about history               took form, one in which new-ness, last-ness, and historical inevitability               are loaded, but necessary, terms. This historical backdrop involved               not simply a perceived inheritance of the European avant-garde,               but the politics of developmentalism and dictatorship that shaped               Brazil in the years leading up to and following Gullar&#8217;s &#8220;Etapas&#8221;               of 1959-1960. I want to call particular attention to the peculiar               resonance between the &#8220;Etapas&#8221; and a think tank called               ISEB, the Instituto Superior de Estudos Brasileiros, or Superior               Institute of Brazilian Studies, whose explicit aim was the elaboration               of an &#8220;ideology for development&#8221; suitable to Brazil.[9]               ISEB&#8217;s integrants believed that development was inevitable.               They differed, however, on how this development was to be achieved,               some calling for deregulated participation in the global economy,               others advocating an &#8220;autonomous&#8221; process of national               industrialization with foreign influence closely controlled by the               state.[10]</p>            <p>As part of these discussions, ISEB spearheaded a number of research               and pedagogical initiatives including graduate-level history classes               offered to the public. From 1954 to 1957, these history classes               were given in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education and Health               in Rio, the same building out of which the Museum of Modern Art               of Rio de Janeiro had operated since the early 1950s and the First               Exhibition of Neoconcrete Art shown in 1959. These classes were               the basis for a series of textbooks written by ISEB-affiliated authors               in the early 1960s called <em>Hist&oacute;ria Nova do Brasil</em>,               or the <em>New History of Brazil</em>.[11] These textbooks offered               a revisionist, Marxist-oriented narrative counter to official historiography,               a &#8220;new&#8221; history upon which the logic for an &#8220;autonomous&#8221;               model of Brazilian development could be based. The first five of               these textbooks were published in March 1964, less than a month               before the coup that launched Brazil into a military dictatorship               for more than 20 years. Within days of the coup, ISEB offices were               invaded and manuscripts for the remaining series confiscated. By               1965, many of the authors were imprisoned or forced into exile and               the <em>New History</em> banned.</p>            <p>In 1965, police forces also invaded Ferreira Gullar&#8217;s house,               confiscating, among other material, the collected articles of the               &#8220;Etapas de arte contempor&acirc;nea&#8221; gathered in a folder               marked &#8220;From Cubism to Neoconcrete Art.&#8221;[12] This bizarre               seizure, as Gullar would later quip, may have had to do with a confusion               between &#8220;Cubism&#8221; and &#8220;Cuba,&#8221; the <em>pol&iacute;cia               militar</em> not always being particularly bright. For our purposes,               however, it illuminates a peculiar moment in which &#8220;new&#8221;               histories of art and development crossed paths. </p>            <p>By 1961, the Neoconcrete movement had already begun to dissipate.               It was dealt a final blow when the <em>Suplemento Dominical</em>               stopped publication the same year. Gullar, Neoconcretism&#8217;s               mouthpiece, soon joined the leadership of the CPC, Centro de Cultura               Popular, or Center for Popular Culture, a leftist cultural organization               which sought to bring culture &#8220;to the people&#8221; much in               line with ideology of development promoted by ISEB. In this capacity,               Gullar&#8217;s ideas about art underwent radical revision, culminating               in the publication of &#8220;Cultura Posta em Quest&atilde;o&#8221;,               or &#8220;Culture in Question,&#8221; in 1964 just before the military               coup. This essay was intended as an explicit, polemical rupture               with the artistic vanguard and a theoretical justification of the               use of art in the ideological struggle. As he wrote, &#8220;The               Brazilian intellectual&#8230;is living at an instant of option&#8230;to               participate or not in the struggle for the economic liberation of               the country.&#8221;[13]</p>            <p>Gullar&#8217;s condemnation of non-engaged art in &#8220;Culture               in Question&#8221; came with a new alignment between art, nationalism               and the radical left. No longer was radical Brazilian art understood               as the culmination of a historical tradition initiated by the European               avant-garde. Instead, it was the product of autonomous national               production fiercely resistant to external influence. Gullar&#8217;s               renouncement of the avant-garde thus hinged on a reversal of the               historical vectors. History no longer <em>arrived</em> at Brazil,               it was to be generated <em>from</em> Brazil through a recasting               of the category of &#8220;the new.&#8221;[14] &#8220;The new,&#8221;               aligned during the time of the &#8220;Etapas&#8221; exclusively               with formal innovation, now came to describe that political, social               and economic order that would bring about a newly liberated Brazil.</p>            <p>In 1969, Gullar elaborated and refined his arguments in an essay               titled &#8220;Vanguard and Underdevelopment&#8221; introduced with               a preface by N&eacute;lson Werneck Sodr&eacute;, journalist, teacher,               integrant of ISEB and leading author of the <em>New History of Brazil</em>.               In this essay, Gullar questioned the very applicability of the avant-garde               to a place like Brazil.[15] As Sodr&eacute; wrote in his preface,               &#8220;Can there be universality in vanguardism? Is it the same               everywhere, in developed and underdeveloped countries?&#8221;[16]               For the first time in his writings on the subject, Gullar examined               the inception of the avant-garde as a <em>historical</em> phenomenon               in Europe, a phenomenon dependent on the emergence and consolidation               of the bourgeois in the wake of the French Revolution. In an account               indebted to Luk&aacute;cs, Gullar noted that the avant-garde&#8217;s               antagonistic relationship to bourgeois society was a result of its               marginalization from the very class it helped to install, its claim               for aesthetic freedom and formal autonomy an echo of the demands               for political liberty that fueled the struggle against aristocratic               rule. </p>            <p>This historical analysis, of course, begs a historical question.               If the European avant-garde was historically determined by the particularities               of its class formation, how could its structure be translated to               the economic realities of Brazil, a country whose ruling class was               built on slave labor and which in the 1960s was still in the grips               of this pre-industrial past? How could a vanguard art shock the               bourgeois when it was &#8220;imported&#8221; as the cultural capital               of this same bourgeois? How could a claim for political freedom               transform into one for formal autonomy within a country that still               struggled against neocolonial rule? How indeed, to posit a vanguard               in underdevelopment within its own terms?</p>            <p>If we follow the logic of &#8220;Vanguard and Underdevelopment&#8221;,               Gullar&#8217;s earlier &#8220;Stages of Contemporary Art&#8221;               is a case for the avant-garde&#8217;s last stand. For Gullar, the               historical framework of underdevelopment rendered the very notion               of the avant-garde inadmissible. The historic inevitability the               critic had previously ascribed to the march of advanced art from               Cubism to Neoconcretism was now a function of an economic order,               the march of an oppressed society towards liberation, its future               exhilaratingly close but just out of reach. Having finally &#8220;arrived&#8221;               in Brazil with Neoconcretism in 1959, the avant-garde became by               1969, a historical impossibility, a smoke-screen for the political               work at hand. </p>            <p>Gullar&#8217;s analysis is certainly debatable, and it is, as I               have tried to show, tightly subject to its own historical stage.               As a case study, however, it reveals the stakes of history &#8211;               of telling history, interpreting history, of making history a product               of art. &#8220;Vanguard and Underdevelopment&#8221; ends with a               disavowal of a Brazilian, or indeed, third-world, avant-garde. Instead,               Gullar offers up the notion of the &#8220;open work&#8221;, a work               realized by the viewer&#8217;s interpretation and determined by               the viewer&#8217;s hand.[17] Poised between a dialectics of form               and one of history, the open work, in Gullar&#8217;s formulation,               functions as a <em>formal</em> model of history&#8217;s operations.               It does not substitute for history, but acts as a figure of its               hermeneutic demands.</p>            <p>This symposium is based, in part, on this assumption &#8211; that               art makes history at the moment of its production and at the moment               of its reception, however distant that reception might be. Our aim               was to gather young scholars whose work revisits the narratives               and models we have used to frame Latin American art and its engagement               with something we might call &#8220;the avant-garde.&#8221; This               comes at a moment that Latin American modern art is enjoying increased               exposure as a result of major exhibitions, themselves the result               of scholarly work years in the making. We would here underscore               that the history of Latin American art is now, as it was for Gullar,               in a process of being made. </p>            <p>Before we start, we&#8217;d like to thank our sponsors for the               event, the Department of the History of Art at Yale, the Art History               Department at CUNY, and PART, the CUNY graduate art history journal.               We also want to thank our keynote speaker and respondents for agreeing               to be a part of this conference; Olivier Debroise and Jesse Lerner,               who have generously allowed us to screen their films; and of course               our participants, who are all doing extremely exciting work within               the field.

[Meu prop&oacute;sito era outro:               de um lado, imprimir um cunho did&aacute;tico &agrave; p&aacute;gina               de artes pl&aacute;sticas que mantinha naquele suplemento e, de               outro, realizer uma esp&eacute;cie de nova leitura dos movimentos               art&iacute;sticos de car&aacute;ter construtivo a partir da vis&atilde;o               neoconcreto.] It is for this reason, Gullar notes, that he chose               not to include movements such as Expressionism or Surrealism, which               did not contribute to the &#8220;linha de desenvolvimento iniciada               com o Cubismo&#8221;.<br>              [5] In Gullar&#8217;s &#8220;Tentative de compreens&atilde;o I&#8221;               regarding Cubism, for example, the critic wrote that the &#8220;rationalist&#8221;               interpretation of Cubism offered by Gleizes and Metzinger &#8220;reconduzia               o problema aos termos da pintura tradicional, ou melhor, aos termos               de uma falsa interpreta&ccedil;&otilde; da pintura tradicional,               onde o prop&oacute;sito figurative sempre foi meio e n&atilde;o               fim. Com isso se hava um passo atr&aacute;s na compreens&atilde;o               da revolu&ccedil;&atilde;o cubista que era, na verdade, um esfor&ccedil;o               para romper de vez com o vocabul&aacute;rio figurative.&#8221; <em>Etapas               da Arte Contempor&acirc;nea</em>, p. 81. In his &#8220;Tentativa               de compreens&atilde;o II&#8221; regarding Cubism, he further noted               that &#8220;As formas geom&eacute;tricas [of Cubism] surgiram, ent&atilde;o,               da explicita&ccedil;&atilde;o da visao sint&eacute;tica de C&eacute;zanne,               e se tornaram naturalmente o ve&iacute;culo desse espaco fenomenol&oacute;gico               captado&#8230;Elas s&atilde;o o vocabul&aacute;rio de uma sensibilidade               nova, din&acirc;mica, que se quer permanente inven&ccedil;&atilde;o.               Nesse sentido, o cubismo continua mesmo &eacute; com Mondrian e               Malevitch &#8211; se n&atilde;o estamos sendo excessivamente otimistas               &#8211; come a nova fase da experi&ecirc;ncia no Brasil: a arte               neoconcreta.&#8221; <em>Etapas da Arte Contempor&acirc;nea</em>,               p. 89.<br>              [6] As he wrote in the Preface to the 2nd edition of <em>Etapas               da Arte Contempor&acirc;nea</em>, &#8220;pretendi, com uma nova               &#8216;leitura&#8217; da arte contemporianea, situar o neoconcretismo               como herdeiro conseq&uuml;ente das experi&ecirc;ncias art&iacute;sticas               mais radicais de nosso tempo.&#8221; (p. 7)<br>              [7] Gullar, &#8220;Arte Neoconcreta&#8221; reprinted in <em>Etapas               da Arte Contempor&acirc;nea</em>, p. 244.

Ram&iacute;rez&#8217;s elaboration of the particular characteristics               of a Latin American avant-garde should also be noted in two important               earlier essays, &#8220;Blueprints Circuits: Conceptual Art and Politics               in Latin America&#8221; in Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson,               eds. <em>Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology</em>.

Gullar certainly               would have been aware of the earlier essay, as he was closely linked               to the de Campos brothers at the time. His failure to cite de Campos               may have been due to the rupture between Gullar and the S&atilde;o               Paulo poets during the Neoconcrete period.
