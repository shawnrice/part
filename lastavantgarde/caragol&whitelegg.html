Focusing               on exhibition practice, our paper compares different interpretations               of the history of Latin American modern art from a US and a UK perspective.             </p>            <p>Amongst US exhibitions, the premise of this symposium invites consideration               of the 2004 show <em>Inverted Utopias: Avant-garde Art in Latin               America</em>, held at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the               theoretical model posited by its curators Mari Carmen Ram&iacute;rez               and H&eacute;ctor Olea. We accept an implicit invitation to discuss               this show, and admit to instrumentalizing it somewhat for comparison.               In contradistinction, we argue that the conceit of &#8220;Latin               American art as the site of the last avant-garde&#8221; has no currency               within UK exhibition practice. To reinforce this, we will present               two manifestations of an alternative approach, one that we are positing               as characteristic of the present development of the UK field. The               exhibitions <em>Transcontinental</em> (1990) and <em>Oiticica in               London</em> (2007) do not attempt to insert the art of Latin America               within the established canon of Modernism, nor do they position               it in relation to the project of the historical avant-garde. Instead               an interpretation of history is formed via a focused archival and               empirical review of artistic practice. </p>            <p><strong>Differences: UK and USA fields of study </strong></p>            <p>The differences in approach inherent to the US and UK relate, we               argue, to the different structure of Modern Latin American art as               a field of study within each country. In relation to the UK, this               symposium&#8217;s presupposition that Modern Latin American art               is re-emerging as a priority needs to be qualified. In Britain,               Modern Latin American Art <em>qua</em> Modern Latin American Art               is not a priority in academia or the museum. Within the academic               discipline of Art History &amp; Theory, there is one department               that validates Latin American Art &amp; Architecture as a specialist               area of post-graduate study, and this makes the description of it               as a &#8220;field&#8221; difficult to justify; it comes into being               as such only when it operates internationally. To sustain Modern               Latin American Art as a sufficiently dynamic field <em>within</em>               the UK, it has long been necessary to form collaborations with adjacent               areas of study (e.g. Latin American Studies, Modern and Contemporary               Art History). Over the past decade, the possibilities for collaboration               have increased, and they continue to proliferate. This poses a structural               tension: in order to be able to state that diverse research in Latin               American art is taking place in the UK, a nominal field, i.e. Latin               American art, must persist at the same moment that its limiting               geographical specificity is either criticized or disregarded. </p>            <p>Within the UK field therefore, the subject of the modern history               of Latin American art functions somewhat as a cipher. A recent development               (our own project is symptomatic) is self-consciousness of this fact;               an awareness that studying such a history is particularly anomalous               in a location where there is not a defined market for Latin American               art, no immediately obvious geo-political links, and limited access               to Latin American artworks. Since the first, and only survey of               Modern Latin American art in the UK, in 1989, it has been possible               to perceive this incipient self-consciousness, its transformation               into distinctive interpretative strategies that include, most recently,               an effort to authenticate the apparently anomalous ownership of               Latin American art in the UK. </p>            <p><strong>Comparison: <em>Inverted Utopias</em> </strong></p>            <p>The way in which the study of Latin American art is presently being               extended within the UK will no doubt find parallels in the US. <em>Inverted               Utopias</em>, however, remains an exemplar of an exhibition that               seems to rely on a large-scale confrontation between a Latin American               and European/US modern art canon. Such confrontations are not viable               within the UK. Taken as a milestone of the development of Latin               American art exhibitions in the US <em>Inverted Utopias</em> is               an interesting case to consider in relation to the direction of               the UK field. Aside from its achievements as a visual event, and               its commendable aim to propose new frameworks for addressing the               art of Latin America beyond the prevalent discourse of cultural               identity, <em>Inverted Utopias</em> contains contradictions that               invite speculation about the problems that the historical interpretation               of modern Latin American art carries within itself. Based on the               historical theory implicit to models of exhibiting Latin America               in the UK, we assert that using competition between these canons               as the grounds for such debates cannot, at this point, serve the               critical extension of the discourse, that the persistence of such               models might in fact be a grounds for a self-deception, entrapment,               and stasis. </p>            <p>The term avant-garde, as ascribed to Latin American Art by the               title of <em>Inverted Utopias</em>, is not a geographically neutral               given. From the moment it is uttered, it both asserts the need for               dialogue and releases the danger of co-dependency. The show offers               the Avant-garde as a lingua franca, an effective means by which               Latin American art is made immediately legible to the language of               Modernism. Rather than interrogating the premises that uphold the               theory of the Avant-garde however, the exhibition instead incorporates               the apparatus of the Avant-garde as its Modernist <em>deus ex machina</em>.               In so doing we suggest that it also accepts Modernism as a model               of history; this is the model with which the theory of the Avant-garde               is complicit and logically compatible. A historicist notion of originality,               and with it the position of Latin American art within a progressive               history, are upheld.</p>            <p>The notion of an &#8220;inverted utopia&#8221; is given to constitute               a set of apparently original and radical modifications to the avant-garde               project, for example, the pre-war Latin American avant-gardes&#8217;               valuing of a connection to art historical tradition and their countering               of post-war nihilism with a &#8220;late&#8221; utopian impulse.               But whether simple &#8220;inversion&#8221; is properly radical is               doubtful. Its meaning remains dependent on the model it reverses;               moreover it relies on the <em>normalcy</em> of that model; that               is, it leans on a schematic, non-complex and sometimes misrepresented               version of the model it is required to invert. Consequently, despite               the differences in &#8220;content&#8221; the parallel narrative               of Modern art history that <em>Inverted Utopias</em> provides is               operatively similar to the structure of the Avant-garde; taken as               the project of 20th-century art. </p>            <p>Such logic is reinforced by the structural limitations of the exhibition.               In choosing to continue to widely &#8220;field&#8221; Latin American               art, the large-scale exhibition necessitates a prescribed narrative               to foster immediate comprehension. In the case of <em>Inverted Utopias</em>               the project of the Avant-garde structures that narrative. This project               is traced over a series of discrete historical moments. Conveying               the passage of time as an unfolding totality, the exhibition replicates               the survey model from which it desires to break away in terms of               display.</p>            <p>Several abiding concerns are left in the wake of <em>Inverted Utopias</em>.               Like other recent exhibitions, such as <em>Geometry of Hope: Latin               American Abstract Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection</em>               (The Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas 2007) this is a               history of Latin American art in which the region&#8217;s external               points of contact and/or accumulated history of European-American               reception are crucial. It engages with the transnational nature               of artistic practice in the post-war period, but does not answer               to that practice&#8217;s particular test to the given geographical               parameters of Latin America. </p>            <p>To take a concrete example in <em>Inverted Utopias</em>, Antonio               Dias, for example, cannot be instrumentalized to typify an &#8220;original&#8221;               Latin American version of conceptualism; his most celebrated works               were provoked by the context of 1968 Paris, at least as much as               if not more than Brazil as his &#8220;point of origin.&#8221; Many               of the works and practices included within <em>Inverted Utopias</em>               compel the Latin American specialist to seek the hand of the non-specialist.               But at the same time that the works it supports seek this relation,               the geographical specificity of <em>Inverted Utopias</em> refuses               it; the exhibition is not ready to acknowledge and fully interrogate               the role of non-Latin American sites of production and reception.[2]             </p>            <p>Within this particular paradox, it is tempting to ask in whose               name the region is being defended. In a period defined by complexity,               by multiple, intricate processes of political change - not simply               pre-war/post-war - by unpredictable, inconsistent itinerancy, by               multiple geopolitical commitment, by multiple sites of reception               - pan-Latin American authority cannot be authentically claimed.               An acknowledgement of this fact brings with it the demand to reconsider               whether statements on twentieth century Latin American art should               be reached with such expediency, and whether they should always               be so BIG. </p>            <p>A noble reason for the continuation of the method inherent to <em>Inverted               Utopias</em> is that both scale and geographical specificity allow               for a large number of not usually seen works to be presented - temporarily,               all at once. However, the presupposition that the &#8220;temporary,               all at once&#8221; mode of viewing history is a sustainable method               for understanding or knowing history requires examination. The invisibility               of Latin American art cannot be countered by the temporary excess               in visibility that large scale exhibitions offer. The excess offered               by the survey-scale, together with the rhetorical authority offered               by the specialist, might persistently deny the larger extent of               what is <em>not</em> known about the field &#8211; and why. Such               a method does not acknowledge the fact that holes in historical               knowledge remain nor does it acknowledge or anticipate the ongoing               work of the Art Historical field <em>within</em> Latin America.               <em>Inverted Utopias</em> leaps from the field or what is known               to a general theory of the Latin American Avant-garde. The question               might be asked therefore, whether scale and expediency in presentation               can be compatible, sensitive or responsive to the nature of the               history of 20C Latin American art, and of Latin American art as               a field of study. Taking as a point of departure her own experience               as a Professor of Latin American art at University of Essex, the               scope and organization of Dawn Ades&#8217; exhibition aimed to propose               a useful pedagogic model to understand the artistic production of               that geopolitical area. The exhibition <em>Art of Latin America               Since Independence</em>, curated by Stanton Loomis Catlin (Yale               University Art Gallery,1966), served as a model for Ades&#8217;               show. Translated into Spanish and Portuguese, the catalogue for               <em>Art in Latin America</em> has occupied a particularly central               and lasting position within the field of Latin American art internationally.               With its thoughtful focused essays by Ades, Stanton Loomis Catlin,               and Guy Brett, and reproductions of original manifestoes it has               become a mandatory reference for students in the field. </p>            <p>Despite this being the most complete exhibition of Latin American               modern art since Catlin&#8217;s show, within the UK the limits of               <em>Art in Latin America</em> were quickly acknowledged and taken               as a cue for a change in strategy. The first circumvention of Ades&#8217;               survey was an exhibition curated by one of those involved in its               realization, Guy Brett. </p>            <p><em>Transcontinental: An Investigation of Reality - Nine Latin               American Artists</em> was held in both Birmingham (Ikon Gallery)               and Manchester (Cornerhouse) in Spring 1990. Opening just a year               after <em>Art in Latin America</em> Brett&#8217;s intention was               to focus on the work of contemporary artists, a field addressed               unevenly by <em>Art in Latin America</em>. It brought responses               on the part of contemporary artists to the 1989 show into its content,               and Brett, in the preface to the catalogue, addresses the limiting               historical and geographic simplifications of the survey as a model               for exhibiting Latin American art.[3] </p>            <p>Brett&#8217;s contribution to <em>Art in Latin America</em> was               a section entitled <em>A Radical Leap</em>. Each of the artists               included under this section were connected to an expanded network               brought into focus by the Signals London Gallery and its <em>Newsbulletin</em>               between 1964 and 1966. It was not explicitly stated as such then,               but is apparent now, that &#8220;A Radical Leap&#8221; was a history               of art in London as much as, if not more than, a history of art               in Latin America. It was a history inseparable from Brett&#8217;s               own agency and experience. Via <em>Transcontinental</em> this tacit               reduction of the history of Latin American art to within the borders               of British-European reception seems to be acknowledged more transparently.               It is at least considered in the basis for Brett&#8217;s selection               of artists, who were Cildo Meireles, Tunga, Jac Leirner, Waltercio               Caldas, Eugenio Dittborn, Victor Grippo, Regina Vater, Roberto Evangelista,               and Juan D&aacute;vila. Disclosing his curatorial criteria as well               as the limits of the show, Brett defines these artists as participants               in &#8220;an international urban practice of art&#8221;, one that               could be &#8220;more easily translated to a European gallery than               other kinds of work which would need a different <em>preparation</em>               if their context and force of its working were not to be lost.&#8221;[4]               With similarity to &#8220;A Radical Leap,&#8221; many of these artists               were those with whom Brett had established close contact or correspondence               over the course of his career. As such, it might be considered a               retreat and also an affirmation, in that it presented only what               he could possibly, authentically, know about contemporary Latin               American art. Also emphasized was the fact that these were artworks               that had been <em>made</em> translatable, by virtue of the artists               themselves being mobile. In his preface, Brett asks whether a more               sophisticated model for understanding their work in relation to               Latin America could become possible, one that &#8220;takes into               account the movements and journeys of artists themselves&#8221;               as well as &#8220;common patterns that arise in attitudes towards               experimental art.&#8221; [5] Such a speculation, we suggest, does               not simply instrumentalize the theories of displacement and hybridity               that had particular currency at the time of this exhibition. It               might also be used to recover questions of historical process, to               comprehend the appearance of common forms within different places               or the emergence of contradictory positions within the &#8216;trajectory&#8217;               of the individual artist. </p>            <p>The nine artists included in <em>Transcontinental</em> differ in               media and strategy. They were re-united, according to Brett, by               the impossibility of separating in each case what is &#8216;local&#8217;               from what is &#8216;global&#8217;. In different ways, each artist&#8217;s               work emphasized a fluidity and ambiguity in form, meaning, or occupation               of physical space. Each also displayed responsiveness to multiple               contexts, and thus a potential openness toward the difference in               reception that a UK exhibition would necessarily provoke. Dittborn&#8217;s               <em>Airmail Paintings</em>, for instance, are devised as artworks               made of cheap materials to be sent, in discreet envelopes, from               Chile to art institutions around the world, where they are unfolded               and occupy a substantial amount of space. The communicative versatility               of Jac Leirner&#8217;s work was also emphasized, particularly in               Brett&#8217;s manner of articulating its meaning via an anecdotal               account of his viewing it for the first time. On seeing the floor               sculptures that form part of the series <em>Os cem</em> (1986-87)               his attention was drawn to their plastic qualities, the way these               assembled dingy, bills of a non-descript color occupied space, becoming               immensely heavy. On first view he understood the works to playfully               mock formalist minimalism; it was only after finding out that they               were made of $CR 100 notes, and that these notes were devalued,               that he read this heaviness as a metaphor of inertia. In relating               the process of his own comprehension, the meaning of this work was               not simply explained according to true Brazilian origin and context,               the process of his British &#8216;misunderstanding&#8217; was accepted               and accumulatively added. </p>            <p>Although subtitled as an exhibition that addressed contemporary               Latin America, <em>Transcontinental</em> emphasized individual artist               over unifying curatorial theme. Essays on each artist were highly               individualized, and reflected a mode of viewing Latin American art               - on an artist-by-artist basis &#8211; that is the more consistent               approach within a UK field. In the UK, Brett&#8217;s engagement               with Latin American art stands out, as well as focusing on individual               artists, he has used exhibitions and writing to emphasize connections               between artists. These include those explicitly based on his own               experience and sensibility, such as <em>Transcontinental</em> and               also those which might appear to be eclectic, but whose &#8216;constellation-like&#8217;               nature has its basis in historical connections and collaborations               between artists - such as &#8220;A Radical Leap&#8221; and the exhibition               <em>Force Fields</em> (Hayward Gallery, London, 2000), also curated               by Brett. Within each, the avant-garde is not defended as a shared               and consistent project, rather it is grasped as a persistent field               of research, one that is necessarily created and sustained by a               &#8220;plurality of tactics.&#8221;[6] Shared historical goals are               not ascribed. The type of historical process that it suggests is               provisional, and thus seems closer to the nature of artistic practice,               rather than its retrospective translation into coherent narrative.               By focusing upon Latin American artists that have entered into an               &#8220;international research community,&#8221; as described by               Brett, <em>Transcontinental</em> placed a stress on artworks whose               potential for communication will be differently fulfilled according               to place of reception. This is a particular engagement with the               field of Latin American art, one that does not explicitly privilege               Latin America as the point of origin, and thus does not explicitly               privilege that origin as the basis for the artwork&#8217;s originality.             </p>            <p>However within <em>Transcontinental</em>, this origin, this &#8220;Latin               America&#8221; does persist, in the slippery form of something that               cannot be authentically circumscribed, and that is always modified               by translation. <br>              If the work of an artist loses nothing in translation, the logic               of such thinking might move towards displacing any hierarchical               ordering of reception. However, the notion that &#8216;Latin American               art in Latin America&#8217; is or was primary, and that the history               of its interaction, presence or reception elsewhere is secondary,               is persistent &#8211; even when a work is being received at two               different points with exact simultaneity. In the UK meanwhile, there               might also be a danger of privileging the authenticity of the &#8220;secondary&#8221;               site as one that is archived, and therefore not elusive, as one               that can be permanently written into history, one that is capable               to validate non-Latin American ownership of Latin American art.             </p>            <p>In this it is indicative that a provocative milestone for the UK               has not been the creation of a dedicated museum, but of an international               acquisition committee for Latin American Art within Tate, the country&#8217;s               most prominent public collection of International art. This has               been the most visible announcement of the terms according to which               both literal and symbolic ownership of the history of Latin American               Art might be established in the UK. Via the assembly of a committee               and through the role of a dedicated associate curator, a specialism               has been created nominally, but is not translated explicitly into               a defined strand of research or public programming. The activity               of translating the need for acquisition into the programming of               exhibitions began as a problem to solve, and the terms according               to which that problem is negotiated both reflect, and validate,               the ambivalent structure of Latin American art as a field of British               art historical and theoretical research. </p>            <p>In seeking to establish how this event translates into an interpretation               of modern history, and of the place of Latin America as a site of               the avant-garde, we here place greater emphasis on Tate as collector,               and how the expansion of its collection, rather than of its exhibition               programme, might come in the future to function as an influential               device for historical interpretation. </p>            <p>Tate Modern has, so far, stated its commitment to the area of Latin               American Art most loudly via large-scale one-person exhibitions.               Its acquisition of historical Latin American art however is presented               with due caution and often with less publicity. Its one-person exhibitions               thus far have focused on artists whose validity has already been               fought out and established elsewhere, presupposing a post-avant-garde               view of international art history as an already-level playing field,               containing (paraphrasing P. Burger) the legitimate side by side               existence of different styles and forms, of which none can any longer               claim to be the most advanced. The basis for originality here is               the individual artists capability to produce work that is sufficiently               different, rather than sufficiently advanced, they are not required               to have produced works of a certain type before their European or               North American contemporaries. Rather, an allusion to vanguardism               is maintained obliquely, as the fulfillment of the historical project               contained within the brackets of an artist&#8217;s &#8220;trajectory.&#8221;             </p>            <p>An interpretation of the historical position of Latin American               art might be seen to emerge however at the point at which Tate has               established a reflexive relationship between the history in which               it is willing to permanently invest, as represented by its Collection,               and the history that it is willing to acknowledge, as represented               by its exhibition of individual artists. The only explicit public               manifestation of such an intersection was an understated contextual               display, entitled <em>Oiticica in London</em>, which was accompanied               by a publication and mounted within Tate Modern&#8217;s collection               display spaces, to coincide with the traveling exhibition <em>H&eacute;lio               Oiticica, the Body of Colour</em>. </p>            <p>The contextual function of <em>Oiticica in London</em> served Tate&#8217;s               two branches of acquisition and public programming simultaneously.               As a collection display, it created a particular history around               which the decision to acquire several works by Oiticica, of which               <em>Tropic&aacute;lia</em> was the centrepiece, could be justified;               as a publication it allowed for an imported exhibition to nevertheless               generate original research, living up to a precedent set by the               2005 Frida Kahlo retrospective. Less explicitly, it was also an               important step in making sense of some of Tate&#8217;s earliest               acquisitions of Latin American art, including those purchased from               the Signals London gallery in the mid-sixties. These acquisitions               moved quietly from storage to display soon after the creation of               Tate&#8217;s Latin American Acquisition committee, and their presence               within <em>Oiticica in London</em> represented a subtle, temporary,               movement from theme to history. </p>            <p>The history presented by <em>Oiticica in London</em> however does               not explicitly identify Latin America as a discrete site for the               post-war avant-garde. With typical ambivalence, it instead constituted               the recovery of the British neo-avant-garde via the agency of a               Latin American artist, one whose place in contemporary genealogy               is now arguably more prominent internationally than British artists               of the same generation. Again, that Oiticica possesses necessary               originality is a presupposition, and is perhaps this exhibitions               own <em>deus ex machina</em> in that it underlies the ability for               his work to re-activate and recover the British sixties. </p>            <p>If viewed cynically, this small project might be read as a highly               successful gesture of appropriation. Literally and symbolically,               it made sense of Tate&#8217;s ownership of the work of Oiticica,               while also acknowledging Signals London as a precedent for the British-internationalist               perspective to which Tate is committed. The experimental, collaborative,               international and multi-disciplinary milieu surrounding Signals               London is a potential seed-bed for several genealogies for contemporary               practice, and therefore the importance of this gesture for stimulating               research concerning the history of British art is not in dispute.               But in what sense can it be recovered a critical, or at least provocative,               model for the interpretation of a Latin American avant-garde? </p>            <p>Models of historical interpretation that might be recovered from               <em>Oiticica in London</em> do resonate with emergent understandings               of Latin American art according to its points of transnational contact               and reception, and of the history of the avant-garde reconfigured               as a series of de-centred, asynchronous processes. The spatio-temporal               extension from artist to the process of completing and re-formulating               an individual artwork (<em>Tropic&aacute;lia</em>) or from artist               to a particular place (London) are historical models that favor               discontinuity; they legitimitize the fact that the aims of an artists               work might be altered according to place, that an artist might be               inconsistent or contradictory in formal terms because of this, and               that the achievement of the avant-garde project must therefore be               necessarily conceived as a process set by an intimate and shifting               set of limits, rather than a goal followed through from start to               finish by either collective history or by individual formal trajectory.               Such an understanding is in fact more consistent with how artists               such as Oiticica conceived their own practice and its responsiveness               to the demands of different locations. </p>            <p>In this sense <em>Oiticica in London</em> was valuable for encouraging               a certain intensity of focus on the particularity of individual               works. What is at stake in the permanent acquisition of a work,               rather than its temporary display, is a retroactive justification               of that artist&#8217;s historical position. In this sense, the purchase               of <em>Tropic&aacute;lia</em> stimulated more rigorous research               than the grounds for inclusion of his work in previous group shows,               including those mounted at Tate (e.g. <em>Century City: Art and               Culture in the Modern Metropolis</em>, 2001; <em>Open Systems: Rethinking               Art c. 1970</em>, 2005) and elsewhere (e.g. <em>Tropic&aacute;lia</em>,               Barbican, London, 2006), where any given work by the artist could               have been chosen for exhibition, as a token of an unchanging and               uncritical affirmation of either Brazilian identity or participatory               practice. </p>            <p>From the UK, the translation of Latin American art into the English               language is more explicitly conceived a subjective and potentially               treacherous process. It is a field that appears ready to admit the               provisional nature of its enquiry, to state that Latin American               art lies beyond an immediate, self-contained, field of knowledge,               and to be explicitly driven by seeking - and asserting - transparency               and &#8220;authenticity&#8221; in that knowledge. Like the point               reached by <em>Inverted Utopias</em>, this does return a history               of Latin American art that is limited to and re-shaped by its external               points of contact. The difference is its more explicit confession               of this fact, which might open up the question of whether it is               possible to continue to conceive of a modern history of Latin American               art without acknowledging our role in circumscribing its content.               <em>Transcontinental</em> and <em>Oiticica in London</em> are used               here as exemplars of the history of art from Latin America treated               as a field that is both complex and contingent, one that is unavoidably               informed by the different contexts in which it is both produced               and received. These approaches incite scrutiny, and thus expand               the possibility contained by shorter durations of history, bringing               to light contradictions that have a particular capacity to decay               the totalizing logic imposed unifying theories of the historical               Avant-garde. </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p>[1] The Principal Investigator of this research is Valerie Fraser               (Professor, Univeristy of Essex).
