A painter, drawer and teacher               belonging to the second generation of modern artists active in Brazil               from the 1930s on, Guignard is recognized today as one of the most               original and important Brazilian artists of the 20th century. His               quite irregular oeuvre reached its high point in the early 1940s,               with his first &#8220;Imaginary Landscapes&#8221; and &#8220;Saint               John Nights&#8221;, themes he would continue to work on throughout               his life. Along with some portraits, these landscapes allow for               a perception of Guignard&#8217;s singular contribution to the formation               of a distinctly Brazilian visuality in modern art.</p>            <p>Although often mistakenly taken for a na&iuml;ve or primitive artist,               Guignard underwent solid academic training in Europe, particularly               in Germany. His father died when he was a child, and in 1907 his               family moved to Switzerland. Before his final return to Brazil in               1929, already in his adulthood, Guignard had studied in Switzerland,               France and Germany, where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Fine               Arts of Munich in 1917. His studies at the academy provided him               with training in drawing and painting, with rigorous discipline.               Yet, even the artist himself seemed rather unclear about this period,               he referred vaguely to an exhibition of the Die Br&uuml;cke group               that he had seen in Munich and which had deeply impressed him. He               did however confess that it was at the Munich Art Collection, more               than in school, that he had learned his art, observing and copying               the works there by Flemish and Dutch artists. </p>            <p>Although Guignard participated in exhibitions since 1922, his European               production remains lost, which makes it difficult for us to know               how his artwork evolved during his years there. The only thing we               know about this period is based on the artist&#8217;s own recollection               that refers to the time he spent in Florence from 1925 to 1928 which               represented his &#8220;path to freedom.&#8221; According to Argentine               painter Em&iacute;lio Pettoruti, a friend of Guignard&#8217;s since               the 1920s, in Florence he assiduously studied the work of Botticelli,               which together with his studies of Japanese printmaking gave him               a sense for the decorative.</p>            <p>During these years he took part in exhibitions which included the               Biennale di Venezia as well as the Salon d&#8217;Automne and Salon               des Ind&eacute;pendants in Paris. He met Picasso and Utrillo at               the Caf&eacute; Duomo and became interested mainly in the painting               of Dufy, Matisse and Rousseau. Although it is not possible to analyze               Guignard&#8217;s painting from this period, we can certainly find               echoes of his European experience and his direct contact with modern               art in the work he developed following his return to Brazil.</p>            <p>As he related twenty years later, upon his arrival in Rio de Janeiro               he suffered two shocks: the first was the conservative spirit of               the city&#8217;s art world at that time; the second, even more profound,               was Brazil&#8217;s particular nature, colors and landscape. From               this point on, until the end of his life, his technique underwent               a slow but steady and complete revision.</p>            <p>Before focusing on an analysis of some of his artworks, it is worth               remembering the situation of modern art in Brazil in the late &#8217;20s               and early &#8217;30s. Roughly speaking, the late-coming development               of Brazilian modern art took place in two phases. The first was               centered on the provincial city of S&atilde;o Paulo in the late               1910s, and is characterized by an attitude of rupture with the preceding               art. This small group included Anita Malfatti, Di Cavalcanti, Oswald               de Andrade, Tarsila do Amaral and Victor Brecheret and sought &#8211;               as one of its main theoreticians, writer and art critic M&aacute;rio               de Andrade, pointed out &#8211; to renovate the cultural environment               and the national intelligence, which at the beginning of the 1920s               required a &#8220;warlike and eminently destructive&#8221; attitude.</p>            <p>At this moment, the challenge was to combine the desire for formal               updating, by way of the European avant-garde, with the aim to rediscover               Brazil in terms of its popular traditions and heterogeneous culture               suffocated by the 19th-century Brazilian intelligentsia&#8217;s               &#8220;colonized and conservative veneration of things French.&#8221;               At his 1942 conference on the modernist movement, M&aacute;rio de               Andrade summarized this double aim according to three fundamental               principles: &#8220;the permanent right to aesthetic research; the               updating of Brazilian artistic intelligence; and the establishment               of a national creative consciousness.&#8221; Initially, this group               did not espouse a single approach for Brazilian art, and in terms               of the visual arts it accommodated the formal lessons of cubism,               the spirit of expressionism and the colorful fauvism without major               conflicts.</p>            <p>A second generation of modern artists, or a second modernist phase,               took place from 1930 onward, when Brazilian modern art became more               socially engaged, showing more concern for depicting Brazil&#8217;s               social reality while focusing less on formal issues. Naturally,               this movement closely followed a recession of European avant-garde               experimentation and the expansion of Mexican muralism throughout               the Americas. The artist who best represents this interwar period               is Candido Portinari, Brazil&#8217;s official modernist painter               in the 1940s.</p>            <p>Although a fuller discussion of the subject lies outside the scope               of this article, it should be pointed out that, with few exceptions,               the modernist movement in Brazil was indissociable from nationalist               aims. At an early stage, the modernist nationalism took the form,               for example, of Oswald de Andrade&#8217;s anthropophagic primitivism               in 1928. For him, the mere updating of the medium was not enough;               it was necessary to &#8220;swallow&#8221; what came from outside               and to re-create it based on local experience. As early as 1920,               M&aacute;rio de Andrade was suspicious of the praise that Tarsila               do Amaral, then living in Paris, heaped on cubism. For him, modern               art as it was being developed in the hegemonic center ran the risk               of becoming &#8220;excessively aestheticizing&#8221; and, in a good-humored               tone, he invited Tarsila to return to Brazil to found a new movement,               &#8220;Matavirgismo&#8221; [Virginforestism].</p>            <p>In fact, there are various versions of Nationalism. There exists               a series of gradations lying between the one end of the spectrum               &#8211; the position of these first modernists, who sought to give               rise to the &#8220;new man&#8221; by rejecting the classical European               values while re-valorizing the Brazilian primitive art with African               and indigenous roots (and which art critic M&aacute;rio Pedrosa               called, kindly, &#8220;primordial, irreducible and anti-erudite&#8221;               &#8220;primitive, na&iuml;ve Nationalism&#8221;) ; on the other,               the superficial and strict forms of patriotic Nationalism serving               conservative and reactionary aims, especially from the mid-1930s               onward.</p>            <p>During the era instated by President Get&uacute;lio Vargas and               called the Estado Novo &#8211; the moment at which modern art finally               became publicly accepted and to a certain extent institutionalized               in Brazil &#8211; Portinari&#8217;s socially motivated ideological               Nationalism provided the acceptable model of modern art. In a classical-realist               form, but with expressive and salient deformations (of the feet               and hands, for example), this art was nevertheless constrained within               an acceptable decorum, and embodied the nationalist question and               that of the Brazilian man in the figure of the worker. For art critic               Ronaldo Brito, Portinari represented the triumph of the &#8220;literary               character of the ideology of Brazilianness.&#8221; </p>            <p>In short, for better or for worse, the nationalist question was               a constant in the Brazilian modernism of the first half of the 20th               century. While the research into &#8220;Brazilianness&#8221; enriched               the Brazilian visuality, raising awareness in regard to popular               manifestations and the image of the common folk which up to then               had hovered at the fringe of the cultural system, on the other hand,               at certain moments, it acted as a censor when it was taken as a               doctrine to be followed and as an antidote to the more radical experiments.               This ambiguity &#8211; the commitment to national awareness and               the autonomy of visual-arts research &#8211; marks a good part of               the most consistent production of Brazilian modern art.</p>            <p>Although it was not an outgrowth of these developments, certainly               Guignard&#8217;s Brazilian production was influenced by these issues.               What makes it so singular, however, is the fact that its primitive               appearance rarely resorts to the ease of anecdote nor recurs to               solutions based on extra-artistic commitment. As art historian S&ocirc;nia               Salzstein has observed, &#8220;his specificity does not derive from               &#8216;Brazilian thematics,&#8217; but from the original way that               this thematics is infused within the essential power of his oeuvre.             </p>            <p>After a production with surrealist leanings in the late 1920s,               Guignard began a series of paintings in which he sought to capture               simple scenes or people from Brazilian life, in family portraits               and interior scenes such as <em>Os Noivos [The Fianc&eacute;s]</em>,               1937 [Figure 1], or <em>Fam&iacute;lia do Fuzileiro Naval [The Marine&#8217;s               Family]</em>, no date [Figure 2]. This production, which at the               time was called &#8220;Lyric Nationalism&#8221; evinced Guignard&#8217;s               preference for the more prosaic and less heroic aspects of national               life. Both paintings feature people from a less-favored social class,               whom Guignard nevertheless valorizes through colorist treatment               and Matisse-influenced composition. </p>            <table width="642" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td><img src="images/palhares1.jpg" width="205" height="250"></td>                <td> Figure 1. <em>Os noivos [The fianc&eacute;s]</em>, 1937<br>                  Oil on canveas, 58 x 48 cm<br>                  Collection Museus Castro Maya, Rio de Janeiro</td>              </tr>              <tr>                <td>&nbsp;</td>                <td>&nbsp;</td>              </tr>              <tr>                 <td width="222"><img src="images/palhares2.jpg" width="207" height="250"></td>                <td width="420"><br>                  Figure 2. <em>Fam&iacute;lia do fuzileiro naval [Marine&#8217;s                   family]</em>, no date.<br>                  Oil on wood, 58 x 48 cm<br>                  Collection M&aacute;rio de Andrade - IEB-USP, S&atilde;o Paulo</td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>In these paintings, the modern palate of contrasting colors is               blended with decorative elements typical of popular culture. However,               here these decorative elements &#8211; the flowers, the fabrics               printed in popular patterns, the drawings on the wallpaper, the               stripes on the boys&#8217; clothes, the arabesques of the railing               on the balcony &#8211; do not function as elements for structuring               space. It seems that the conspicuous presence and energy of the               decorative in the composition does not contaminate the human figures               beyond the surface of their clothes. The latent happiness of the               environment seems to contrast with the stern attitude of the people,               who show no hint of a smile.</p>            <p>There is a further, even more significant contrast. When we observe               the landscape projected like a backdrop to the portrait of the Marine&#8217;s               family, we perceive that there is a significant difference between               the lines used inside the room and the colored patches making up               the outside scene. Certainly, there is a transition between the               interior and exterior colors, yet the landscape&#8217;s scarcely               delineated character, its atmospheric expansion, contrasts with               the relative rigidity of the architecture and the people.</p>            <p>This same paradoxical construction can be observed in a 1939 landscape,               in which Guignard deals with the theme of the &#8220;Saint John&#8217;s               Festival&#8221; traditionally held in Brazil in the month of June.               <em>Festa de S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o [Saint John&#8217;s Festival]</em>,               1939 [Figure 3], offers an aerial view, from a distance, of the               nocturnal celebrations of Saint John&#8217;s Day in a typical Brazilian               town. This is one of the most traditional festivals in popular culture,               celebrated during the month of June, when colorful balloons rise               into the night sky to celebrate the days of Saint John, Saint Anthony               and Saint Peter. Here there is a striking contrast between the architecture               of the colonial town in the foreground and the image of the mountains               and sky that takes up nearly two-thirds of the canvas. </p>            <table width="646" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td width="270"><img src="images/palhares3.jpg" width="250" height="171"></td>                <td width="376"> Figure 3. <em>Festa de S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o                   [St. John&acute;s Festival]</em>, 1939<br>                  Oil on canvas, 55 x 80 cm<br>                  Collection Ricardo Akagawa, S&atilde;o Paulo</td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>Guignard&#8217;s June festival landscapes were gradually taken               over by this indefinite space that seems like a dilution, were it               not for a paper balloon, a train or a church, or even a small image               of the painter himself, which seem like attempts to delineate this               nature in a process of change, though in no wise imposing a structure               on it. Indeed, as we can see in <em>Paisagem de Minas [Minas Gerais               Landscape]</em> (Figure 4), there is even a suggestion of movement               in the cloud-mountains that appear in counterpoint to the static               quality of the figures.</p>            <table width="648" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td width="296"><img src="images/palhares4.jpg" width="275" height="166"></td>                <td width="418">Figure 4. <em>Paisagem de Minas Gerais [Minas                   Gerais Landscape]</em>, 1950 <br>                  Oil on wood, 110 x 180 cm<br>                  Collection Angela Gutierrez, Belo Horizonte</td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>Obviously, this lack of integration between the well-delimited,               floating characters and the space constructed through overlain patches               of color cannot be attributed to a lack of technical skill on the               part of the artist, which would approximate him to the so-called               na&iuml;ve artists. The spatial treatment used in this landscape               blends techniques drawn from an entire erudite pictorial tradition               stretching from Leonardo da Vinci to the German romantics, and also               including impressionist landscape, with which Guignard dialogues               here.</p>            <p>In the countless landscapes the artist painted throughout his life,               the paint gradually became more diluted. As it can be observed in               this <em>Noite de S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o [Saint John&#8217;s Night]</em>               from 1961 (Figure 5), made one year before his death, the artist               worked on the modernist problem of the relation between figure and               background by means of a all-over space. </p>            <table width="608" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td width="225"><img src="images/palhares5.jpg" width="206" height="225"></td>                <td width="383">Figure 5. <em>Noite de S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o                   [St. John&#8217;s Night]</em>, 1961<br>                  Oil on wood, 50 x 46 cm<br>                  Collection Roberto Marinho, Rio de Janeiro<br> </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>The autonomy of the pictorial material revealed in this canvas               was a late-coming achievement, but an important one for Brazilian               art. It indicates a freer cultural environment, in which the artist               does not need to illustrate something in order to legitimize his               existence. As I see it, this autonomy was at this moment a very               helpful development for the conservative Brazilian art world, and               in a certain way it contributed to the formation of a later generation               of artists involved in important local movements (it should be noted               that Guignard was the professor and friend, for example, of two               neoconcrete artists, Amilcar de Castro and Franz Weissmann).</p>            <p>Returning our attention to the painting <em>Noite de S&atilde;o               Jo&atilde;o</em>, we note that the small figures that serve to orient               us in this indefinite and blurred space &#8211; and which are a               direct reference to Brazilian culture &#8211; almost seem to be               floating, as though they were not actually rooted in the landscape.               Made by quick brushstrokes that evoke only their outlines, the fragility               of these little churches, little balloons and little trains somehow               evinces Guignard&#8217;s melancholic view of this pre-industrial               country, moving along at a slow pace. While there is certainly no               condemnation of this situation, the nostalgia that seems to permeate               this painting conveys an identity that perhaps pertains finally               to the realm of imagination or memory, and which the painting sought               to make real. Far from the overoptimistic patriotism and social               realism prevailing in the culture and art in Brazil at that time,               Guignard focused on this inward and mysterious country, and, solely               through the visual arts, apprehended its irreducible experience.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p> [1] Andrade, M&aacute;rio. &#8220;O Movimento Modernista&#8221;               (Conference held at the Casa do Estudante do Brasil no Rio de Janeiro               em 1942).
