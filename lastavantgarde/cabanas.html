On the one hand, there is the repeated thematic               reference to the rejection of a pictorial language solely premised               on European modernism in favor of what I would call, following Gayatri               Spivak, a &#8220;strategic essentialism&#8221;&#8212;that is, a               desire on the part of artists be it in Brazil or Cuba to infuse               their work with images of the local as a way to create a nationalist               visual language, particularly in the 1920s and 30s. Indeed, this               &#8220;strategic essentialism&#8221; in search of &#8220;Brazilianess&#8221;               or <em>lo cubano</em> became a way for artists to instantiate a               rupture with the traditions of European painting. On the other hand,               the papers also address the historical moment of the 1950s and the               general move toward abstraction, be it geometric in the case of               Brazil and Venezuela or gestural in the case of Cuba. At this time,               artists abandoned the iconographic and figurative elements associated               with an earlier generation of painters. Yet the limit case in the               context of this panel is the work of Elenor Koch in relation to               the development of concrete art in Brazil. I&#8217;ll come back               to this point when I speak to Fernanda&#8217;s paper. </p>            <p>For me, I think what is largely at stake in these papers, and in               the writing on abstraction in Latin America more generally, is the               question of <em>how</em> to write this history without falling into               the tropes of the fantastic, peripheral, derivative, imported or               even the inverted, as proposed in the title of Mari-Carmen Ram&iacute;rez&#8217;s               exhibition <em>Inverted Utopias</em>. Indeed, the terms usually               associated with Latin American art&#8212;at least in the United               States and thus the particular context in which and from which I               speak&#8212;position artists in Latin America as <em>always already</em>               other or through a model of &#8220;inversion&#8221; do not necessarily               chip away at the dichotomous thinking that largely subtends such               a framework. Here, I would like to add that it would be productive               to revisit the concept of &#8220;network&#8221; that Dan introduced               this morning as a way of problematizing the model of &#8220;constellation&#8221;               proposed by <em>Inverted Utopias</em>. </p>            <p>Moving on to the papers, I will pose some questions that the speakers               may choose to think about further or address at this time. </p>            <p align="center">*</p>            <p>Taisa, in terms of your assessment of Guignard&#8217;s paintings               <em>as</em> painting, you chart a shift toward an &#8220;atmospheric               expansion&#8221; that ultimately serves as the pictorial ground               within which architectural elements are situated. It is with the               development of this abstract spatiality that you direct our attention               to the autonomy of painting, foregrounding the dissolution of form               and the materialization of pictorial devices in Guignard&#8217;s               work. In this context, would it be productive for you to think about               the late Guignard in relation to Armando Rever&oacute;n? Luis P&eacute;rez-Oramas               describes Rever&oacute;n&#8217;s work within the terms of what he               calls an &#8220;involuntary modernism.&#8221; This concept might               be quite suggestive for you in accounting for Guignard&#8217;s work               and the tension it exhibits between visual description and modernist               effects. </p>            <p>Fernanda, you ask how is one to think Koch&#8217;s &#8220;non adherence               to &#8216;pure&#8217; constructivism&#8221;? You begin to develop               a possible answer to the question you pose, and I would like to               ask to what extent you might think about Koch&#8217;s non-pure concretism               as anticipating in the realm of painting some of the concerns that               are ultimately radicalized in the work of neo-concrete artists.               For me, this is ultimately to ask: What is Koch&#8217;s relation               to phenomenology? Her early work exhibits a tension between materiality&#8212;the               unevenness of the pigment load in each stroke, as well as the luminosity               of her technique&#8212;and the way that line does not serve to imitate               the visible, but rather <em>renders visible</em> within her application               of abstract colored planes. Can you elaborate on this tension between               what one sees and what one is given to conceptually understand through               Koch&#8217;s rather limited use of line in her paintings of the               early 1960s? And could you further place her work in relation to               her contemporaries? For example, you might consider the work in               relation to <em>Id&eacute;ia vis&iacute;vel</em> (1956) by Waldemar               Cordeiro.</p>            <p>Megan, you persuasively develop the cultural anxiety in Venezuela               that &#8220;Venezuela had to catch up with Universal time.&#8221;               But rather than the grid &#8220;covering over&#8221; and &#8220;replacing               the sky&#8221; as you maintain, what might it mean in the context               of Otero&#8217;s <em>Policrom&iacute;as</em> to say that the grid               and sky are looked at <em>together</em>, that they exist in metonymic               or even indexical relation with one another. Basically, I would               like to put forth a few questions: How do the material conditions               that the <em>Policrom&iacute;as</em> inhabit (i.e., the light and               sky, their attendant changes depending on the season and time of               day) modify the perception of the <em>Policrom&iacute;as&#8217;</em>               blue colored surfaces? How can one begin to think Otero&#8217;s               polychromatic grid apart from the model of &#8220;importation&#8221;               that you propose? My final question concerns more specifically local               architectural traditions in relation to polychromy and whether in               distinguishing the tradition of <em>policrom&iacute;a</em> from               the <em>mural</em> you might further nuance your analysis. Thus,               together with Otero&#8217;s <em>Policrom&iacute;as</em>, I would               like to show two images of colonial churches in Venezuela that highlight               this polychromatic tradition, which is to be distinguished from               the mural tradition.</p>            <p>In the case of Cuba, Abby, your paper nicely contributes to an               understanding of how abstraction is made to signify in different               ways and how the very ambiguity or ambivalence of abstraction&#8212;its               lack of explicit iconographic motivation&#8212;in large measure               determines its abandonment in Cuba. However, you end by framing               the revolution as perhaps a bit too <em>punctual</em> in its abandonment               of abstract art. And, while outside the purview of your paper, I               was wondering if you have thought about the contributions of members               of Los Once in attempting to define a revolutionary aesthetic (in               particular Hugo Consuegra). Also, given that the dominant mode of               painterly abstraction in Cuba differs from abstraction as it unfolds               in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, how do you account for the historical               specificity of Cuban abstract painting in terms of the prominence               of geometric abstraction in these other Latin American countries?</p>            <p align="center">*</p>            <p>Lastly, I would like all panelists to position their work in relation               to the discursive framing and conceptual conceit of the symposium,               <em>Latin America: The Last Avant-Garde</em>. How is one to think               about this lastness that in some instances is experienced <em>as               if</em> for the first time. And is <em>lastness</em> something that               ultimately never arrives, a perpetual deferment that leaves the               possibility of an avant-garde an open question <em>for the future</em>               rather that the product of a foreclosed past. </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>*<strong>Author&#8217;s note:</strong> Aspects of the text&#8217;s               oral presentation have remained unchanged in its present incarnation.             </p></td>        </tr>      </table>          </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
