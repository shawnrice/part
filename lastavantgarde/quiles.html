Thanks also to               all of today&#8217;s participants, who I will be introducing in               turn. Lastly I would like to thank my co-organizer, Irene Small,               with whom it has been a genuine privilege to work on this conference               and enjoy that rarest of academic dialogues: a honest one.</p>            <p>I wanted to introduce today&#8217;s considerations of institutions               and abstraction with a brief discussion of a concept fundamental               to our understanding of avant-gardes: the network. It is safe to               say that without the network, the avant-garde does not exist; indeed,               avant-gardes are themselves networks. For Latin American artists,               &#8220;networks&#8221; have comprised not only connections with               galleries and institutions but also far more elusive and no less               important informal exchanges spanning international borders. Networks               thus mark geographical, professional, and aesthetic trajectories,               while productively undermining &#8220;Latin American&#8221; as a               fixed identity. Through ideational and capitalist networks, &#8220;Latin               American&#8221; art is always already dispersed throughout the world.               As I am defining it, the mapping of networks might yield more specificity               than the &#8220;constellation&#8221; model devised by Mari Carmen               Ram&iacute;rez and H&eacute;ctor Olea for their paradigmatic <em>Inverted               Utopias</em> exhibition. Adapted from Theodor Adorno, the &#8220;constellation&#8221;               maps &#8220;a series of randomly connected luminous points that               have no intrinsic relationship to one another.&#8221;[1] In contrast,               the network tethers us to history, to actual movement, and to circuits               of exchange and capital. </p>            <p>A few recent examples demonstrate the possibilities of attending               to networks in the historicization of our field. Gabriel P&eacute;rez-Barreiro&#8217;s               <em>The Geometry of Hope</em> exhibition eschewed a broad sampling               of the entire continent by privileging networks in just five cities:               Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, S&atilde;o Paolo, Caracas, and Paris.[2]               In knowingly exposing himself to criticism that he was focusing               on centers of power and money at the expense of what might be called               &#8220;the periphery of the periphery,&#8221; P&eacute;rez-Barreiro               did highlight the importance of city-based networks&#8212;in some               cases in foreign cities&#8212;for Latin American modernism. In contrast,               Ram&iacute;rez&#8217;s celebrated <em>Documents of 20th Century               Latin American and Latino Art Project</em> at the International               Center for the Arts of the Americas (begun 2001) in which research               institutions in different cities throughout the Americas share documents               and research, has effectively created its own scholarly network.[3]               The fact that these many materials will ultimately be collected               in at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, reminds us that networks               tend to be hierarchical, not rhizomic.</p>            <p>A historical example speaks to the centrality of the network in               contexts in which resources or freedoms are limited. Inaugurated               in 1969 by lighting entrepeneur and art critic Jorge Glusberg, the               Centro de Arte y Comunicaci&oacute;n [CAYC] oversaw the majority               of art production in Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s and served               as a conduit for international artists and exhibitions traveling               through the country.[4] Advocating an Argentine conceptual art that               he dubbed, following artists such as Hans Haacke, <em>arte de sistemas</em>,               Glusberg utilized his connections with the larger figures in New               York conceptualism such as Lucy Lippard, Seth Sieglaub, and Willoughby               Sharp to bring well-known American and European artists to CAYC,               among them Dennis Oppenheim, Lawrence Weiner and Mel Bochner. Glusberg               also promoted his own group of conceptual artists, which met weekly,               worked collaboratively, and often attended biennials together. This               <em>Grupo de los Trece</em> exemplifes an &#8220;avant-garde&#8221;               that owed its very creation to an institutionally-based network.[5]</p>            <p>CAYC devised a uniform graphic design for its publications. Yellow               leaflets, always in the same font, were distributed internationally               for every show. Group exhibitions, such as the multiple iterations               of <em>Arte de sistemas</em> allotted each artist the same amount               of page space in the &#8220;catalogues,&#8221; often consisting               of separate pages collected in a box.[6] These were templates&#8212;here               with a grid format as a substrate for each contribution&#8212;that               presented, quite tidily, difference within sameness. This practice               of standardization was a ubiquitous formal device for CAYC, an analogy               for its larger ambition as a network. The collection and assimilation               of artists of different nationalities and practices seeks to elide               distinctions (formal, cultural, political) between them. That being               said, the Center&#8217;s focus always returned to Argentine conceptual               artists; at root it was a promotional apparatus, and one can only               promote the specific. The &#8220;close reading&#8221; of the formal               structures of publications and exhibitions institutional networks               produce may thus enrich our understanding of the art they support               and exhibit.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p> [1] Mari Carmen Ram&iacute;rez, &#8220;The Displacement of Utopias,&#8221;               in <em>Versions and Inversions: Perspectives on Avant-Garde Art               in Latin America</em>, ed.
