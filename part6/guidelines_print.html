To this end, make sure that all images submitted are accompanied         by credit information, including artist's name, title of piece, year,         media, dimensions, and appropriate credit line. <br>        Example: Whitfield Lovell, Eight Rock, 1999, charcoal on wood, posts,         98 x 70 x 21 inches.

The credit lines for each image should be put into a text document         separate from the images, making sure that it is clear which image goes         with which credit line.
