While the grand barrel-vaulted ceilings of the central sculpture               hall are not adorned with celestial constellations as at the train               station, the skylights allow immense shafts of sunlight through               to the galleries, allowing the marble sculptures to glitter and               glow. The superb renovation complements the Museum's noted collection               of antiquities, which grew phenomenally from 1905 until about 1917,               when a team comprised of Edward Perry Warren, a wealthy American               collector, John Marshall, Warren's buying agent, and</font><font class="second">               Edward Robinson, assistant director of the Museum, commandeered               a steady influx of ancient artifacts, including world-class bronzes,               marbles, pottery, engraved gems, and terracottas. From 1912 to 1917,               the architectural firm McKim, Mead and White created the original               galleries for the collection, which today includes more than 35,000               objects. Together with the Robert and Ren&eacute;e Belfer Court               (opened in June 1996) these new galleries represent the first two               phases of a three part campaign. The final phase of the master plan               includes remodeling what is presently a restaurant and public cafeteria               into a Roman atrium for sculpture and transforming executive offices               into galleries for Roman and Etruscan art and a study collection               area, thus completing the sweep of history presented in this museum-within-a-museum-from               prehistory to classical to the Hellenistic-Roman periods. When completed               sometime after 2005, the overall exhibition space will total an               enormous 60,000 square feet.</font>             <p> <font class="second">Upon entering the galleries from the Museum's               Great Hall, the first object one encounters is an understated yet               lovely bronze rod tripod stand from the early 6th century BC. The               tripod would have supported a bronze vessel, and is adorned with               couchant sphinxes and horse <i>protomes</i> that seem to presage               the Parthenon steeds, with their heads and forelegs emerging from               beneath a base. The tripod's legs form lyrical intersections between               verticals and horizontals, and it is also pleasing and surprising               to look through the object into the sculpture hall across a vista               that culminates in the stout Sardis Column. To follow the chronology               of the galleries, the visitor begins in the Pre-History Gallery.               Here one finds enigmatic Cycladic figures and the magnificent seated               harp player that is the earliest of the small number of known representations               of musicians. The Minoan Gems collection, displayed on the west               wall, is comprised of a 1926 bequest of seals from the collection               assembled by Richard B. Seager, an archeologist active in Crete.               The diminutive seals, used for identification of ownership, resemble               precious jewels and were carved from such materials as ivory, bone,               shell, and soft stones, and later from harder stones such as rock               crystal and hematite and semiprecious stones such as agate. Presented               for the viewer are the actual stone, the impression it makes on               clay, and a crisp photograph of that impression, allowing for three               different ways to experience the image. The exquisitely-carved objects               reward close investigation: an octopus, surprisingly realistic with               its delicate splaying tentacles, contrasts with an earlier, more               abstract and stylized depiction of the same creature. From here,               one may venture east into the Seventh and Sixth Century Gallery,               (these two galleries are the Robert and Ren&eacute;e Belfer Court,               Phase I of the greater renovation project), where one is offered               a taste of the presentation style that carries through most of the               new galleries: each vitrine is devoted to a different aspect of               Greek life. Clever mixtures of materials (e.g. bronze, glass, terracotta)               and artifacts (e.g. statuettes, drinking cups, plates) create crosscurrents               and interrelationships within and among displays that not only highlight               different aspects of Greek life but also make the works come alive,               offering the viewer an extremely accessible &quot;transversal cut               through the civilization,&quot; according to Philippe de Montebello.               For example, a display of bronze helmets and belly guards creates               a dialogue with a nearby vitrine, which contains three terracotta               perfume vases in the form of helmeted heads. The warriors' eyes               steadfastly peek out from between the bronze flaps-one can envision               therefore the usage of the actual bronze helmets. Exhibit clusters               throughout the galleries are devoted to religion, myth, death and               the afterlife, the gods, heroes, and the symposium. In the Jaharis               Gallery is a fascinating group of objects related to sports and               the Panathenaic festivals: large prize amphorae for sacred olive               oil (some decorated with images of footraces), bronze statuettes               of athletes, a marble discus, and even various items associated               with post-exercise cleansing such as a strigil, used by athletes               for wiping the skin clean after cleansing with oil.</font>             <p> <font class="second">The new galleries are organized such that               a chronological tour necessitates crossing back and forth through               the central spine, the magnificent McKim, Mead and White hallway               modeled on the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican Museum (which itself               was modeled on the public baths of ancient Rome). Following this               path, the large statues correspond with the centuries celebrated               in the galleries on either side. Probably one of the more significant               transformations brought about by the renovation is the alteration               of previous traffic patterns. Previously, Museum visitors on their               way to the cafeteria rushed through this hallway, then lined with               Cypriot sculptures, blandly displayed and pushed up against the               wall. Now named the Mary and Michael Jaharis Gallery, the sunlit               room is ideal for exhibiting large scale marble sculpture. Traffic               has slowed to a contemplative stroll, and visitors now linger, taking               the time to view these works fully in the round and admire the changing               effects of sunlight on the carved surfaces. One cannot miss the               <i>Statue of a Wounded Warrior</i>, located practically in the center               of the gallery. The unusual stance of the warrior-his feet are carefully               placed on a sloping surface-has provoked various identifications,               including the Greek hero Protesilaos, who ignored an oracle's warning               that the first Greek to step on Trojan soil would be the first to               die in battle.</font></p>                      <table width="122" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="dpilso_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="pil2cont.jpg" width="131" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"> <a href="dpilso_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">Exekias,                     <i>Black-Figured Neck Amphora with Lid: On Each Side Wedding                     Procession in a Chariot</i>.

The elegant presentations breathe fresh life into               the vases, which were previously displayed unimaginatively, row               upon row, in a dark room on the second floor of the Museum. Two               works by Andokides, set in separate vitrines but in close proximity,               skillfully illustrate the transition from black-figure to red-figure               vase painting. Nearby, a terracotta column krater painted by Lydos               is cleverly juxtaposed with a case containing pieced-together fragments               of another krater decorated by the same artist. In the second von               Bothmer Gallery, the lavishly decorated and dramatic Euphronios               vase creates a striking dialogue with the more understated Berlin               vase, which depicts against a stark background a singer playing               a kithara, a lyre used for the recitation of epic poetry. With its               delicate lines and emphatic silhouette, the Berlin vase is a masterpiece               of Greek vase painting.</font>             <p> <font class="second">To aid the interpretation of the often enigmatic               Greek pots, related materials are presented alongside to convey               a much larger sense of culture. For example, in the Judy and Michael               H. Steinhardt Gallery, a tiny bronze statuette of a horse shares               a case with a terracotta neck-amphora decorated with a painted chariot               drawn by four horses. Another vitrine focuses on a single artist,               illustrating one of the many laborious tasks of archeologists: isolating               a particular artistic hand from so many others. Here, a group of               works by the Amasis painter illustrate the artist's wide range of               subjects, which includes an imaginative rendering of Poseidon's               underwater stables described in the Iliad, as well as vignettes               of everyday life such as a woman working a loom.</font>             <p> <font class="second">In order to comprehend the rationale behind               the presentations, as well as to appreciate fully each artifact,               multiple visits to these galleries are necessary. Particular objects               not to be missed include a pelican's foot shell used for pouring               a burial libation, located in the Weiner Gallery. Perhaps the most               delicate object in the entire collection, the carved marble is so               thin it is virtually translucent. Another startling discovery located               nearby is the set of larger-than-life-size eyes from a lost bronze               statue. Eerie yet stunning, the eyes are composed of bronze, marble,               frit, quartz, and obsidian, and are carefully created with each               iris and pupil ringed with eyelashes. Perhaps the most poignant               object can be found among the Museums' monumental collection of               stone funeral reliefs: a skillfully carved Parian marble grave stele               that depicts a young girl clutching her pet doves, solemnly kissing               one on the beak. The <i>New York Kouros</i> in the Michael Steinhardt               gallery is one of the earliest marble statues of a human figure               carved in Attica. Intended to mark the grave of a young Athenian               aristocrat, the Kouros stands rigidly, in a pose derived from Egyptian               art. A terracotta volute krater in the Stavros and Dana‘ Costopoulos               Gallery is striking in its architectonic character. The staid vertical               ribbing of the body contrasts with the lively and exquisitely detailed               crowning frieze that depicts the frolicking Dionysos and his retinue.</font>             <p> <font class="second">One quibble with the presentation in the               new galleries discussed by Gary Wills in <i>The New York Review               of Books</i> (June 10, 1999) is the mere passing glance at the role               of women, slavery, and homosexuality in Greek life. While war, sports,               religion, and myth are fascinating and offer a wealth of interrelationships               between objects, Wills thought that perhaps more could have been               done to reflect these current and hotly debated topics. From exploring               the galleries, however, it seems evident that the curators have               seriously pondered the particular strengths of what is essentially               a conservative collection. While the objects might include illustrations               of such subjects as homosexuality or slavery, they do not necessarily               lend themselves to in-depth qualitative or quantitative inquiries.               The thematic groupings are didactic and extremely educational, yet               they are not meant to be dramatically pioneering.</font>             <p> <font class="second">Overall, the new galleries reward many levels               of inquiry. The casual visitor can wander through the galleries,               investigating objects that catch the eye. The addition of four doors               leading into the main hall enables a variety of itineraries, including               one that adheres to a strict chronology. Abundant explanatory wall               texts, maps, and object labels provide a wealth of information.               The objects themselves, through their groupings and juxtapositions,               provoke contemplation, and encourage the visitor to form opinions               and draw further conclusions. The didactic presentation stimulates               the casual viewer, provides further information for those with a               stronger background in the field, and offers novel and fresh ways               of approaching the material for scholars and specialists. A deeply               satisfying experience on any level.</font>             <p> <font class="second"><i>Postscript</i>: In April, 2000, The Metropolitan               Museum of Art opened the new Cypriot galleries, which display major               works from the Cesnola Collection, formed by Luigi Palma di Cesnola               (1832-1904), who became American consul on Cyprus in 1865. After               excavating there for over a decade, in 1872 he sold his collection               to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and seven years later became               the Museum's first director. Issues of cultural patrimony aside,               it is the most significant collection of ancient Cypriot art outside               of Cyprus. The four new galleries trace the chronological development               of Cypriot art through a selection of works from the Cesnola Collection,               which covers a time span from about 2500 BC until about 300 AD.</font>             <P><font class="second"><a href="dpilso_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font> </P>          </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Dana Pilson.
