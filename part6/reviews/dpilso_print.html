While the grand         barrel-vaulted ceilings of the central sculpture hall are not adorned         with celestial constellations as at the train station, the skylights allow         immense shafts of sunlight through to the galleries, allowing the marble         sculptures to glitter and glow. The superb renovation complements the         Museum's noted collection of antiquities, which grew phenomenally from         1905 until about 1917, when a team comprised of Edward Perry Warren, a         wealthy American collector, John Marshall, Warren's buying agent, and</font>         <font class="second">Edward Robinson, assistant director of the Museum,         commandeered a steady influx of ancient artifacts, including world-class         bronzes, marbles, pottery, engraved gems, and terracottas. From 1912 to         1917, the architectural firm McKim, Mead and White created the original         galleries for the collection, which today includes more than 35,000 objects.         Together with the Robert and Ren&eacute;e Belfer Court (opened in June         1996) these new galleries represent the first two phases of a three part         campaign. The final phase of the master plan includes remodeling what         is presently a restaurant and public cafeteria into a Roman atrium for         sculpture and transforming executive offices into galleries for Roman         and Etruscan art and a study collection area, thus completing the sweep         of history presented in this museum-within-a-museum-from prehistory to         classical to the Hellenistic-Roman periods. When completed sometime after         2005, the overall exhibition space will total an enormous 60,000 square         feet.</font>       <p> <font class="second">Upon entering the galleries from the Museum's Great         Hall, the first object one encounters is an understated yet lovely bronze         rod tripod stand from the early 6th century BC. The tripod would have         supported a bronze vessel, and is adorned with couchant sphinxes and horse         <i>protomes</i> that seem to presage the Parthenon steeds, with their         heads and forelegs emerging from beneath a base. The tripod's legs form         lyrical intersections between verticals and horizontals, and it is also         pleasing and surprising to look through the object into the sculpture         hall across a vista that culminates in the stout Sardis Column. To follow         the chronology of the galleries, the visitor begins in the Pre-History         Gallery. Here one finds enigmatic Cycladic figures and the magnificent         seated harp player that is the earliest of the small number of known representations         of musicians. The Minoan Gems collection, displayed on the west wall,         is comprised of a 1926 bequest of seals from the collection assembled         by Richard B. Seager, an archeologist active in Crete. The diminutive         seals, used for identification of ownership, resemble precious jewels         and were carved from such materials as ivory, bone, shell, and soft stones,         and later from harder stones such as rock crystal and hematite and semiprecious         stones such as agate. Presented for the viewer are the actual stone, the         impression it makes on clay, and a crisp photograph of that impression,         allowing for three different ways to experience the image. The exquisitely-carved         objects reward close investigation: an octopus, surprisingly realistic         with its delicate splaying tentacles, contrasts with an earlier, more         abstract and stylized depiction of the same creature. From here, one may         venture east into the Seventh and Sixth Century Gallery, (these two galleries         are the Robert and Ren&eacute;e Belfer Court, Phase I of the greater renovation         project), where one is offered a taste of the presentation style that         carries through most of the new galleries: each vitrine is devoted to         a different aspect of Greek life. Clever mixtures of materials (e.g. bronze,         glass, terracotta) and artifacts (e.g. statuettes, drinking cups, plates)         create crosscurrents and interrelationships within and among displays         that not only highlight different aspects of Greek life but also make         the works come alive, offering the viewer an extremely accessible &quot;transversal         cut through the civilization,&quot; according to Philippe de Montebello.         For example, a display of bronze helmets and belly guards creates a dialogue         with a nearby vitrine, which contains three terracotta perfume vases in         the form of helmeted heads. The warriors' eyes steadfastly peek out from         between the bronze flaps-one can envision therefore the usage of the actual         bronze helmets. Exhibit clusters throughout the galleries are devoted         to religion, myth, death and the afterlife, the gods, heroes, and the         symposium. In the Jaharis Gallery is a fascinating group of objects related         to sports and the Panathenaic festivals: large prize amphorae for sacred         olive oil (some decorated with images of footraces), bronze statuettes         of athletes, a marble discos, and even various items associated with post-exercise         cleansing such as a strigil, used by athletes for wiping the skin clean         after cleansing with oil.</font>       <p> <font class="second">The new galleries are organized such that a chronological         tour necessitates crossing back and forth through the central spine, the         magnificent McKim, Mead and White hallway modeled on the Braccio Nuovo         of the Vatican Museum (which itself was modeled on the public baths of         ancient Rome). Following this path, the large statues correspond with         the centuries celebrated in the galleries on either side. Probably one         of the more significant transformations brought about by the renovation         is the alteration of previous traffic patterns. Previously, Museum visitors         on their way to the cafeteria rushed through this hallway, then lined         with Cypriot sculptures, blandly displayed and pushed up against the wall.         Now named the Mary and Michael Jaharis Gallery, the sunlit room is ideal         for exhibiting large scale marble sculpture. Traffic has slowed to a contemplative         stroll, and visitors now linger, taking the time to view these works fully         in the round and admire the changing effects of sunlight on the carved         surfaces. One cannot miss the <i>Statue of a Wounded Warrior</i>, located         practically in the center of the gallery. The unusual stance of the warrior-his         feet are carefully placed on a sloping surface-has provoked various identifications,         including the Greek hero Protesilaos, who ignored an oracle's warning         that the first Greek to step on Trojan soil would be the first to die         in battle.</font></p>      <table width="122" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="dpilso_2.html"><img src="pil2cont.jpg" width="131" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"> <a href="dpilso_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">Exekias,               <i>Black-Figured Neck Amphora with Lid: On Each Side Wedding Procession               in a Chariot</i>.

Beazley, 1927,               27.16. <br>              Photo: Courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</font></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font class="second">The Dietrich von Bothmer Galleries, named for a         longtime curator in the Greek and Roman Department, display a vast array         of sixth and fifth century BC red-figure and black-figure painted pots.         The elegant presentations breathe fresh life into the vases, which were         previously displayed unimaginatively, row upon row, in a dark room on         the second floor of the Museum. Two works by Andokides, set in separate         vitrines but in close proximity, skillfully illustrate the transition         from black-figure to red-figure vase painting. Nearby, a terracotta column         krater painted by Lydos is cleverly juxtaposed with a case containing         pieced-together fragments of another krater decorated by the same artist.         In the second von Bothmer Gallery, the lavishly decorated and dramatic         Euphronios vase creates a striking dialogue with the more understated         Berlin vase, which depicts against a stark background a singer playing         a kithara, a lyre used for the recitation of epic poetry. With its delicate         lines and emphatic silhouette, the Berlin vase is a masterpiece of Greek         vase painting.</font>       <p> <font class="second">To aid the interpretation of the often enigmatic         Greek pots, related materials are presented alongside to convey a much         larger sense of culture. For example, in the Judy and Michael H. Steinhardt         Gallery, a tiny bronze statuette of a horse shares a case with a terracotta         neck-amphora decorated with a painted chariot drawn by four horses. Another         vitrine focuses on a single artist, illustrating one of the many laborious         tasks of archeologists: isolating a particular artistic hand from so many         others. Here, a group of works by the Amasis painter illustrate the artist's         wide range of subjects, which includes an imaginative rendering of Poseidon's         underwater stables described in the Iliad, as well as vignettes of everyday         life such as a woman working a loom.</font>       <p> <font class="second">In order to comprehend the rationale behind the         presentations, as well as to appreciate fully each artifact, multiple         visits to these galleries are necessary. Particular objects not to be         missed include a pelican's foot shell used for pouring a burial libation,         located in the Weiner Gallery. Perhaps the most delicate object in the         entire collection, the carved marble is so thin it is virtually translucent.         Another startling discovery located nearby is the set of larger-than-life-size         eyes from a lost bronze statue. Eerie yet stunning, the eyes are composed         of bronze, marble, frit, quartz, and obsidian, and are carefully created         with each iris and pupil ringed with eyelashes. Perhaps the most poignant         object can be found among the Museums' monumental collection of stone         funeral reliefs: a skillfully carved Parian marble grave stele that depicts         a young girl clutching her pet doves, solemnly kissing one on the beak.         The <i>New York Kouros</i> in the Michael Steinhardt gallery is one of         the earliest marble statues of a human figure carved in Attica. Intended         to mark the grave of a young Athenian aristocrat, the Kouros stands rigidly,         in a pose derived from Egyptian art. A terracotta volute krater in the         Stavros and Dana‘ Costopoulos Gallery is striking in its architectonic         character. The staid vertical ribbing of the body contrasts with the lively         and exquisitely detailed crowning frieze that depicts the frolicking Dionysos         and his retinue.</font>       <p> <font class="second">One quibble with the presentation in the new galleries         discussed by Gary Wills in <i>The New York Review of Books</i> (June 10,         1999) is the mere passing glance at the role of women, slavery, and homosexuality         in Greek life. While war, sports, religion, and myth are fascinating and         offer a wealth of interrelationships between objects, Wills thought that         perhaps more could have been done to reflect these current and hotly debated         topics. From exploring the galleries, however, it seems evident that the         curators have seriously pondered the particular strengths of what is essentially         a conservative collection. While the objects might include illustrations         of such subjects as homosexuality or slaver, they do not necessarily lend         themselves to in-depth qualitative or quantitative inquiries. The thematic         groupings are didactic and extremely educational, yet they are not meant         to be dramatically pioneering.</font>       <p> <font class="second">Overall, the new galleries reward many levels of         inquiry. The casual visitor can wander through the galleries, investigating         objects that catch the eye. The addition of four doors leading into the         main hall enable a variety of itineraries, including one that adheres         to a strict chronology. Abundant explanatory wall texts, maps, and object         labels provide a wealth of information. The objects themselves, through         their groupings and juxtapositions, provoke contemplation, and encourage         the visitor to form opinions and draw further conclusions. The didactic         presentation stimulates the casual viewer, provides further information         for those with a stronger background in the field, and offers novel and         fresh ways of approaching the material for scholars and specialists. A         deeply satisfying experience on any level.</font>       <p> <font class="second"><i>Postscript</i>: In April, 2000, The Metropolitan         Museum of Art opened the new Cypriot galleries, which display major works         from the Cesnola Collection, formed by Luigi Palma di Cesnola (1832-1904),         who became American consul on Cyprus in 1865. After excavating there for         over a decade, in 1872 he sold his collection to The Metropolitan Museum         of Art, and seven years later became the Museum's first director. Issues         of cultural patrimony aside, it is the most significant collection of         ancient Cypriot art outside of Cyprus. The four new galleries trace the         chronological development of Cypriot art through a selection of works         from the Cesnola Collection, which covers a time span from about 2500         BC until about 300 AD.</font>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="1">&copy;         2000 Part and Dana Pilson.
