Recent group and monographic shows               highlighting works on paper by Gordon Matta-Clark, Eva Hesse, Sol               Lewitt, Nancy Holt and Robert Smithson attest to both the richness               of this material and the current appetite for it.<sup><small>1</small></sup>               No one in this community of artists exploited the permeable boundaries               between two and three dimensions, or dialectical relationships between               words, images and objects, as thoroughly as Robert Smithson. </font></P>            <table width="150" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rclark_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="clk1cont.jpg" width="150" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="rclark_1.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     <i>No Vacancy</i>, 1962 Ink on paper, 24 x 18 inches.

It served as an important complement               to the shows mentioned above, some of which dealt with Smithson's               better-known work in minimal and process-oriented idioms from the               later 1960s. The Cohan Gallery show reopens provocative questions               posed in the last decade by scholars including Caroline Jones and               Eugenie Tsai. How should we read Smithson's text-emblazoned drawings               and collages from the early 1960s? And what relationship might this               work (which was later rejected by Smithson and critics alike as               juvenilia) have to his tremendously influential production during               the later 1960s and early 1970s? <sup><small>2</small></sup></font></P>            <P><font class="second">A majority of the works displayed in the Cohan               Gallery show are free hand ink drawings that foreground an interplay               between text and cartoon-like images. The simultaneously hieroglyphic,               pictographic, and phonetic possibilities of words as material are               explored in works such as <i>No Vacancy</i>, 1962. The title phrase               of this drawing is rendered in an overwrought schoolboy script,               while the tawdry pleasures imagined within are described by the               word "VASELINE" exclaimed 52 times on the top third of the sheet.               Compulsive repetition as ritual and ornament play out in a grid               of 11 x 26 5-pointed stars, and in the form of an expressionless               female nude, outlined by the text "butter on velvet," repeated five               times below. Smithson's proclivity for marrying banal and apocalyptic               themes during this period is demonstrated by the incantation "Price               War Last Day" inscribed like a doomsday pediment across the bottom               of the page. </font></P>            <table width="150" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rclark_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="clk2cont.jpg" width="150" height="199" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"> <a href="rclark_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>St.                     John in the Desert</i>, c. 1961-63 Watercolor, diagrams and                     photo collage on paper, 24 x 18 inches.<br>                    Estate of Robert Smithson Courtesy James Cohan Gallery, New                     York.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <P><font class="second">Of the 31 works on paper included in the exhibition,               six of the densest and most complex pieces are collages. Tension               between center and periphery, a dynamic later developed more rigorously               in Smithson's theory of site and nonsite, is humorously explored               in <i>St. John in the Desert, c. 1961-63</i>. At multiple removes               from its source, the central image is a cut-out mechanical reproduction               of an etching after Raphael, representing a scantily clad boy in               leopard skin. This winsome St. John is surrounded by diagrams of               cathode resistors, audio output recorders, and various types of               circuits apparently clipped from a user's manual. The text in these               diagrams is rife with organic/mechanical metaphor -- "good fuse,               bad fuse" -- and advice of dubious value to St. John -- "how we               put a magnetic field on tape." Technical drawings engulf Raphael's               mage like improbable marginalia; clearly neither can explain the               other, yet in their absurdity both the saint and the gadgets are               presented as objects of desire. </font>             <P><font class="second">The exhibition title, "Language to be Looked               at and/or Things to be Read," was lifted from a Dwan Gallery press               release drafted by Smithson (under the pseudonym Eton Corrasable)               in 1967. The drawing that accompanied that press release (<i>A Heap               of Language</i>, 1966) was not included in the Cohan Gallery show,               but Smithson's published work from that period was represented by               the inclusion of two magazine articles displayed in a vitrine.<sup><small>3</small></sup>               Both of these works, as examples of Smithson's polemic ruminations               on art and history, reward sustained attention beyond the </font>             <table width="125" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rclark_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="clk3cont.jpg" width="125" height="213" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="rclark_3.html" target="_blank">                     <font class="sixth"><i>Conch Shell Spaceship and Word Land                     Mass</i>, c. 1961-63 Gouache, crayon,and photocollage on paper,                     24 x 18 inches.<br>                    Estate of Robert Smithson Courtesy James Cohan Gallery, New                     York, Private Collection.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <font class="second">scope of this review. However, the most persuasive             argument in the show for connections between Smithson's early drawings             and his later three-dimensional works is perhaps to be found in another             collage, <i>Conch Shell Spaceship and Word Land Mass, 1961-63</i>.             Three quarters of this vertically-oriented work is populated with             a proliferation of nouns and proper names -- "Gorgon," "OHARA," "things,"             "Lyme" -- scrawled in crayon which has been overwashed with black             gouache. Figure and ground struggle for dominance in this "word land             mass." The text, rendered in oil crayon, repels the water-based gouache,             but where the crayon line is thin it is overwhelmed by dark painted             pigment so that the text is in turn sublimated. The inversion of figure             and ground, the elision of words and matter (or the emergence of words             as matter), and the science fiction elements of <i>Conch Shell Spaceship             and Word Land Mass</i> are themes fruitfully explored in Smithson's             later work, such as <i>Spiral Jetty</i>, 1970. Variously realized             as a monumental earthwork, an experimental film, a parodic essay,             and sheaves of drawings ranging from rough concept sketches to carefully             scaled engineering plans, <i>Spiral Jetty</i> may seem too elaborate             a project to compare to this humble collage. Yet, rather than positing             a simple causal relationship between the drawings and collages from             1961-63 and works in three dimensions from 1966-1973, the works in             this exhibition provide an opportunity to examine Smithson's preliminary             forays into a thicket of complex ideas. While affinities between the             early collages and drawings and Smithson's later projects are intriguing,             these works even more telling as evidence of what he left behind in             the construction of his mature, self-described oeuvre.</font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="rclark_ref.html">References&gt;&gt;</a></font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="rclark_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font>           </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Robin Clark.
