At best these volumes often should be consulted             only when one desires information on a specific work or art or its             artist at a given moment. Never before have I found such a catalogue             with which one can curl up on the couch (the place where I do most             of my reading and writing, the scholarly and not-so-scholarly work).             These books are usually cumbersome and laden with archival minutiae             so mind-numbing that the clutches of boredom seem to bring upon the             reader a sleep similar to death, its hold one fights to be released             but cannot escape. This was, however, by no means the case with one             of the most significant publications on sculpture to be recently published,             a text entitled <i>American Sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of             Art: Volume I. A Catalogue of Works by Artists Born before 1865</i>,             edited by Thayer Tolles, assistant curator in the Metropolitan Museum's             department of American Painting and Sculpture, and with catalogue             entries by Lauretta Dimmick (an independent scholar), Donna J. Hassler             (Executive Director of the Rensselaer County Historical Society in             Troy, New York), and Tolles.</font>            </p>            <p><font class="second">This book, the first of two volumes, was published             in late 1999 (available at the Metropolitan and its on-line gift shop             on its <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org" target="_blank">website</a>)             and begins with a history of the Metropolitan Museum's American Sculpture             Collection. The first American sculpture to enter the museum's collection             was in 1872, Hiram Powers's <i>California</i>, as a gift from W.A.             Astor. In fact, according to Tolles's informative essay on the Collection's             history, all of the Metropolitan's American Sculpture entering the             collection before 1905 was acquired by gift. One also learns through             the reading of this essay the vast role played by Daniel Chester French             between the years of 1903 and 1931, when he was a trustee at the Metropolitan             and the main collector of American sculpture for the museum during             those years. (Artists' roles in helping to build particular collections             is extremely interesting and to my knowledge is a vastly understudied             phenomena. Yet the Metropolitan has pointed out in recent years another             important artist who helped to form a collection they later acquired             by gift, that being the Havemeyer collection, built in large part             on the advice of the American painter Mary Cassatt).</font>            </p>            <p><font class="second">The catalogue is organized chronologically by             the year of the artist's birth, then alphabetically when more than             one artist was born in the same year. It begins with the earliest             modern American sculptor, Horatio Greenough, born in 1805, and ending             with Charles Marion Russell, born in 1864. Between these two are included             some of the most significant sculptors of the nineteenth century:             Henry Kirke Brown, Thomas Crawford, Daniel Chester French, William             Morris Hunt, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Some may find the organization             of the book confusing, especially if one is not an Americanist and/or             is unfamiliar with the year of the birth of the artists they are looking             for; but the index of artists and titles cures this easily and quickly.             Each entry contains a short selected biography on the artist, which             is then followed with a brief bibliography for that artist. Following             this one finds the entries for each specific sculpture by that artist             in the Metropolitan's collection, beginning with the earliest. The             entries are intelligent and scholarly and contain a brief exhibition             history for each sculpture (after its entry into the Met's collection)             and informative endnotes in most cases. Jerry L. Thompson's photographs,             incorporated for each object and which include many in color, are             quite exquisite; they are in and of themselves a valuable resource,             equally as useful as the written entries within the text. The book             concludes with a selected bibliography, a list of catalogue numbers             with their corresponding accession numbers (useful for researchers),             and the index. </font>            </p>            <p><font class="second">Although my criticisms of the text are few, there             are two items that I feel compelled to mention. First, the selected             bibliography, although tight and succinct, fails to list a number             of general books on sculpture which are of major importance to the             medium's history. Missing among them is Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr.s'             <i>The Lure of Italy: American Artists and the Italian Experience,             1760-1914</i> (1992), which contains substantial essays on the importance             of Rome for sculptors during the nineteenth-century. (Stebbins' book             is mentioned in a footnote within one of the entries, but I think             it is important enough to have been included it in the back, lest             it be otherwise missed.) Various general books on the medium itself             would have been helpful to a reader unfamiliar with various technical             processes and terms; Malvina Hoffman's <i>Sculpture Inside and Out</i>             (1939) is still a useful and widely cited text on technique that could             have been listed and was not. Kirk Savage's <i>Standing Soldiers,             Kneeling Slaves</i> (1997) is also absent from the selected bibliography,             and this is unfortunate because although the text deals mainly with             public monuments, many American sculptors born before 1865 are discussed             in depth within its pages. However, the select bibliography, I am             sure, was kept short as to not repeat many of the texts listed after             the biographies for each artist, (as with the Stebbins) which are             often informative and lead the reader to other important texts about             each artist and his/her work. </font>            </p>            <p><font class="second">Secondly, oftentimes collection catalogues             tend to illustrate, obviously without trying to do so, various holes             or gaps in the collection's holdings. This is certainly not a criticism             of the catalogue itself, but I found it interesting how few works             by women sculptors born before 1865 the Metropolitan actually holds.             Of the 61 sculptors included in the catalogue, only two are women:             Harriet Goodhue Hosmer (1830-1908) and Adelaide Johnson (1859-1955).             This seems to perpetuate the gravely incorrect idea that women artists             were not making sculpture in the nineteenth century, when in fact             they had an important history involving struggle and success. Thus             an entire significant portion of American sculpture history, the contribution             of women sculptors, is missing. Artists such as Anne Whitney, Mary             Edmonia Lewis, Louisa Lander, Emma Stebbins, Vinnie Ream Hoxie, Margaret             Foley, Blanche Nevin, and countless others born before 1865, whose             work was an important part of vast, rich history of American neoclassical             sculpture, were not collected. Obviously this is not the fault of             the authors of the text; it is simply a reminder of the history of             collecting in America during a particular time period - work by women             was just not being actively collected by any museums in the first             half of the twentieth century, and the book seems to blatantly remind             some of us of that fact without really wanting to do so. (One can             only dream that maybe someday in the future works by such sculptors             will come up for purchase and the Met will seek to acquire them.)</font>            </p>            <p><font class="second">Yet the upside of collection catalogues is that many under-appreciated             jewels of the collection are brought together with the more famous             works. Works such as J. Stanley Connor's <i>Cain</i> (text pages 369-70),             a wonderful marble which can be found in the Luce Center cases on             the second floor of the museum (the Met's &quot;art zoo&quot; as such             organization of works behind glass on shelves is often affectionately             referred,) is wonderfully photographed by Thompson and given an excellent             entry by Tolles. She had little information to work with, as not even             Connor's year of birth is concretely known, but was able to make certain             to the reader the effectiveness of this relatively unknown artist's             work. Although John Quincy Adams Ward, then a museum trustee, found             the work disagreeable in subject (being an image of the first human             murderer), it was accepted as a gift from Conner's mother in 1883.             Tolles notes that the work is a testament to &quot;·a new strain of             emotion in sculpture not incompatible with the Victorian penchant             for overwrought drama.&quot; (p. 370) Certainly a sculptor who was             this accomplished, who could draw out from a block of stone this level             of expression and emotion, deserves to be sought out and discussed             and Tolles entry, like many of the others by her co-authors Dimmick             and Hassler, leaves the reader's appetite whetted.</font>            </p>            <font class="second"><p>Rarely can a catalogue of a museum's collection             be read with real interest. Thayer Tolles' <i>American Sculpture in             the Metropolitan Museum of Art: Volume I. A Catalogue of Works by             Artists Born before 1865</i>, is a welcome exception. The book is             insightful, clear, concise, beautifully designed, useful to researchers             and above all readable, as few such catalogues tend to be. The text             is necessary reading for any scholar of nineteenth century sculpture             and a necessary addition to any sculpture library. Volume two, currently             entitled <i>A Catalogue of Works by Artists Born Between 1865 and             1885</i> and due to be published in 2000, promises to be equally stunning.             I, for one, remain on the couch eagerly awaiting this second volume.</font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="cpierr_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font>           </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Caterina Pierre.
