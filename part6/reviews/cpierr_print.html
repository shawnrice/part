At best these volumes often should be consulted only when one         desires information on a specific work or art or its artist at a given         moment. Never before have I found such a catalogue with which one can         curl up on the couch (the place where I do most of my reading and writing,         the scholarly and not-so-scholarly work). These books are usually cumbersome         and laden with archival minutiae so mind-numbing that the clutches of         boredom seem to bring upon the reader a sleep similar to death, its hold         one fights to be released but cannot escape. This was, however, by no         means the case with one of the most significant publications on sculpture         to be recently published, a text entitled <i>American Sculpture in the         Metropolitan Museum of Art: Volume I. A Catalogue of Works by Artists         Born before 1865</i>, edited by Thayer Tolles, assistant curator in the         Metropolitan Museum's department of American Painting and Sculpture, and         with catalogue entries by Lauretta Dimmick (an independent scholar), Donna         J. Hassler (Executive Director of the Rensselaer County Historical Society         in Troy, New York), and Tolles.</font> </p>      <p><font class="second">This book, the first of two volumes, was published         in late 1999 (available at the Metropolitan and its on-line gift shop         on its <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org" target="_blank">website</a>)         and begins with a history of the Metropolitan Museum's American Sculpture         Collection. The first American sculpture to enter the museum's collection         was in 1872, Hiram Powers's <i>California</i>, as a gift from W.A. Astor.         In fact, according to Tolles's informative essay on the Collection's history,         all of the Metropolitan's American Sculpture entering the collection before         1905 was acquired by gift. One also learns through the reading of this         essay the vast role played by Daniel Chester French between the years         of 1903 and 1931, when he was a trustee at the Metropolitan and the main         collector of American sculpture for the museum during those years. (Artists'         roles in helping to build particular collections is extremely interesting         and to my knowledge is a vastly understudied phenomena. Yet the Metropolitan         has pointed out in recent years another important artist who helped to         form a collection they later acquired by gift, that being the Havemeyer         collection, built in large part on the advice of the American painter         Mary Cassatt).</font> </p>      <p><font class="second">The catalogue is organized chronologically by the         year of the artist's birth, then alphabetically when more than one artist         was born in the same year. It begins with the earliest modern American         sculptor, Horatio Greenough, born in 1805, and ending with Charles Marion         Russell, born in 1864. Between these two are included some of the most         significant sculptors of the nineteenth century: Henry Kirke Brown, Thomas         Crawford, Daniel Chester French, William Morris Hunt, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.         Some may find the organization of the book confusing, especially if one         is not an Americanist and/or is unfamiliar with the year of the birth         of the artists they are looking for; but the index of artists and titles         cures this easily and quickly. Each entry contains a short selected biography         on the artist, which is then followed with a brief bibliography for that         artist. Following this one finds the entries for each specific sculpture         by that artist in the Metropolitan's collection, beginning with the earliest.         The entries are intelligent and scholarly and contain a brief exhibition         history for each sculpture (after its entry into the Met's collection)         and informative endnotes in most cases. Jerry L. Thompson's photographs,         incorporated for each object and which include many in color, are quite         exquisite; they are in and of themselves a valuable resource, equally         as useful as the written entries within the text. The book concludes with         a selected bibliography, a list of catalogue numbers with their corresponding         accession numbers (useful for researchers), and the index. </font> </p>      <p><font class="second">Although my criticisms of the text are few, there         are two items that I feel compelled to mention. First, the selected bibliography,         although tight and succinct, fails to list a number of general books on         sculpture which are of major importance to the medium's history. Missing         among them is Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr.s' <i>The Lure of Italy: American         Artists and the Italian Experience, 1760-1914</i> (1992), which contains         substantial essays on the importance of Rome for sculptors during the         nineteenth-century. (Stebbins' book is mentioned in a footnote within         one of the entries, but I think it is important enough to have been included         it in the back, lest it be otherwise missed.) Various general books on         the medium itself would have been helpful to a reader unfamiliar with         various technical processes and terms; Malvina Hoffman's <i>Sculpture         Inside and Out</i> (1939) is still a useful and widely cited text on technique         that could have been listed and was not. Kirk Savage's <i>Standing Soldiers,         Kneeling Slaves</i> (1997) is also absent from the selected bibliography,         and this is unfortunate because although the text deals mainly with public         monuments, many American sculptors born before 1865 are discussed in depth         within its pages. However, the select bibliography, I am sure, was kept         short as to not repeat many of the texts listed after the biographies         for each artist, (as with the Stebbins) which are often informative and         lead the reader to other important texts about each artist and his/her         work. </font> </p>      <p><font class="second">Secondly, oftentimes collection catalogues tend         to illustrate, obviously without trying to do so, various holes or gaps         in the collection's holdings. This is certainly not a criticism of the         catalogue itself, but I found it interesting how few works by women sculptors         born before 1865 the Metropolitan actually holds. Of the 61 sculptors         included in the catalogue, only two are women: Harriet Goodhue Hosmer         (1830-1908) and Adelaide Johnson (1859-1955). This seems to perpetuate         the gravely incorrect idea that women artists were not making sculpture         in the nineteenth century, when in fact they had an important history         involving struggle and success. Thus an entire significant portion of         American sculpture history, the contribution of women sculptors, is missing.         Artists such as Anne Whitney, Mary Edmonia Lewis, Louisa Lander, Emma         Stebbins, Vinnie Ream Hoxie, Margaret Foley, Blanche Nevin, and countless         others born before 1865, whose work was an important part of vast, rich         history of American neoclassical sculpture, were not collected. Obviously         this is not the fault of the authors of the text; it is simply a reminder         of the history of collecting in America during a particular time period         - work by women was just not being actively collected by any museums in         the first half of the twentieth century, and the book seems to blatantly         remind some of us of that fact without really wanting to do so. (One can         only dream that maybe someday in the future works by such sculptors will         come up for purchase and the Met will seek to acquire them.)</font> </p>      <p><font class="second">Yet the upside of collection catalogues is that         many under-appreciated jewels of the collection are brought together with         the more famous works. Works such as J. Stanley Connor's <i>Cain</i> (text         pages 369-70), a wonderful marble which can be found in the Luce Center         cases on the second floor of the museum (the Met's &quot;art zoo&quot;         as such organization of works behind glass on shelves is often affectionately         referred,) is wonderfully photographed by Thompson and given an excellent         entry by Tolles. She had little information to work with, as not even         Connor's year of birth is concretely known, but was able to make certain         to the reader the effectiveness of this relatively unknown artist's work.         Although John Quincy Adams Ward, then a museum trustee, found the work         disagreeable in subject (being an image of the first human murderer),         it was accepted as a gift from Conner's mother in 1883. Tolles notes that         the work is a testament to &quot;·a new strain of emotion in sculpture         not incompatible with the Victorian penchant for overwrought drama.&quot;         (p. 370) Certainly a sculptor who was this accomplished, who could draw         out from a block of stone this level of expression and emotion, deserves         to be sought out and discussed and Tolles entry, like many of the others         by her co-authors Dimmick and Hassler, leaves the reader's appetite whetted.</font>       </p>      <p><font class="second">Rarely can a catalogue of a museum's collection         be read with real interest. Thayer Tolles' <i>American Sculpture in the         Metropolitan Museum of Art: Volume I. A Catalogue of Works by Artists         Born before 1865</i>, is a welcome exception. The book is insightful,         clear, concise, beautifully designed, useful to researchers and above         all readable, as few such catalogues tend to be. The text is necessary         reading for any scholar of nineteenth century sculpture and a necessary         addition to any sculpture library. Volume two, currently entitled <i>A         Catalogue of Works by Artists Born Between 1865 and 1885</i> and due to         be published in 2000, promises to be equally stunning. I, for one, remain         on the couch eagerly awaiting this second volume</font>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="1">&copy;         2000 Part and Robin Clark.
