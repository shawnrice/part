Recent group and monographic shows highlighting works         on paper by Gordon Matta-Clark, Eva Hesse, Sol Lewitt, Nancy Holt and         Robert Smithson attest to both the richness of this material and the current         appetite for it.<sup><small>1</small></sup> No one in this community of         artists exploited the permeable boundaries between two and three dimensions,         or dialectical relationships between words, images and objects, as thoroughly         as Robert Smithson. </font></p>      <table width="150" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="rclark_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="clk1cont.jpg" width="150" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="rclark_1.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               <i>No Vacancy</i>, 1962 Ink on paper, 24 x 18 inches.

It served as an important complement to the shows mentioned         above, some of which dealt with Smithson's better-known work in minimal         and process-oriented idioms from the later 1960s. The Cohan Gallery show         reopens provocative questions posed in the last decade by scholars including         Caroline Jones and Eugenie Tsai. How should we read Smithson's text-emblazoned         drawings and collages from the early 1960s? And what relationship might         this work (which was later rejected by Smithson and critics alike as juvenilia)         have to his tremendously influential production during the later 1960s         and early 1970s? <sup><small>2</small></sup></font></p>      <p><font class="second">A majority of the works displayed in the Cohan Gallery         show are free hand ink drawings that foreground an interplay between text         and cartoon-like images. The simultaneously hieroglyphic, pictographic,         and phonetic possibilities of words as material are explored in works         such as <i>No Vacancy</i>, 1962. The title phrase of this drawing is rendered         in an overwrought schoolboy script, while the tawdry pleasures imagined         within are described by the word "VASELINE" exclaimed 52 times on the         top third of the sheet. Compulsive repetition as ritual and ornament play         out in a grid of 11 x 26 5-pointed stars, and in the form of an expressionless         female nude, outlined by the text "butter on velvet," repeated five times         below. Smithson's proclivity for marrying banal and apocalyptic themes         during this period is demonstrated by the incantation "Price War Last         Day" inscribed like a doomsday pediment across the bottom of the page.         </font></p>      <table width="150" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="rclark_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="clk2cont.jpg" width="150" height="199" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"> <a href="rclark_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>St.               John in the Desert</i>, c. 1961-63 Watercolor, diagrams and photo               collage on paper, 24 x 18 inches.<br>              Estate of Robert Smithson Courtesy James Cohan Gallery, New York.</font></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font class="second">Of the 31 works on paper included in the exhibition,         six of the densest and most complex pieces are collages. Tension between         center and periphery, a dynamic later developed more rigorously in Smithson's         theory of site and nonsite, is humorously explored in <i>St. John in the         Desert, c. 1961-63</i>. At multiple removes from its source, the central         image is a cut-out mechanical reproduction of an etching after Raphael,         representing a scantily clad boy in leopard skin. This winsome St. John         is surrounded by diagrams of cathode resistors, audio output recorders,         and various types of circuits apparently clipped from a user's manual.         The text in these diagrams is rife with organic/mechanical metaphor --         "good fuse, bad fuse" -- and advice of dubious value to St. John -- "how         we put a magnetic field on tape." Technical drawings engulf Raphael's         mage like improbable marginalia; clearly neither can explain the other,         yet in their absurdity both the saint and the gadgets are presented as         objects of desire. </font>       <p><font class="second">The exhibition title, "Language to be Looked at         and/or Things to be Read," was lifted from a Dwan Gallery press release         drafted by Smithson (under the pseudonym Eton Corrasable) in 1967. The         drawing that accompanied that press release (<i>A Heap of Language</i>,         1966) was not included in the Cohan Gallery show, but Smithson's published         work from that period was represented by the inclusion of two magazine         articles displayed in a vitrine.<sup><small>3</small></sup> Both of these         works, as examples of Smithson's polemic ruminations on art and history,         reward sustained attention beyond the </font>       <table width="125" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="rclark_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="clk3cont.jpg" width="125" height="213" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="rclark_3.html" target="_blank"> <font class="sixth"><i>Conch               Shell Spaceship and Word Land Mass</i>, c. 1961-63 Gouache, crayon,and               photocollage on paper, 24 x 18 inches.<br>              Estate of Robert Smithson Courtesy James Cohan Gallery, New York,               Private Collection.</font></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <font class="second">scope of this review. However, the most persuasive       argument in the show for connections between Smithson's early drawings and       his later three-dimensional works is perhaps to be found in another collage,       <i>Conch Shell Spaceship and Word Land Mass, 1961-63</i>. Three quarters       of this vertically-oriented work is populated with a proliferation of nouns       and proper names -- "Gorgon," "OHARA," "things," "Lyme" -- scrawled in crayon       which has been overwashed with black gouache. Figure and ground struggle       for dominance in this "word land mass." The text, rendered in oil crayon,       repels the water-based gouache, but where the crayon line is thin it is       overwhelmed by dark painted pigment so that the text is in turn sublimated.       The inversion of figure and ground, the elision of words and matter (or       the emergence of words as matter), and the science fiction elements of <i>Conch       Shell Spaceship and Word Land Mass</i> are themes fruitfully explored in       Smithson's later work, such as <i>Spiral Jetty</i>, 1970. Variously realized       as a monumental earthwork, an experimental film, a parodic essay, and sheaves       of drawings ranging from rough concept sketches to carefully scaled engineering       plans, <i>Spiral Jetty</i> may seem too elaborate a project to compare to       this humble collage. Yet, rather than positing a simple causal relationship       between the drawings and collages from 1961-63 and works in three dimensions       from 1966-1973, the works in this exhibition provide an opportunity to examine       Smithson's preliminary forays into a thicket of complex ideas. While affinities       between the early collages and drawings and Smithson's later projects are       intriguing, these works even more telling as evidence of what he left behind       in the construction of his mature, self-described oeuvre.</font>       <p>&nbsp; </p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="1">&copy;         2000 Part and Robin Clark.
