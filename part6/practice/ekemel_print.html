Instead it is in the form of &quot;notes&quot; and thoughts brought         together from information gathered over the course of the last two months.         Since it was not my intention to write a paper that would have a clear-cut         thesis or present a fully-researched topic, I decided to experiment with         this format. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">I begin by relaying how I came across and learned         of the monument, The Hall of Fame for Great Americans at Bronx Community         College. This is followed by background information on the history and         sculptors of The Hall of Fame. I choose to reprint an article that I wrote         this summer, rather than weave it in with more specific ideas and issues.         I continue by discussing what I didn't mention in the article, mainly         focusing on the lack of scholarship on the subject. Further, I examine         the characteristics that identify The Hall of Fame as an American Renaissance         monument and I conclude with a brief update on its current condition and         financial state</font></p>      <p><font class="second">In presenting my research as I have in this paper,         I hope to fulfill my secondary aim to broaden the possibilities of disseminating         information by challenging the traditional forms of style and methodology         in scholarship. I feel that online writing may be more flexible, if the         venue allows, in this case an online art history journal aimed for an         audience of graduate students. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">My hope is that these notes might stimulate further         discussion and research of the subject and generate online feedback that         might be helpful for interested scholars or other writers. </font></p>      <p>       At the end I provide sources and documentation notes, a smmary of related       online sites, and a list of sculptors and their portrait busts.       <p><font class="second">I have included within the text photographs that         I took on the premises. May I suggest that you look at the following site         <a href="http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/hallofFame" target="_blank"> http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/hallofFame</a>         which offers both a &quot;Photo Gallery&quot; and a &quot;Virtual Reality         Scene&quot; with a zoom in and out feature. Also, there are a few worthwhile         photos at <a href="http://www.forgottenny.com/STREETSCENES/HallOfFame/hallfame.htm" target="_blank">         http://www.forgottenny.com/STREETSCENES/HallOf20Fame/hallfame.htm</a>.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>How I came across the subject:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">In the beginning of the summer, I was given a folder         of information, mostly secondary sources, on The Hall of Fame for Great         Americans and asked by the editor to write an article of a few pages for         the <i>National Sculpture Society News Bulletin</i>, the newsletter of         the National Sculpture Society. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The subject was not wholly new to me, that is I         had actually visited this monument a few years back. I also recalled that         I did at some point in graduate school want to research the topic. The         truth is I couldn't remember at that moment if the work was located at         Lehman College or Bronx Community College. But I knew it was in the Bronx         and on a City University of New York college campus. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">It was later in the day that I went through the         events in my mind on how I came across this monument. I was applying to         the graduate art history program at The Graduate Center of The City University         of New York (CUNY) and for some reason, I think a friend suggested it,         I should include a dissertation topic that I might pursue if accepted.         Having an interest in public sculpture, but not being too clear on what         a dissertation entails, I came up with the enormous proposal of art on         CUNY campuses. I got my camera, my notes and tokens (before Metrocard         days) and headed, over the course of a few days, from one CUNY campus         to another. I think I started out in Kingsborough Community College, which         is the closest CUNY to me and ventured as far as Bronx Community College.         There, at BCC, coming across by mere chance, I discovered, or at least         I thought I discovered, a lost treasure. That was how I came to know of         The Hall of Fame for Great Americans. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Yet, even after having visited The Hall of Fame         a few years back and having heard in a graduate school course that it         still exists quietly in the Bronx, I remained in a quandary of what it         was and how it came to be. </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>What is The Hall of Fame for Great Americans:         </b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">In considering this question and how to bring together         factual information with other issues and concerns, I decided to reprint         here, with a few changes and omissions, the article that I wrote for the         <i>National Sculpture Society News Bulletin</i> (published August -September         2000). This article was written for an audience of National Sculpture         Society members, particularly its sculptor members. My interest in the         National Sculpture Society - the first professional organization for sculptors         in America (founded 1893) - stems back a few years, having done an internship         there. I am also currently writing and researching my dissertation, &quot;The         Professionalization of Sculptors in America: the Origins of the National         Sculpture Society.&quot; Having established some background information         here, I follow by discussing what wasn't included in the article. </font></p>      <table width="200" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="ekemel_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="kem4cont.jpg" width="200" height="132" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="ekemel_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">Semi-circular               colonnade, Hall of Fame for Great Americans, Bronx Community College.               <br>              Photo by Elena Kemelman. </font></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font class="second">The Hall of Fame for Great Americans approaching         the one-hundredth anniversary of its official dedication date of May 30,         1901 (built 1900-1901) is a formidable work of art and architecture, and         is America's first hall of fame. It honors American men and women of distinction         in the fields of science, art, literature, religion, education, business,         government and social and economic reform. Chosen in elections held over         the course of seventy-six years (1900-1976), nearly one-hundred Americans         are represented by individual life-like portrait busts installed within         an open-air colonnaded terrace known as The Hall of Fame for Great Americans.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The 630 feet long semi-circular colonnade, along         with its three adjacent Beaux-Arts style buildings (The Gould Memorial         Library, the Halls of Philosophy and Languages) was designed by Stanford         White, architect of the Washington Memorial Arch in New York's Washington         Square Park, among many other important public and private works. The         terrace with its curving form was designed by the architect to set off         the rigidity of its landscape. The idea of turning the structure into         a hall of fame that would serve an educational purpose was conceived by         Henry M. MacCracken, Chancellor of New York University (1891-1910). </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Once the uptown campus of New York University, the         grounds on which The Hall of Fame is located was ceded to Bronx Community         College in 1973; the campus is located at University Avenue and West 181st         Street. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The terrace and its cluster of buildings stand &quot;on         the highest natural point in New York City&quot; overlooking the New Jersey         Palisades and the Harlem and Hudson Rivers. The site holds a special place         in the history of the American Revolution, when it was used as a British         fort. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Following years of disregard and bad publicity,         it has received positive print, television, and magazine coverage over         the last decade. Yet in spite of the renewed popular interest in this         &quot;National Pantheon&quot; - which has been listed on the National         Register of Historic Places since February 1966 - the nearly six dozen         sculptors and the bronze busts they created have received little attention.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">All together 102 niches contain 98 busts executed         by a total of 55 sculptors. Four niches remain empty, with the busts of         the four honorees yet to be installed since their 1970s elections. Thanks         to restoration work done in the 1980s and early 1990s, both the busts         and the terrace are in good condition. Underneath each bust is a long         horizontal bronze tablet, inscribed with the honoree's name, dates of         birth and death and a quote or in the case of two composers, the clever         choice of musical scores instead of words. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Since sculptors were asked to contribute a work         made expressly for The Hall of Fame, all but nine busts, which are replicas,         are original to the monument. The dates of execution of original busts         range from the early 1920s to the late 1970s. In light of the fact that         candidates for election were only eligible to be nominated after their         deaths (a designated number of years), the sculptors would have presumably         had to turn to pictorial or plastic sources for inspiration. In spite         of this disadvantage, and a credit to them, the sculptors overall endowed         their subjects with dignity and humility, a sense of naturalism and personality.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">An added attraction is the replica bust of Jean-Antoine         Houdon's <i>Marquis de Lafayette</i>, separately chosen in way of honoring         his role in the American Revolution. The bust is located in an exterior         wall niche of the centrally connected building, the domed Gould Memorial         Library, originally named in memory of Jay Gould, the railroad tycoon         and father of The Hall of Fame's first financial donor, Helen Miller Gould         Shepard. Houdon's work is also represented in his replicas of <i>George         Washington</i> (the only subject to receive unanimous votes, elected 1900)         and Robert Fulton (elected 1900), both part of the colonnade group of         98 portraits. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">There are fourteen works, including both male and         female subjects, by eleven women sculptors. Women candidates were eligible         from the first election in 1900, thought it was not until the second election,         five years later, with the inclusion of three female inductees, that women         were represented on the list of great Americans. By 1922, a total of eight         women were selected, and the original 1914 plan to separate women honorees         in their own &quot;Hall of Fame for Women&quot; within the colonnade was         abandoned. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">As a group, the 98 busts form an important and impressive         collection of American portrait sculpture in bronze and have been noted         to be &quot;the largest and finest collection of bronze busts anywhere         in our country.&quot; Of the 55 sculptors, all are considered American         sculptors or are distinguished for their contribution to American sculpture.         The latter applies to the Italian Giuseppe Ceracchi, who visited the U.S.         in the 1790s, and France's finest eighteenth century sculptor, Jean Antoine         Houdon, who modeled George Washington from life in his Mount Vernon estate.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Notably, since almost three-quarters of the 55 sculptors         can be identified as having been members of the National Sculpture Society,         The Hall of Fame for Great Americans holds special significance in the         history of this organization. In light of the large representation of         its past members' work, the NSS can rightly consider the sculpture displayed         in this monument to be among its noted contributions to American art.         (The NSS also played an integral civic role in the late 1970s when it         drew together a &quot;coalition&quot; of over thirty organizations in         an effort to rescue the monument from deterioration caused, in part, to         lack of federal funding.) </font></p>      <p><font class="second">A number of the sculptors had successful professional         careers before they made their contributions to The Hall of Fame and of         those whose work is original to the monument, Daniel Chester French is         by far the most celebrated. Other sculptors are lesser known today, but         notable in their own right. As has been the unfortunate fate of a few         of the monument's honorees, some of the sculptors are unknown or forgotten.         </font></p>      <table width="140" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="ekemel_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="kem2cont.jpg" width="140" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="ekemel_3.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               <i>James Abbott McNeill Whistler</i>, Frederick MacMonnies, 1931.               Bronze.

In the 1920s, when he was in his seventies,         French executed four busts for The Hall of Fame. Among them is <i>Edgar         Allan Poe</i> (elected 1910), whose physiognomy and tight, off-centered         scarf reflect the poet's difficult life and ominous subject matter. Frederick         MacMonnies, another important American sculptor, lived in France for years,         and even had his own &quot;school&quot; in Giverny to which American students         flocked for instruction from the revered &quot;master.&quot; Appropriately,         among one of three of his busts is the portrait of expatriate painter         <i>James Abbott McNeill Whistler</i> (elected 1930) modeled in MacMonnies         characteristically animated style. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Other sculptors who created original work to the         monument include, but are not limited to Herbert Adams, Robert Aitken,         Chester Beach, Alexander S. Calder, John Flanagan, James Earle Fraser,         Laura Gardin Fraser, Charles Grafly, Frances Grimes, Malvina Hoffman,         Anna Hyatt Huntington, Hermon A. MacNeil, Brenda Putnam, Lorado Taft and         Adolph Weinman. Each made their individual contribution to American sculpture.         Adams was critically acclaimed for his use of polychromy and the feminine,         ideal portraits of women he created. Recognized for her superb animal         sculpture, Huntington's <i>Joan of Arc</i> (1915) was the first known         heroic equestrian statue by a woman. MacNeil spent over a decade studying         and executing sculpture of American Indian people and themes. Author of         the first comprehensive survey of American nineteenth century sculptors         and their oeuvre (published 1903), Taft was an ardent critic of modern         art, although his own work was characterized by simple, abstract forms.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">From the group, one of the more masterfully executed         busts is Laura Gardin Fraser's portrait of <i>Mary Lyon</i> (elected 1905),         the early nineteenth century pioneer in women's higher education. The         flatness of the face and the minimal use of detail in the hair and dress         reveal the controlled craftsmanship of this sculptor. </font></p>      <table width="133" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="ekemel_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="kem3cont.jpg" width="133" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="ekemel_4.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               <i>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</i>, James Earle Fraser, 1926.

Certainly the most influential, prolific and dedicated         American sculptor of the late-nineteenth century, Saint-Gaudens is best         known for his standing Lincoln in Chicago Park and the equestrian statue         of General Sherman placed at the 59th Street entrance to Central Park         in New York City. James Earle Fraser, sculptor of the popular <i>End of         the Trail</i>, portrayed the eminent artist as a powerful and virile individual,         emphasized by the broadness and musculature of his naked torso. At the         same time, his brooding eyes and reflective countenance reveal a man of         creativity and contemplation. Saint-Gaudens' work is represented by the         replica busts of Abraham Lincoln (elected 1900) and <i>William Tecumseh         Sherman</i> (elected 1905). </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The Hall of Fame for Great Americans sadly continues         to suffer from insufficient funding in spite of many important reasons,         both aesthetic and historical, why it should receive the financial attention         it deserves to secure it for longevity. The monument is under the directorship         of Ralph Rourke, an Emmy-award winning producer and former Public Affairs         Officer at NYU, who honorably is committed to preserving its original         function as an educational and inspirational tool for students and visitors         alike. </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>What I didn't mention in the article:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">There was much that I learned about the history         and current state of the monument in writing this brief article that was         not appropriate or necessary to mention. (I also discovered more primary         material after writing the article.) It was also not important for me         to outline documents, sources and archives, which I wish to do here and         at the end of this paper. For one, I hope it will show the extent of information         that exists on this subject and how little has been done with it on the         scholarly level. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Perhaps, it would also be appropriate to ask why         hasn't anything scholarly been written on The Hall of Fame and why has         it virtually been disregarded by researchers interested in public art?         I should also qualify that when I say the work has been &quot;neglected,&quot;         a word I use in the title of this paper, I specifically refer to the degree         the monument has been ignored by academia - apparently no serious scholarship         on the work has been done. It seems to have not merited a dissertation         topic in any discipline, an article in a serious journal, including an         art history periodical, or the focus of a book. (I should note that my         bibliography is not exhaustive, so if my search has not come up with something         relevant, I certainly apologize for the omission and hope to learn what         it might be. Also because there was no abstract on file in the database         on Alice Louisa Dement, &quot;The higher education of Hall-of-Fame Americans,&quot;         Ph.D. diss., Stanford U, 1950, I could not determine at this time if her         subject relates to the Bronx monument.) </font></p>      <p><font class="second">A few magazine articles in the last decade have         featured the monument, but are hardly substantial in the scholarly sense.         The articles tend to be of a cultural or popular nature, give basic facts,         mention other halls of fame and reflect on the notion of fame and how         it is perceived today in comparison to the past. One of the more informed         articles is by Philip M. Katz, &quot;Valhalla in the Bronx,&quot; which         appeared in <i>CultureFront</i> magazine (Summer 1998), a publication         of the New York Council of Humanities. Katz weaves together the history         and current purposes of the monument with his own personal reflections         in a sympathetic manner toward his subject. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">There are certainly any number of approaches that         can be taken in writing about this monument. It could be considered from         the angle of its artistic merit, place in American art and architecture,         identity as an American Renaissance monument (I focus on this aspect below),         as a public monument, as a work on a college campus, as a patriotic and         national symbol, not to mention the notions of fame and hero-worship in         America, the issues of race, gender and multiculturalism (these issues         have been raised - see &quot;Sources and Documentation Notes&quot;), the         question of federal funding, and the Preservation Movement. These are         only a few of the &quot;topics&quot; from which The Hall of Fame could         be considered. From a strictly art historical angle, it would certainly         be of value to examine the European precedents and prototypes that influenced         the American conception of the country's first hall of fame. Along the         same lines, it would be of interest to compare this group of &quot;worthies&quot;         with earlier portrait art collections in America of distinguished subjects.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">My own interest in the immediate future may only         take me to further uncover the role the National Sculpture Society had         in the choice of sculptors chosen for the busts and the sculpture as a         group. It was not only that my audience would be sculptors that I chose         to focus on the sculptors, but that in doing a bibliographic search, I         found that the sculpture of the monument has virtually been ignored. Most         of the magazine articles that I have come across dating back to the installation         of the first busts either do not mention the sculptors of the busts, or         just cite their names. (The first bust to be installed was of Horace Mann,         unveiled May 1907 - the sculptor is identified as unknown and the work         was a replica; it was replaced by an original work by Adolph A. Weinman         in May 1930.) The focus in the print media has been, from the start, on         the subjects of the busts, the honorees, and this pattern continues to         the present. I'm not going to say that all the busts are of the highest         caliber, but certainly there a number of noteworthy examples of portraiture         in bronze, and as a group, they deserve both popular and scholarly attention.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">In addition, there is a whole history behind this         monument, documented in scores of newspaper articles and editorial notices         - the inauguration itself generated &quot;thousands&quot; - to be pulled         together and examined. Like many other American monuments from the late-nineteenth         century or turn-of-the century, the coverage on The Hall of Fame has run         the gamut from over-exposure to virtual neglect. This degree of popular         interest to disinterest in itself speaks to many issues and demonstrates         that the monument's history spans the changing tastes, movements, and         values of an entire century. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Through an examination of the articles a fuller         picture of the monument's selection of nominees, the electoral process,         the dedication ceremonies, the celebrations and installations could be         brought to light. A point of interest is the trumpeters at the inaugural         ceremonies where a group of women wearing togas and braided hair walked         triumphantly in the processional. The monument, with its Beaux-Arts style         architecture was certainly harking back symbolically to a time, particularly         classical times when life might have seemed purer and somewhat heroic.         It would be interesting to know what the public thought of the monument         and the level of patriotic feeling that was invoked by its dedication,         which took place on Memorial Day, May 30, 1901. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Needless to say, I've only touched on some of the         contexts in which The Hall of Fame for Great Americans could be approached.         Without a doubt there exists ample primary sources and other resources         for further research, investigation and discussion on this monument. (At         the end of the paper I briefly outline some of these sources.) </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>Why The Hall of Fame is an American Renaissance         monument: </b></font></p>      <p><font class="second"> The Hall of Fame for Great Americans was conceived         in the spirit of the American Renaissance and is truly an American Renaissance         monument. It therefore shares many of the main characteristics that define         any American Renaissance monument and the intentions, vision, and purposes         in its creation are closely aligned with other prominent public projects         and artistic works of this period. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The American Renaissance was a period, a movement,         and a way of thinking that prevailed over the art and architecture of         America and the social and intellectual life of Americans between the         third-quarter of the nineteenth century to the first-quarter of the twentieth         century. The exact time-frame of this period is something of a debate.         (My discussion of this period relies, in part, on the important work,         <i>American Renaissance 1876-1917</i> published 1979 in conjunction with         the exhibition of the same title given by the Brooklyn Museum.) </font></p>      <p><font class="second">I will briefly discuss below some of the major characteristics         that identify an American Renaissance monument, project, plan, building,         or other work of art or architecture in relation to The Hall of Fame.         I will also point out some of the main factors - &quot;the genteel tradition&quot;,         nationalism and civic pride - that propelled the movement and the creation         of The Hall of Fame. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">An unofficial group - referred to under the description         of the &quot;genteel tradition - of intellectuals, writers, educators,         artists, along with businessmen, sought to educate, morally uplift and         civilize the American people through art, education and civic beautification.         Among this group can be included Henry Mitchell MacCracken, who started         out as a philosophy professor in 1884 at New York University (then the         University of the City of New York) and progressed to the position of         Chancellor in 1891, a post he held till 1910. As an educator and The Hall         of Fame's originator, he sought to embrace America's past by distinguishing         both its leaders and its private citizens. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">MacCracken was joined in his mission by like-minded         men, those that undoubtedly shared the values of the &quot;genteel tradition.&quot;         For the first election in 1900, names were submitted by the general public         through solicitation in newspapers. From this list the New York University         Senate members narrowed down the candidates. The final selection was in         the hands of a group of about 100 people nationwide - the electors - who         were distinguished by such divisions as &quot;University and College Presidents,&quot;         &quot;Professors,&quot; &quot;Men of Affairs&quot; and &quot;High Public         Officials.&quot; It would certainly be interesting to look more closely         at these group of men, their mutual associations and how they were chosen.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">As the first hall of fame in America and called         the &quot;National Pantheon&quot; by journalists, the work was certainly         conceived as a public monument that would arouse national, as well as         civic sentiments. One of the criteria for candidacy in the original Constitution         (later overruled) was that only native-born Americans could be elected.         Nationalism was another major driving force in the production of American         Renaissance public monuments and civic projects. What place did America         have in the civilization of the world? What was its present position and         how could it be maintained? If America was a great nation, should not         its cities, its art and people reflect that greatness? These were some         of the questions that propelled the re-evaluation of the nation as a whole,         as well as its urban areas and their populace. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The vision that MacCracken saw for The Hall of Fame         was a monument that would honor not only political leaders, such as George         Washington (the only honoree voted in unanimously), but Americans who         distinguished themselves in every field (one of the categories allowed         for &quot;miscellaneous&quot; candidates). It was believed that visitors         from all over the nation would look to those chosen men (and some women)         and be inspired to higher values, particularly patriotism, nationalism         and civic-pride. This honor role would serve as models of citizenry and         greatness. (The notion of &quot;greatness&quot; was itself being redefined.)         In addition, the Constitution from the start (but with much public opposition)         allowed for the election of Southern figures (Robert E. Lee was elected         in 1900 by 68 votes), which underscored the intent for the monument to         somehow unify the nation. MacCracken wrote in the 1901 book he authored         on the monument: </font></p>      <blockquote><font class="second">It [the group of electors] will know no         South or North; no West or East. Its calm, clear judgment will overrule         sectional and partisan outcry. (84)</font></blockquote>      <p><font class="second">Its importance to the city as a landmark was not         lost on MacCracken, nor on the many editorial and newspaper writers who         expressed civic pride in The Hall of Fame's location in New York City.         The American Renaissance period can rightly be credited with continuing         the goals of the City Beautiful Movement (which started in the mid-1850's)         in the creation and decoration of America's metropolitan areas. New Yorkers         in this time witnessed major aesthetic changes to their city. Major monuments         with elaborate decoration and buildings with architectural ornamentation         and allegorical figures were being erected before their eyes. College         campuses, particularly that of Columbia University and New York University's         uptown campus (on which The Hall of Fame stands) with their complex of         Beaux-Arts style buildings were almost small cities in themselves. Monuments         such as The Hall of Fame, visited by thousands each year, no doubt evoked         a sense of pride in New York City, the intention of its creator and others         with similar hopes. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Stylistically and in terms of landscape design,         The Hall of Fame and its adjacent buildings are primary examples of American         Renaissance architecture. While the style of the American Renaissance         was eclectic most of the art referenced was mainly (but not exclusively)         European. In the case of architecture the source was particularly French         Beaux-Arts or more generally classicism. Intellectual, historic and artistic         associations were made to the Italian Renaissance, which served as the         &quot;ideal&quot; period of civilization and the predecessor to America's         own greatness as a nation. The colonnade terrace of The Hall of Fame was         created in a Beaux-Arts style as part of an ensemble of other buildings         conceived within a total planned environment that took into consideration         its surrounding landscape. Early photographs show, for example, that in         the back of the monument, paths lead to its first level interior (to be         discussed below) and the superb fountain in the back of the monument.         Each part of the ensemble, the three buildings and the colonnade, work         harmoniously in style, movement, and purpose. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The works and projects generated during the American         Renaissance are particularly distinguished not only by style but also         by how they were executed and the materials used. During this period a         large-scale work or project was, in many cases, collaborative, meaning         it was intended to be or was actually executed by many individuals - architects,         painters, sculptors, craftsmen, artisans. This was certainly the case         in the quintessential American Renaissance project, the World's Columbian         Exposition (1893), which provoked Augustus Saint-Gaudens to remark, &quot;This         is the greatest meeting of artists since the fifteenth century.&quot;         Corresponding with the variety of creative artists involved was the use         of different mediums to create a &quot;total work of art.&quot; For example,         an American Renaissance mansion would have brought together architecture,         painting, sculpture, mural painting, landscape gardening, stained glass,         mosaics, ceramics, and other decorative arts. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">While The Hall of Fame realized the vision of bringing         together two of the main arts, sculpture and architecture, it fell short         of actually incorporating painting, particularly, mural painting, which         was a prominent feature in a number of public and private buildings during         this period. The idea of including mural painting in the area named the         &quot;Museum of The Hall of Fame&quot; was seriously discussed, though         never realized. (Ralph Rourke, the current Director stated that, to his         knowledge, the proposed mural project &quot;never came to fruition.&quot;)         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The first level or substructure (under the colonnade)         was officially to be used as a museum as explained by MacCracken in his         1901 book: </font></p>      <blockquote><font class="second">The granite edifice which will serve as         the foundation of The Hall of Fame shall be named the Museum of The Hall         of Fame. Its final exclusive use shall be the commemoration of the great         Americans whose names are inscribed in the colonnade above, by the preservation         and exhibition of portraits and other important mementos of these citizens.         The six rooms and the long corridor shall in succession be set apart to         this exclusive use. The room to be first used shall be named the Washington         Gallery, and shall be set apart so soon as ten or more portraits of the         persons inscribed shall be accepted for permanent preservation by the         University. . . . Statues and busts of the great Americans chosen may         be assigned places either in the Museum of The Hall of Fame or in the         Hall itself. (9-10) </font></blockquote>      <p><font class="second">The Museum walls would have been decorated with         murals as the following paper given by the Society of Mural Painters reveals:         </font></p>      <blockquote><font class="second">The Committee on Civic Buildings of the         National Society of Mural Painters, having carefully considered the possibilities         of the embellishment of the Museum of The Hall of Fame by appropriate         mural painting, hereby makes the following suggestions: That it is eminently         fitting that, in a commemoration of national greatness such as The Hall         of Fame, the three great arts, Architecture, Sculpture, and Mural Painting,         should collaborate, not only to perpetuate the memory of the great men         of the nation for all time, but also to serve as an example of monumental         art in America of today. . . . We would suggest that . . . the central         gallery, which has the largest uninterrupted frieze-line, be taken up         first, and a painting be placed here, chiefly allegorical, typifying <i>American         progress, the ideals of the nation, and its place in the history of civilization</i>.         (Reprinted in MacCracken, 1901, 71) </font></blockquote>      <p><font class="second">The Museum was to house painting, sculpture, as         well as artifacts and archives that would grow into a collection of <i>Americana</i>,         an example of how the monument would claim America's history and advance         American culture. The subject of the proposed mural for the central gallery         would have certainly expressed the major principles that galvanized the         American Renaissance movement. (Also, according Rourke, the Museum housed         a famous clock collection that was given over to the Smithsonian and the         largest room was once used as a reserve reading room.) </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Finally, The Hall of Fame was not publicly funded,         nor was it paid for by the university, but rather it was financially sponsored         by Helen Miller Gould, daughter of Jay Gould, who made his fortune in         the railroad industry. The American Renaissance was a period when wealthy         Americans, such as the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers were trying to         establish themselves as the stately and noble families of America. Their         private homes, whether Fifth Avenue mansions or summer retreats were conceived         and decorated by scores of artists working together to create harmonious         outdoor and indoor living spaces. For the public good and perhaps to elevate         their own social standing, they spent extensively in the fields of art         and education, financing public works and projects, such as major museums,         libraries and monuments as The Hall of Fame for Great Americans. </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>The current state of affairs:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">The monument has not been entirely ignored in the         last few years, particularly this past year since the centennial ceremonies         have generated publicity (the Centennial Gala took place on June 12, 2000).         Once called the &quot;Hall of Shame,&quot; editorial, magazine and newspaper         articles are being written with a much more sympathetic and even patriotic         tone toward the monument and its plight for increased funding. Since restoration         and preservation was done in the1980s and early 1990s, the condition of         the busts and the colonnade is good, though continuous maintenance is         needed. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Ralph Rourke, the Director of The Hall of Fame,         is familiar with both the history of New York University and educational         projects. He served as a Public Affairs Officer at NYU for years and is         also an Emmy-Award winning producer for &quot;Sunrise Semester,&quot;         which was a nationally syndicated educational program that ran for twenty-five         years. In 1987 he was hired by Bronx Community College as a media consultant,         and two years later, in the fall of 1989, he took on the role of Director         of the monument. Over the course of six years he raised at least $600,000         in state grant funds, when such funds were available. Under Governor Pataki         state grants have been frozen. The monument only received $10,000 last         year in state money, what Rourke has called a &quot;token grant.&quot;         Rourke conveyed that the American Heritage Trust, a division of The Department         of Parks, The State Dormitory Authority, as well as the New York State         Democratic Delegation to the Assembly, have all contributed in some way         to preserving the monument. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">What Rourke seems to be aiming toward is finding         a way to have continuous, uninterrupted funding so that the monument can         receive regular upkeep and function as a viable institution for the community         and the nation as a whole. His goal is to bring The Hall of Fame &quot;into         the twenty-first century,&quot; while maintaining and fostering the original         aims of education and inspiration. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">This summer <i>The Daily News</i> (June 11, 2000)         did a piece focusing on the four nominees (Louis D. Brandeis, Clara Barton,         Luther Burbank, Andrew Carnegie) who have yet to have their busts commissioned         and installed and the organizations that have failed them. Rourke related         that the four busts not yet executed were originally supposed to be underwritten         by individual organizations that made pledges. At this point these groups         have not fulfilled their original promises. If they or other organizations         don't come through, the tradition of underwriting the busts will have         to be broken, Rourke said. Each bust is currently estimated to at least         $25,000 a piece. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">There seems to be good news on the horizon for The         Hall of Fame. As an outcome of <i>The Daily News</i> story, Fernando Ferrer,         the Bronx Borough President announced at the Centennial Gala that he is         offering a half-million dollar matching grant &quot;from the next capital         budget.&quot; If the other half can be raised, the total sum of one million         dollars would be an incredible boost for the monument, which is visited         by approximately 25,000 people each year. </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>Concluding notes:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">In these notes I hope I've conveyed my enthusiasm         for this monument, that I actually like it and care about its longevity.         If this sounds odd, it's the only way, aside from contributing these notes,         to express my own feelings toward what may otherwise be a very neglected         piece of American history.

Also a complete list of the medalists, who were not necessarily         the sculptors of the busts, can be obtained from Ralph Rourke. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The National Sculpture Society also has clippings         on The Hall of Fame and their &quot;Minutes&quot; from the late 1970's         documents the organizations role to save the monument from deterioration.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Precedents and prototypes: <br>        To what extent The Hall of Fame was MacCracken's personal vision is something         that needs further exploration. What is certain though is that the actual         structure, the semi-circular colonnade was not his conception, but Stanford         White's. MacCracken repeated in several sources how the idea of The Hall         of Fame came about. In a published interview given around the time of         his retirement in 1910, MacCracken was quoted as saying that initially         &quot;There was no educational reason for it [the semi-circular structure],&quot;         which compelled him to think of one in order to justify the cost of its         construction. MacCracken who had studied and lived in Germany for a brief         period in the late 1860's noted that he &quot;remembered the two Halls         of Fame at Regensberg and Munich,&quot; and that the structure conceived         by the architect &quot;might be used as an American Hall of Fame.&quot;         (&quot;So Says Chancellor MacCracken on the Eve of Retiring,&quot; <i>New-York         Daily Tribune</i>, Mar. [1910?] - for this article see scrapbook at University         Archives.) It should be stressed that the original guidelines (in the         Constitution) only specified for the possibility of including busts or         statues in the Hall or Museum. The main intent was to fulfill the installation         of memorial bronze tablets along the colonnade. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">For Parisian precedents, particularly the Panthon,         see June Hargrove <i>The Statues of Paris : an Open Air Pantheon</i> (New         York: Vendome Press, 1990). </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Beside the German and French references, comparisons         in articles were also made to Westminster Abbey. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">For early American precedents see Brandon Brame         Fortune, &quot;Portraits of virtue and Genius: Pantheons of Worthies and         Public Portraiture in the Early American Republic, 1780-1920,&quot; Ph.D.         diss., U of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1986.
