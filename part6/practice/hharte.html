It             engages the functions of commemoration, awareness, and enlightenment             that monuments are expected to perform, but also adopts less conventional             purposes and meanings, particularly the experience of abstract form             and philosophical speculation, that might be considered the realm             of high modernism but not public memorials. Completely non-representational             and essentially Minimalist in spirit, Crawford's column could become             a test case of the viability of abstraction as meaningful public art             in the aftermath of controversies surrounding public art projects             that have included, among others, Richard Serra's <i>Tilted Arc</i>.             It also continues a tradition of symbolic, expressive meaning in Minimalism             long after the movement ceased to dominate what was considered radical             in the visual arts, as seen in such well-known works as Maya Lin's             <i>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</i>.</font>             <p> <font class="second"><i>Queens College Marker</i> is a column               formed by three vertically stacked blocks of solid carbon steel               that are unpainted, unpolished, and in the process of rusting. At               26.5 feet in height, the column is nearly three stories tall. Each               block is nearly equal in length to the others, and all are vaguely               oval in their cross-sections. The column never exceeds three feet               in width. It is placed in the center of a slightly convex, circular               mound of grass twenty feet in diameter. This area of grass is located               in a concrete walkway which constitutes a small plaza sandwiched               between two large buildings on the campus, Rosenthal Library (to               the west) and Powdermaker Hall (to the east). This plaza is located               in the middle of a north-south axis of pedestrian traffic established               by entrances on opposite ends of the campus. Several feet to the               west of the sculpture but still located on the circle of grass are               five boulders, each one approximately two feet high and three to               four feet in width.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Crawford has said that &quot;there is a lot               of sculptural poetry in how things are joined together. This installation               is not about tightening a few bolts.&quot; <small><sup>1</sup></small>               The bottom segment of the sculpture, forged without benefit of machinery               which would create streamlined planes and contours, is a broad,               squat form, whose surface curves continually with no hard edges.               This piece, the least rusted of the three, is a dark gray, with               scratch-like patches of glowing orange rust scattered across its               surface. The transitions from segment to segment are accomplished               by abutting or interpenetrating the columns at different places               along their bottom or top edges. Where two segments abut and one               hangs over the other slightly, the steel has been rough- or hand-forged               (it has not been shaped with machines); where two segments smoothly               interlock, the steel has been smooth-or machine-forged (it has been               shaped by machine).<small><sup>2</sup></small> The middle segment               has been forged in both ways. Three planar areas have been cut down               its eastern side. This gives this segment a leaner, more streamlined               quality, a sensation of rapid motion that helps to draw your eye               farther upward. The western side of this segment is continuously               curved and is oxidized to a rich orange hue. The top segment is               entirely smooth-forged, making it the sleekest, most geometric,               most mechanical part of the sculpture. Its entire surface is oxidized               to a rich orange, making it seem the brightest in hue. Five planar               surfaces have been cut down its sides.</font>            <p> <font class="second">By being placed slightly off-center in a               major walkway on the campus, this steel tower can be seen so intimately               that the viewer can walk up and touch it, or it can be seen as remotely               as two hundred feet away. It can also be seen in fragments from               many windows in the two buildings which flank it. Although the fragmentary               window views do intrigue, they are not very satisfying because the               full impact of the work depends on viewing it in its entirety. From               any distance the sculpture adamantly yet gracefully makes its existence               known. The solemn, poignant presence of the sculpture cannot be               ignored as it towers in the otherwise bland but functional plaza.</font>            </p>             <table width="197" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="hharte_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="har2cont.jpg" width="197" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"> <a href="hharte_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>Queens                     College Marker</i> in Situ.

When viewed from this distance,               one can achieve the most engaging sculptural experience the work               permits. The shifting orientation of the three segments, their variety               of planar surfaces, colors, and textures, and the transition from               a rough-forged surface at the bottom to a smooth-forged one at the               top are visually exciting and absorbing, offering a wide range of               beautiful abstract sculptural experiences. The possibilities are               expanded by walking slowly around the sculpture as you look at it               continuously or repeatedly. In doing this the work takes on new               life, for changes in perspective provide changes in shape, size,               and the arrangement of forms. The marker seems to soar to the sky,               even though it is also firmly rooted in the soil. It seems to twist               in different directions from segment to segment, yet it is motionless.               Its steel surfaces can be dismally gray or brightly orange, as changes               in light alter changes in mood. At a distance of a few hundred feet               the sculpture is sometimes distilled to a dark silhouette. This               effect is especially noticeable at twilight or at night.</font>             <p> <font class="second">Crawford was born in 1953 in New York City               to an artistically-inclined family. His father was the Precisionist               painter Rawlston Crawford and his mother and two brothers are photographers.<small><sup>3</sup></small>               Ironically, Crawford gravitated toward sculpture, but a difference               in media does not assume a difference in sensibility. Crawford would               agree, for he credits his father with instilling in him a fascination               with visual structure and the belief that structure is essential               to meaning.<small><sup>4</sup></small> Crawford earned a B.F.A.               in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1976 and               then worked as an apprentice to blacksmiths in Italy for ten years.               As an apprentice blacksmith, Crawford learned pre-industrial, manual               techniques of working with metals in a sixteenth century, water-powered               forge, where he made farming tools.<small><sup>5</sup></small></font>             <p>            <font class="second">Before apprenticing as a blacksmith, Crawford             built abstract figures out of wood logs.<small><sup>6</sup></small>             Crawford said that he chose to learn blacksmithing because he has             long been interested in tools.<small><sup>7</sup></small> In Italy,             Crawford began to work in iron (in return for his services to the             blacksmiths he was able to use the forge to make his own sculptures),             and his work of this period includes pieces which reflect the look             and function of farm tools and others which are more architectural             in style. The architectural objects include arched forms, forms held             together by tension or compression, and forms held together with iron             pins serving as joints. They typically include bold arrangements of             a few block- or rod-like pieces of iron reaching in various directions.             Much of Crawford's work reveals his keen interest in the physical             characteristics of materials, and in the architectural, mechanical,             and industrial. Crawford's interest in structure extends beyond the             man-made to that found in nature, such as the structure of minerals,             including the geometric structure of iron pyrite crystals, which can             be described as fractals. These structures are evident in the spatial             arrangements of some of Crawford's sculptures. These visual explorations             of structure are for Crawford an attempt to find order and harmony             in life. Important examples of Crawford's work in iron prior to the             Markers include <i>3 Legged Arch #7</i> (1984) and <i>Braced Form             #16</i> (1984-86).</font>            <p> <font class="second"><i>Queens College Marker</i> was commissioned               by Queens College for its Benjamin Rosenthal Library, which opened               in 1988, in fulfillment of the Percent for Art Program of New York               City. The committee established to obtain art for the Rosenthal               Library, headed by chief art librarian Suzanna Simor, considered               11,000 artists and solicited 150 proposals before choosing the proposal               submitted by Crawford.<small><sup>8</sup></small> The cost of the               project was $100,000.<small><sup>9</sup></small> The sculpture was               constructed at Scot Forge in Spring Grove, Illinois, where it was               initially forged, and then at the Rose Corporation in Reading, Pennsylvania,               where the process of forging was completed.<small><sup>10</sup></small>               <i>Queens College Marker</i> is less commonly known as <i>Marker               I-4</i>, which for the sculptor means the fourth marker he has made               in iron.<small><sup>11</sup></small> Although the sculpture was               installed as its basic design was described by Crawford in his original               proposal, as &quot;a tower of forged, machined billets of steel&quot;               with &quot;three interlocking pieces,&quot; it underwent considerable               change before installation. Crawford originally planned for it to               be placed on the opposite side of the library, in a ravine one-story               deep on the northwest corner of the building which flanks the windows               of the reading room in the first floor.<small><sup>12</sup></small>               At one time he also intended the sculpture to consist of four segments.               Crawford wanted one connection point visible to the viewers in the               reading room of each floor (they are directly overhead from floor               to floor) as the sculpture rose alongside the building to the fourth               floor.<small><sup>13</sup></small> Crawford thinks this plan had               intriguing possibilities, but has no regrets that the committee               eventually decided to relocate the sculpture, a decision which led               him to drop the four-segment design in favor of the three-segment               plan.<small><sup>14</sup></small> Both decisions proved to be wise               ones. The original location for this work is secluded; no matter               how effective it may have been there, it would have been experienced               by far fewer people. If the sculpture consisted of four segments               and therefore would have been appropriately longer, it might have               become disconcertingly tall.</font>             <p><font class="second"><i>Queens College Marker</i> is part of a               series of sculptures Crawford calls Markers, which he began making               in the late 1980s. Crawford has made several markers in iron, tin,               and wood. Some are as small as scale models while many range in               size from four to seven feet tall. These works frequently consist               of a few block- or slab-like forms that are sometimes juxtaposed               with or held aloft by a few rod-like forms. The works feature both               human and architectural proportions and offer a rich array of abstract               sculptural experiences due to the forthright and intimate arrangements               of their blunt, faintly geometric forms. Crawford's first monumental,               site-specific markers were the sculptures he designed for Amherst               College in 1990. These works are called Markers because they refer               to the desire of all people to produce enduring evidence of their               existence for those who follow them; as Crawford says &quot;the               desire to leave your mark is very strong.&quot;<small><sup>15</sup></small>               The sculptures have been more profoundly and obviously influenced               by prehistoric, northern European stone monuments such as Stonehenge,               the Dolmens, and the Stone Circles of Carnac. Crawford says &quot;the               megaliths are for me a poetic tool for understanding the world and               man's self-appointed centrality in that order, and the fractal structures               are a less egocentric form for that same understanding. We are each               the center of a universe and at the same time peripheral participants               in immense patterns.&quot;<small><sup>16</sup></small> He says he               &quot;wants you to see these expressions as humanity trying to place               itself, trying to derive meaning from all this.&quot;<small><sup>17</sup></small></font>             <p> <font class="second">Crawford wants <i>Queens College Marker</i>               to be appreciated for the sculptural experience it provides as well               as for the spiritual, philosophical meanings it contains, meanings               which originated in his oeuvre in the earlier Markers. He has described               the sculpture at Queens College as &quot;a visual poem&quot; that               &quot;holds the space&quot; of the plaza.<small><sup>18</sup></small>               However, in his proposal for the project, the sculptor clearly intended               a more symbolic meaning as well. He writes that the three segments               and their transition from rough-forged to smooth-forged &quot;are               a metaphor for a journey, be it life, education, enlightenment.               The tower is also a marker, a cairn on a mountain path, a symbol               of a man's accomplishments--his attempts to define himself and place               himself and leave evidence thereof for those who follow.&quot; <small><sup>19</sup></small>               The shift from rough-hewn to smooth-contoured clearly symbolizes               transformation and transition. It is possible to think of this as               a shift toward more advanced technology and increased industrialization,               and thus the work can become a metaphor for a broad theme in world               history. Located on a college campus, between the library and the               building that houses most of the social sciences departments, this               symbolism acquires certain other connotations. A shift toward greater               refinement alludes to learning, to sharpening or &quot;refining&quot;               one's mind, to acquiring greater knowledge and understanding. Crawford               would not deny these meanings, but he would discourage the viewer               from ever dwelling on them because he thinks that to emphasize any               singular, literal meaning diminishes the aesthetic experience of               the sculpture. The great virtue of <i>Queens College Marker</i>               is that various meanings, aesthetic as well as thematic, are completely               unified and delicately balanced in powerful abstract form. </font>             <p> <font class="second">A mammoth form of rusting steel as public               art would automatically bring to mind Richard Serra's <i>Tilted               Arc</i>. Crawford acknowledges that he and Serra use similar materials,               but insists that he is dealing with a different set of ideas. How               will Crawford's work be received and understood, in the aftermath               of this infamous controversy of public art? To date no objections               have apparently been voiced, and with good reason, for Crawford's               work offers a strong argument for a pleasurable, engaging aesthetic               experience made possible by rusting metal. Unlike <i>Tilted Arc</i>,               this sculpture has been placed in an area of this walkway that would               not receive pedestrian traffic and because of its narrow width it               does not obstruct the view of surrounding buildings. It is placed               to the side of the pedestrian pathway; it cannot be ignored yet               it does not impede activity and movement.</font>            <p> <font class="second">The sculptor has said that &quot;hopefully               people will see something in this [<i>Queens College Marker</i>]               that gives them a sense of beauty and order.&quot; <small><sup>20</sup></small>               Such meanings are also fundamental to the prehistoric monuments               so important to Crawford's thinking. <i>Stonehenge</i>, for instance,               may have been a clock, and thus it was a tool--keeping in mind tools               are also of interest to Crawford--for understanding time. Crawford's               <i>Markers</i> are meditative forms, and the <i>Queens College Marker</i>               is especially so. Moreover, it is solemn, poignant, and even somewhat               melancholy. This quality originates in the deliberately rusting               surface, which metaphorically alludes to the passage of time and               the fading of all things into nothingness that is a function of               time. Since the <i>Markers</i> are deliberate attempts to make known               the existence of the generic someone or something at any one time               or place, then the <i>Marker</i> at Queens College fully embraces               the function of commemoration that all monuments since the dawn               of civilization have been expected to perform. However, the metaphoric               implications of the rusting surface indicate that monuments and               markers are caught in a battle they can never win; they try to preserve               that which is unpreservable and to make eternal that which is transitory.               According to Crawford, the rusting alludes to humanity's &quot;way               of falling apart.&quot; <small><sup>21</sup></small> Thus a tone               of melancholy persists, and such melancholy is foreign to public               monuments, since it self-destroys the purpose for which the monuments               were originally created. However, the work is not entirely pessimistic               in meaning, for through its very presence in the plaza, <i>Queens               College Marker</i> fights to preserve the possibility of commemoration,               to reject the disappearance of all things in time. Crawford has               said that &quot;hopefully, this will be a focal point, a marker               that will help recall monuments.&quot;<small><sup>22</sup></small>               The sculpture reminds us that ultimately all monuments are markers               in purpose and spirit. Since it purifies and embodies the concept               of commemoration that is fundamental to monuments as a human endeavor               of prehistoric origin, <i>Queens College Marker</i> is a monument's               monument, for it monumentalizes the commemorative and it commemorates               the monumental.</font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="hharte_ref.html">References&gt;&gt;</a></font>            <P><font class="second"><a href="hharte_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font> </P>            </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;         2000 Part and Herbert R.
