Instead it is in the form of &quot;notes&quot;               and thoughts brought together from information gathered over the               course of the last two months. Since it was not my intention to               write a paper that would have a clear-cut thesis or present a fully-researched               topic, I decided to experiment with this format. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">I begin by relaying how I came across and               learned of the monument, The Hall of Fame for Great Americans at               Bronx Community College. This is followed by background information               on the history and sculptors of The Hall of Fame. I choose to reprint               an article that I wrote this summer, rather than weave it in with               more specific ideas and issues. I continue by discussing what I               didn't mention in the article, mainly focusing on the lack of scholarship               on the subject. Further, I examine the characteristics that identify               The Hall of Fame as an American Renaissance monument and I conclude               with a brief update on its current condition and financial state</font></p>            <p><font class="second">In presenting my research as I have in this               paper, I hope to fulfill my secondary aim to broaden the possibilities               of disseminating information by challenging the traditional forms               of style and methodology in scholarship. I feel that online writing               may be more flexible, if the venue allows, in this case an online               art history journal aimed for an audience of graduate students.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">My hope is that these notes might stimulate               further discussion and research of the subject and generate online               feedback that might be helpful for interested scholars or other               writers. </font></p>            <p>            <font class="second">At the end I provide sources and documentation             notes, a smmary of related online sites, and a list of sculptors and             their portrait busts.             <p>I have included within the text photographs that I took on the               premises. May I suggest that you look at the following site <a href="http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/hallofFame" target="_blank">               http://www.bcc.cuny.edu/hallofFame</a> which offers both a &quot;Photo               Gallery&quot; and a &quot;Virtual Reality Scene&quot; with a zoom               in and out feature. Also, there are a few worthwhile photos at <a href="http://www.forgottenny.com/STREETSCENES/HallOfFame/hallfame.htm" target="_blank">               http://www.forgottenny.com/STREETSCENES/HallOf20Fame/hallfame.htm</a>.             </p>            <p><b>How I came across the subject:</b></p>            <p>In the beginning of the summer, I was given a folder of information,               mostly secondary sources, on The Hall of Fame for Great Americans               and asked by the editor to write an article of a few pages for the               <i>National Sculpture Society News Bulletin</i>, the newsletter               of the National Sculpture Society. </p>            <p>The subject was not wholly new to me, that is I had actually visited               this monument a few years back. I also recalled that I did at some               point in graduate school want to research the topic. The truth is               I couldn't remember at that moment if the work was located at Lehman               College or Bronx Community College. But I knew it was in the Bronx               and on a City University of New York college campus. </p>            <p>It was later in the day that I went through the events in my mind               on how I came across this monument. I was applying to the graduate               art history program at The Graduate Center of The City University               of New York (CUNY) and for some reason, I think a friend suggested               it, I should include a dissertation topic that I might pursue if               accepted. Having an interest in public sculpture, but not being               too clear on what a dissertation entails, I came up with the enormous               proposal of art on CUNY campuses. I got my camera, my notes and               tokens (before Metrocard days) and headed, over the course of a               few days, from one CUNY campus to another. I think I started out               in Kingsborough Community College, which is the closest CUNY to               me and ventured as far as Bronx Community College. There, at BCC,               coming across by mere chance, I discovered, or at least I thought               I discovered, a lost treasure. That was how I came to know of The               Hall of Fame for Great Americans. </p>            <p>Yet, even after having visited The Hall of Fame a few years back               and having heard in a graduate school course that it still exists               quietly in the Bronx, I remained in a quandary of what it was and               how it came to be. </p>            <p><b>What is The Hall of Fame for Great Americans: </b></p>            <p>In considering this question and how to bring together factual               information with other issues and concerns, I decided to reprint               here, with a few changes and omissions, the article that I wrote               for the <i>National Sculpture Society News Bulletin</i> (published               August -September 2000). This article was written for an audience               of National Sculpture Society members, particularly its sculptor               members. My interest in the National Sculpture Society - the first               professional organization for sculptors in America (founded 1893)               - stems back a few years, having done an internship there. I am               also currently writing and researching my dissertation, &quot;The               Professionalization of Sculptors in America: the Origins of the               National Sculpture Society.&quot; Having established some background               information here, I follow by discussing what wasn't included in               the article. </p>            </font>            <table width="200" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="ekemel_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="kem4cont.jpg" width="200" height="132" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="ekemel_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">Semi-circular                     colonnade, Hall of Fame for Great Americans, Bronx Community                     College. <br>                    Photo by Elena Kemelman. </font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <font class="second">             <p>The Hall of Fame for Great Americans approaching the one-hundredth               anniversary of its official dedication date of May 30, 1901 (built               1900-1901) is a formidable work of art and architecture, and is               America's first hall of fame. It honors American men and women of               distinction in the fields of science, art, literature, religion,               education, business, government and social and economic reform.               Chosen in elections held over the course of seventy-six years (1900-1976),               nearly one-hundred Americans are represented by individual life-like               portrait busts installed within an open-air colonnaded terrace known               as The Hall of Fame for Great Americans. </p>            <p>The 630 feet long semi-circular colonnade, along with its three               adjacent Beaux-Arts style buildings (The Gould Memorial Library,               the Halls of Philosophy and Languages) was designed by Stanford               White, architect of the Washington Memorial Arch in New York's Washington               Square Park, among many other important public and private works.               The terrace with its curving form was designed by the architect               to set off the rigidity of its landscape. The idea of turning the               structure into a hall of fame that would serve an educational purpose               was conceived by Henry M. MacCracken, Chancellor of New York University               (1891-1910). </p>            <p>Once the uptown campus of New York University, the grounds on which               The Hall of Fame is located was ceded to Bronx Community College               in 1973; the campus is located at University Avenue and West 181st               Street. </p>            <p>The terrace and its cluster of buildings stand &quot;on the highest               natural point in New York City&quot; overlooking the New Jersey               Palisades and the Harlem and Hudson Rivers. The site holds a special               place in the history of the American Revolution, when it was used               as a British fort. </p>            <p>Following years of disregard and bad publicity, it has received               positive print, television, and magazine coverage over the last               decade. Yet in spite of the renewed popular interest in this &quot;National               Pantheon&quot; - which has been listed on the National Register               of Historic Places since February 1966 - the nearly six dozen sculptors               and the bronze busts they created have received little attention.             </p>            <p>All together 102 niches contain 98 busts executed by a total of               55 sculptors. Four niches remain empty, with the busts of the four               honorees yet to be installed since their 1970s elections. Thanks               to restoration work done in the 1980s and early 1990s, both the               busts and the terrace are in good condition. Underneath each bust               is a long horizontal bronze tablet, inscribed with the honoree's               name, dates of birth and death and a quote or in the case of two               composers, the clever choice of musical scores instead of words.             </p>            <p>Since sculptors were asked to contribute a work made expressly               for The Hall of Fame, all but nine busts, which are replicas, are               original to the monument. The dates of execution of original busts               range from the early 1920s to the late 1970s. In light of the fact               that candidates for election were only eligible to be nominated               after their deaths (a designated number of years), the sculptors               would have presumably had to turn to pictorial or plastic sources               for inspiration. In spite of this disadvantage, and a credit to               them, the sculptors overall endowed their subjects with dignity               and humility, a sense of naturalism and personality. </p>            <p>An added attraction is the replica bust of Jean-Antoine Houdon's               <i>Marquis de Lafayette</i>, separately chosen in way of honoring               his role in the American Revolution. The bust is located in an exterior               wall niche of the centrally connected building, the domed Gould               Memorial Library, originally named in memory of Jay Gould, the railroad               tycoon and father of The Hall of Fame's first financial donor, Helen               Miller Gould Shepard. Houdon's work is also represented in his replicas               of <i>George Washington</i> (the only subject to receive unanimous               votes, elected 1900) and Robert Fulton (elected 1900), both part               of the colonnade group of 98 portraits. </p>            <p>There are fourteen works, including both male and female subjects,               by eleven women sculptors. Women candidates were eligible from the               first election in 1900, thought it was not until the second election,               five years later, with the inclusion of three female inductees,               that women were represented on the list of great Americans. By 1922,               a total of eight women were selected, and the original 1914 plan               to separate women honorees in their own &quot;Hall of Fame for Women&quot;               within the colonnade was abandoned. </p>            <p>As a group, the 98 busts form an important and impressive collection               of American portrait sculpture in bronze and have been noted to               be &quot;the largest and finest collection of bronze busts anywhere               in our country.&quot; Of the 55 sculptors, all are considered American               sculptors or are distinguished for their contribution to American               sculpture. The latter applies to the Italian Giuseppe Ceracchi,               who visited the U.S. in the 1790s, and France's finest eighteenth               century sculptor, Jean Antoine Houdon, who modeled George Washington               from life in his Mount Vernon estate. </p>            <p>Notably, since almost three-quarters of the 55 sculptors can be               identified as having been members of the National Sculpture Society,               The Hall of Fame for Great Americans holds special significance               in the history of this organization. In light of the large representation               of its past members' work, the NSS can rightly consider the sculpture               displayed in this monument to be among its noted contributions to               American art. (The NSS also played an integral civic role in the               late 1970s when it drew together a &quot;coalition&quot; of over               thirty organizations in an effort to rescue the monument from deterioration               caused, in part, to lack of federal funding.) </p>            <p>A number of the sculptors had successful professional careers before               they made their contributions to The Hall of Fame and of those whose               work is original to the monument, Daniel Chester French is by far               the most celebrated. Other sculptors are lesser known today, but               notable in their own right. As has been the unfortunate fate of               a few of the monument's honorees, some of the sculptors are unknown               or forgotten. </p>            </font>            <table width="140" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="ekemel_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="kem2cont.jpg" width="140" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="ekemel_3.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     <i>James Abbott McNeill Whistler</i>, Frederick MacMonnies, 1931.

In the 1920s, when he was in his seventies, French               executed four busts for The Hall of Fame. Among them is <i>Edgar               Allan Poe</i> (elected 1910), whose physiognomy and tight, off-centered               scarf reflect the poet's difficult life and ominous subject matter.               Frederick MacMonnies, another important American sculptor, lived               in France for years, and even had his own &quot;school&quot; in               Giverny to which American students flocked for instruction from               the revered &quot;master.&quot; Appropriately, among one of three               of his busts is the portrait of expatriate painter <i>James Abbott               McNeill Whistler</i> (elected 1930) modeled in MacMonnies characteristically               animated style. </p>            <p>Other sculptors who created original work to the monument include,               but are not limited to Herbert Adams, Robert Aitken, Chester Beach,               Alexander S. Calder, John Flanagan, James Earle Fraser, Laura Gardin               Fraser, Charles Grafly, Frances Grimes, Malvina Hoffman, Anna Hyatt               Huntington, Hermon A. MacNeil, Brenda Putnam, Lorado Taft and Adolph               Weinman. Each made their individual contribution to American sculpture.               Adams was critically acclaimed for his use of polychromy and the               feminine, ideal portraits of women he created. Recognized for her               superb animal sculpture, Huntington's <i>Joan of Arc</i> (1915)               was the first known heroic equestrian statue by a woman. MacNeil               spent over a decade studying and executing sculpture of American               Indian people and themes. Author of the first comprehensive survey               of American nineteenth century sculptors and their oeuvre (published               1903), Taft was an ardent critic of modern art, although his own               work was characterized by simple, abstract forms. </p>            <p>From the group, one of the more masterfully executed busts is Laura               Gardin Fraser's portrait of <i>Mary Lyon</i> (elected 1905), the               early nineteenth century pioneer in women's higher education. The               flatness of the face and the minimal use of detail in the hair and               dress reveal the controlled craftsmanship of this sculptor. </p>            </font>            <table width="133" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="ekemel_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="kem3cont.jpg" width="133" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="ekemel_4.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     <i>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</i>, James Earle Fraser, 1926.

Certainly the most influential, prolific and dedicated American               sculptor of the late-nineteenth century, Saint-Gaudens is best known               for his standing Lincoln in Chicago Park and the equestrian statue               of General Sherman placed at the 59th Street entrance to Central               Park in New York City. James Earle Fraser, sculptor of the popular               <i>End of the Trail</i>, portrayed the eminent artist as a powerful               and virile individual, emphasized by the broadness and musculature               of his naked torso. At the same time, his brooding eyes and reflective               countenance reveal a man of creativity and contemplation. Saint-Gaudens'               work is represented by the replica busts of Abraham Lincoln (elected               1900) and <i>William Tecumseh Sherman</i> (elected 1905). </p>            <p>The Hall of Fame for Great Americans sadly continues to suffer               from insufficient funding in spite of many important reasons, both               aesthetic and historical, why it should receive the financial attention               it deserves to secure it for longevity. The monument is under the               directorship of Ralph Rourke, an Emmy-award winning producer and               former Public Affairs Officer at NYU, who honorably is committed               to preserving its original function as an educational and inspirational               tool for students and visitors alike. </p>            <p><b>What I didn't mention in the article:</b></p>            <p>There was much that I learned about the history and current state               of the monument in writing this brief article that was not appropriate               or necessary to mention. (I also discovered more primary material               after writing the article.) It was also not important for me to               outline documents, sources and archives, which I wish to do here               and at the end of this paper. For one, I hope it will show the extent               of information that exists on this subject and how little has been               done with it on the scholarly level. </p>            <p>Perhaps, it would also be appropriate to ask why hasn't anything               scholarly been written on The Hall of Fame and why has it virtually               been disregarded by researchers interested in public art? I should               also qualify that when I say the work has been &quot;neglected,&quot;               a word I use in the title of this paper, I specifically refer to               the degree the monument has been ignored by academia - apparently               no serious scholarship on the work has been done. It seems to have               not merited a dissertation topic in any discipline, an article in               a serious journal, including an art history periodical, or the focus               of a book. (I should note that my bibliography is not exhaustive,               so if my search has not come up with something relevant, I certainly               apologize for the omission and hope to learn what it might be. Also               because there was no abstract on file in the database on Alice Louisa               Dement, &quot;The higher education of Hall-of-Fame Americans,&quot;               Ph.D. diss., Stanford U, 1950, I could not determine at this time               if her subject relates to the Bronx monument.) </p>            <p>A few magazine articles in the last decade have featured the monument,               but are hardly substantial in the scholarly sense. The articles               tend to be of a cultural or popular nature, give basic facts, mention               other halls of fame and reflect on the notion of fame and how it               is perceived today in comparison to the past. One of the more informed               articles is by Philip M. Katz, &quot;Valhalla in the Bronx,&quot;               which appeared in <i>CultureFront</i> magazine (Summer 1998), a               publication of the New York Council of Humanities. Katz weaves together               the history and current purposes of the monument with his own personal               reflections in a sympathetic manner toward his subject. </p>            <p>There are certainly any number of approaches that can be taken               in writing about this monument. It could be considered from the               angle of its artistic merit, place in American art and architecture,               identity as an American Renaissance monument (I focus on this aspect               below), as a public monument, as a work on a college campus, as               a patriotic and national symbol, not to mention the notions of fame               and hero-worship in America, the issues of race, gender and multiculturalism               (these issues have been raised - see &quot;Sources and Documentation               Notes&quot;), the question of federal funding, and the Preservation               Movement. These are only a few of the &quot;topics&quot; from which               The Hall of Fame could be considered. From a strictly art historical               angle, it would certainly be of value to examine the European precedents               and prototypes that influenced the American conception of the country's               first hall of fame. Along the same lines, it would be of interest               to compare this group of &quot;worthies&quot; with earlier portrait               art collections in America of distinguished subjects. </p>            <p>My own interest in the immediate future may only take me to further               uncover the role the National Sculpture Society had in the choice               of sculptors chosen for the busts and the sculpture as a group.               It was not only that my audience would be sculptors that I chose               to focus on the sculptors, but that in doing a bibliographic search,               I found that the sculpture of the monument has virtually been ignored.               Most of the magazine articles that I have come across dating back               to the installation of the first busts either do not mention the               sculptors of the busts, or just cite their names. (The first bust               to be installed was of Horace Mann, unveiled May 1907 - the sculptor               is identified as unknown and the work was a replica; it was replaced               by an original work by Adolph A. Weinman in May 1930.) The focus               in the print media has been, from the start, on the subjects of               the busts, the honorees, and this pattern continues to the present.               I'm not going to say that all the busts are of the highest caliber,               but certainly there a number of noteworthy examples of portraiture               in bronze, and as a group, they deserve both popular and scholarly               attention. </p>            <p>In addition, there is a whole history behind this monument, documented               in scores of newspaper articles and editorial notices - the inauguration               itself generated &quot;thousands&quot; - to be pulled together and               examined. Like many other American monuments from the late-nineteenth               century or turn-of-the century, the coverage on The Hall of Fame               has run the gamut from over-exposure to virtual neglect. This degree               of popular interest to disinterest in itself speaks to many issues               and demonstrates that the monument's history spans the changing               tastes, movements, and values of an entire century. </p>            <p>Through an examination of the articles a fuller picture of the               monument's selection of nominees, the electoral process, the dedication               ceremonies, the celebrations and installations could be brought               to light. A point of interest is the trumpeters at the inaugural               ceremonies where a group of women wearing togas and braided hair               walked triumphantly in the processional. The monument, with its               Beaux-Arts style architecture was certainly harking back symbolically               to a time, particularly classical times when life might have seemed               purer and somewhat heroic. It would be interesting to know what               the public thought of the monument and the level of patriotic feeling               that was invoked by its dedication, which took place on Memorial               Day, May 30, 1901. </p>            <p>Needless to say, I've only touched on some of the contexts in which               The Hall of Fame for Great Americans could be approached. Without               a doubt there exists ample primary sources and other resources for               further research, investigation and discussion on this monument.               (At the end of the paper I briefly outline some of these sources.)             </p>            <p><b>Why The Hall of Fame is an American Renaissance monument: </b></p>            <p> The Hall of Fame for Great Americans was conceived in the spirit               of the American Renaissance and is truly an American Renaissance               monument. It therefore shares many of the main characteristics that               define any American Renaissance monument and the intentions, vision,               and purposes in its creation are closely aligned with other prominent               public projects and artistic works of this period. </p>            <p>The American Renaissance was a period, a movement, and a way of               thinking that prevailed over the art and architecture of America               and the social and intellectual life of Americans between the third-quarter               of the nineteenth century to the first-quarter of the twentieth               century. The exact time-frame of this period is something of a debate.               (My discussion of this period relies, in part, on the important               work, <i>American Renaissance 1876-1917</i> published 1979 in conjunction               with the exhibition of the same title given by the Brooklyn Museum.)             </p>            <p>I will briefly discuss below some of the major characteristics               that identify an American Renaissance monument, project, plan, building,               or other work of art or architecture in relation to The Hall of               Fame. I will also point out some of the main factors - &quot;the               genteel tradition&quot;, nationalism and civic pride - that propelled               the movement and the creation of The Hall of Fame. </p>            <p>An unofficial group - referred to under the description of the               &quot;genteel tradition - of intellectuals, writers, educators,               artists, along with businessmen, sought to educate, morally uplift               and civilize the American people through art, education and civic               beautification. Among this group can be included Henry Mitchell               MacCracken, who started out as a philosophy professor in 1884 at               New York University (then the University of the City of New York)               and progressed to the position of Chancellor in 1891, a post he               held till 1910. As an educator and The Hall of Fame's originator,               he sought to embrace America's past by distinguishing both its leaders               and its private citizens. </p>            <p>MacCracken was joined in his mission by like-minded men, those               that undoubtedly shared the values of the &quot;genteel tradition.&quot;               For the first election in 1900, names were submitted by the general               public through solicitation in newspapers. From this list the New               York University Senate members narrowed down the candidates. The               final selection was in the hands of a group of about 100 people               nationwide - the electors - who were distinguished by such divisions               as &quot;University and College Presidents,&quot; &quot;Professors,&quot;               &quot;Men of Affairs&quot; and &quot;High Public Officials.&quot;               It would certainly be interesting to look more closely at these               group of men, their mutual associations and how they were chosen.             </p>            <p>As the first hall of fame in America and called the &quot;National               Pantheon&quot; by journalists, the work was certainly conceived               as a public monument that would arouse national, as well as civic               sentiments. One of the criteria for candidacy in the original Constitution               (later overruled) was that only native-born Americans could be elected.               Nationalism was another major driving force in the production of               American Renaissance public monuments and civic projects. What place               did America have in the civilization of the world? What was its               present position and how could it be maintained? If America was               a great nation, should not its cities, its art and people reflect               that greatness? These were some of the questions that propelled               the re-evaluation of the nation as a whole, as well as its urban               areas and their populace. </p>            <p>The vision that MacCracken saw for The Hall of Fame was a monument               that would honor not only political leaders, such as George Washington               (the only honoree voted in unanimously), but Americans who distinguished               themselves in every field (one of the categories allowed for &quot;miscellaneous&quot;               candidates). It was believed that visitors from all over the nation               would look to those chosen men (and some women) and be inspired               to higher values, particularly patriotism, nationalism and civic-pride.               This honor role would serve as models of citizenry and greatness.               (The notion of &quot;greatness&quot; was itself being redefined.)               In addition, the Constitution from the start (but with much public               opposition) allowed for the election of Southern figures (Robert               E. Lee was elected in 1900 by 68 votes), which underscored the intent               for the monument to somehow unify the nation. MacCracken wrote in               the 1901 book he authored on the monument: </p>            <blockquote>It [the group of electors] will know no South or North;               no West or East. Its calm, clear judgment will overrule sectional               and partisan outcry. (84)</blockquote>            <p>Its importance to the city as a landmark was not lost on MacCracken,               nor on the many editorial and newspaper writers who expressed civic               pride in The Hall of Fame's location in New York City. The American               Renaissance period can rightly be credited with continuing the goals               of the City Beautiful Movement (which started in the mid-1850's)               in the creation and decoration of America's metropolitan areas.               New Yorkers in this time witnessed major aesthetic changes to their               city. Major monuments with elaborate decoration and buildings with               architectural ornamentation and allegorical figures were being erected               before their eyes. College campuses, particularly that of Columbia               University and New York University's uptown campus (on which The               Hall of Fame stands) with their complex of Beaux-Arts style buildings               were almost small cities in themselves. Monuments such as The Hall               of Fame, visited by thousands each year, no doubt evoked a sense               of pride in New York City, the intention of its creator and others               with similar hopes. </p>            <p>Stylistically and in terms of landscape design, The Hall of Fame               and its adjacent buildings are primary examples of American Renaissance               architecture. While the style of the American Renaissance was eclectic               most of the art referenced was mainly (but not exclusively) European.               In the case of architecture the source was particularly French Beaux-Arts               or more generally classicism. Intellectual, historic and artistic               associations were made to the Italian Renaissance, which served               as the &quot;ideal&quot; period of civilization and the predecessor               to America's own greatness as a nation. The colonnade terrace of               The Hall of Fame was created in a Beaux-Arts style as part of an               ensemble of other buildings conceived within a total planned environment               that took into consideration its surrounding landscape. Early photographs               show, for example, that in the back of the monument, paths lead               to its first level interior (to be discussed below) and the superb               fountain in the back of the monument. Each part of the ensemble,               the three buildings and the colonnade, work harmoniously in style,               movement, and purpose. </p>            <p>The works and projects generated during the American Renaissance               are particularly distinguished not only by style but also by how               they were executed and the materials used. During this period a               large-scale work or project was, in many cases, collaborative, meaning               it was intended to be or was actually executed by many individuals               - architects, painters, sculptors, craftsmen, artisans. This was               certainly the case in the quintessential American Renaissance project,               the World's Columbian Exposition (1893), which provoked Augustus               Saint-Gaudens to remark, &quot;This is the greatest meeting of artists               since the fifteenth century.&quot; Corresponding with the variety               of creative artists involved was the use of different mediums to               create a &quot;total work of art.&quot; For example, an American               Renaissance mansion would have brought together architecture, painting,               sculpture, mural painting, landscape gardening, stained glass, mosaics,               ceramics, and other decorative arts. </p>            <p>While The Hall of Fame realized the vision of bringing together               two of the main arts, sculpture and architecture, it fell short               of actually incorporating painting, particularly, mural painting,               which was a prominent feature in a number of public and private               buildings during this period. The idea of including mural painting               in the area named the &quot;Museum of The Hall of Fame&quot; was               seriously discussed, though never realized. (Ralph Rourke, the current               Director stated that, to his knowledge, the proposed mural project               &quot;never came to fruition.&quot;) </p>            <p>The first level or substructure (under the colonnade) was officially               to be used as a museum as explained by MacCracken in his 1901 book:             </p>            <blockquote>The granite edifice which will serve as the foundation               of The Hall of Fame shall be named the Museum of The Hall of Fame.               Its final exclusive use shall be the commemoration of the great               Americans whose names are inscribed in the colonnade above, by the               preservation and exhibition of portraits and other important mementos               of these citizens. The six rooms and the long corridor shall in               succession be set apart to this exclusive use. The room to be first               used shall be named the Washington Gallery, and shall be set apart               so soon as ten or more portraits of the persons inscribed shall               be accepted for permanent preservation by the University. . . .               Statues and busts of the great Americans chosen may be assigned               places either in the Museum of The Hall of Fame or in the Hall itself.               (9-10) </blockquote>            <p>The Museum walls would have been decorated with murals as the following               paper given by the Society of Mural Painters reveals: </p>            <blockquote>The Committee on Civic Buildings of the National Society               of Mural Painters, having carefully considered the possibilities               of the embellishment of the Museum of The Hall of Fame by appropriate               mural painting, hereby makes the following suggestions: That it               is eminently fitting that, in a commemoration of national greatness               such as The Hall of Fame, the three great arts, Architecture, Sculpture,               and Mural Painting, should collaborate, not only to perpetuate the               memory of the great men of the nation for all time, but also to               serve as an example of monumental art in America of today. . . .               We would suggest that . . . the central gallery, which has the largest               uninterrupted frieze-line, be taken up first, and a painting be               placed here, chiefly allegorical, typifying <i>American progress,               the ideals of the nation, and its place in the history of civilization</i>.               (Reprinted in MacCracken, 1901, 71) </blockquote>            <p>The Museum was to house painting, sculpture, as well as artifacts               and archives that would grow into a collection of <i>Americana</i>,               an example of how the monument would claim America's history and               advance American culture. The subject of the proposed mural for               the central gallery would have certainly expressed the major principles               that galvanized the American Renaissance movement. (Also, according               Rourke, the Museum housed a famous clock collection that was given               over to the Smithsonian and the largest room was once used as a               reserve reading room.) </p>            <p>Finally, The Hall of Fame was not publicly funded, nor was it paid               for by the university, but rather it was financially sponsored by               Helen Miller Gould, daughter of Jay Gould, who made his fortune               in the railroad industry. The American Renaissance was a period               when wealthy Americans, such as the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers               were trying to establish themselves as the stately and noble families               of America. Their private homes, whether Fifth Avenue mansions or               summer retreats were conceived and decorated by scores of artists               working together to create harmonious outdoor and indoor living               spaces. For the public good and perhaps to elevate their own social               standing, they spent extensively in the fields of art and education,               financing public works and projects, such as major museums, libraries               and monuments as The Hall of Fame for Great Americans. </p>            <p><b>The current state of affairs:</b></p>            <p>The monument has not been entirely ignored in the last few years,               particularly this past year since the centennial ceremonies have               generated publicity (the Centennial Gala took place on June 12,               2000). Once called the &quot;Hall of Shame,&quot; editorial, magazine               and newspaper articles are being written with a much more sympathetic               and even patriotic tone toward the monument and its plight for increased               funding. Since restoration and preservation was done in the1980s               and early 1990s, the condition of the busts and the colonnade is               good, though continuous maintenance is needed. </p>            <p>Ralph Rourke, the Director of The Hall of Fame, is familiar with               both the history of New York University and educational projects.               He served as a Public Affairs Officer at NYU for years and is also               an Emmy-Award winning producer for &quot;Sunrise Semester,&quot;               which was a nationally syndicated educational program that ran for               twenty-five years. In 1987 he was hired by Bronx Community College               as a media consultant, and two years later, in the fall of 1989,               he took on the role of Director of the monument. Over the course               of six years he raised at least $600,000 in state grant funds, when               such funds were available. Under Governor Pataki state grants have               been frozen. The monument only received $10,000 last year in state               money, what Rourke has called a &quot;token grant.&quot; Rourke               conveyed that the American Heritage Trust, a division of The Department               of Parks, The State Dormitory Authority, as well as the New York               State Democratic Delegation to the Assembly, have all contributed               in some way to preserving the monument. </p>            <p>What Rourke seems to be aiming toward is finding a way to have               continuous, uninterrupted funding so that the monument can receive               regular upkeep and function as a viable institution for the community               and the nation as a whole. His goal is to bring The Hall of Fame               &quot;into the twenty-first century,&quot; while maintaining and               fostering the original aims of education and inspiration. </p>            <p>This summer <i>The Daily News</i> (June 11, 2000) did a piece focusing               on the four nominees (Louis D. Brandeis, Clara Barton, Luther Burbank,               Andrew Carnegie) who have yet to have their busts commissioned and               installed and the organizations that have failed them. Rourke related               that the four busts not yet executed were originally supposed to               be underwritten by individual organizations that made pledges. At               this point these groups have not fulfilled their original promises.               If they or other organizations don't come through, the tradition               of underwriting the busts will have to be broken, Rourke said. Each               bust is currently estimated to at least $25,000 a piece. </p>            <p>There seems to be good news on the horizon for The Hall of Fame.               As an outcome of <i>The Daily News</i> story, Fernando Ferrer, the               Bronx Borough President announced at the Centennial Gala that he               is offering a half-million dollar matching grant &quot;from the               next capital budget.&quot; If the other half can be raised, the               total sum of one million dollars would be an incredible boost for               the monument, which is visited by approximately 25,000 people each               year. </p>            <p><b>Concluding notes:</b></p>            <p>In these notes I hope I've conveyed my enthusiasm for this monument,               that I actually like it and care about its longevity. If this sounds               odd, it's the only way, aside from contributing these notes, to               express my own feelings toward what may otherwise be a very neglected               piece of American history. The only thing is that it is not dead               history. </p>            <p>Through visiting it, researching and writing about it and hopefully               discussing it in some future forum, scholars and writers can turn               the tide of neglect to a more positive and focused sense of purpose.             </p>            <p>Anyone with questions or comments, may write to <a href="mailto:ekem@aol.com">               ekem@aol.com</a>.

Anyone interested in the medallions might visit the             National Sculpture Society (by appointment). Their office has a binder             with published leaflets on the individual sculptors which reproduce             the obverse (portrait of the honoree) and reverse (a design related             to the subject's achievement) of the medal.

What is certain though is             that the actual structure, the semi-circular colonnade was not his             conception, but Stanford White's. MacCracken repeated in several sources             how the idea of The Hall of Fame came about. In a published interview             given around the time of his retirement in 1910, MacCracken was quoted             as saying that initially &quot;There was no educational reason for             it [the semi-circular structure],&quot; which compelled him to think             of one in order to justify the cost of its construction. MacCracken             who had studied and lived in Germany for a brief period in the late             1860's noted that he &quot;remembered the two Halls of Fame at Regensberg             and Munich,&quot; and that the structure conceived by the architect             &quot;might be used as an American Hall of Fame.&quot; (&quot;So Says             Chancellor MacCracken on the Eve of Retiring,&quot; <i>New-York Daily             Tribune</i>, Mar. [1910?] - for this article see scrapbook at University             Archives.) It should be stressed that the original guidelines (in             the Constitution) only specified for the possibility of including             busts or statues in the Hall or Museum. The main intent was to fulfill             the installation of memorial bronze tablets along the colonnade. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">For Parisian precedents, particularly the Panthon, see June Hargrove               <i>The Statues of Paris : an Open Air Pantheon</i> (New York: Vendome               Press, 1990). </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Beside the German and French references, comparisons in articles               were also made to Westminster Abbey. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">For early American precedents see Brandon Brame Fortune, &quot;Portraits               of virtue and Genius: Pantheons of Worthies and Public Portraiture               in the Early American Republic, 1780-1920,&quot; Ph.D. diss., U               of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 1986.
