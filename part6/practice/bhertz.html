This               shift has yielded a whole new generation of architecture. Frank               Gehry's much celebrated Guggenheim Museum Bilbao completed in 1997               is a convenient example for illustrating the particular effect of               digital imagining on new building design. Gehry's several quick               drawn sketches on hotel stationary made in 1991 directly after his               visit to the museum's present site mark the genesis of the building's               monstrous beauty. The sketches are rough but already suggest the               shape, feeling, and imagery of the end product. His first competition               model already exhibited the museum's cubistic exterior surfaces               replacing the sinuous line of the linear sketches with bulk and               mass to form the undulating shapes of ship, water landscape, and               tower. The initial conceptualization of the museum's sculptural               skin was achieved through model making and a computer program called               Catia which was originally developed for the French aerospace industry               aided in the refinement and engineering.</font>             <p> <font class="second">The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao is a strange               belated example of Analytic Cubism, a post-modern enlargement and               no less than a transposed remake of the tenets of Cubism. Moreover,               it finally fulfills the ambitions set out by the architectural modernists               of the 1920s, when the historian Sigfried Giedion suggested that               the architects were quot;looking to cubist painting to find a model               for spatial experience that would be appropriate to modern architecture.&quot;               The corollaries are particularly suggestive when looking at Braque's,               <i>Harbor in Normandy</i> and <i>Fishing Boats</i>, both from 1909,               works that in their time represented a breaking point for a new               visuality of real things in space. Conversely it is also possible               to trace the origins of Cubism to architectural form. In the summer               of 1909 Picasso took a sojourn to Horta de Ebro, Spain, where, influenced               by the cubic forms of the vernacular architecture, he painted his               first analytic cubist works including <i>The Reservoir, Horta</i>.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Why is Gehry, one of post-modernism's masters,               borrowing from such an old and worn out model of modernism? Is it               ironic that he fulfills the cubist model so successfully thanks               to capabilities of computer software? Why is there so much analog               sensibility in his digitally-generated form? Gehry has boldly veered               into the realm of sculpture before with his repeated renditions               of fish and snakes, most notably in works such as the Fishdance               restaurant in Kobe, Japan, 1987 and his fish lamp designs of Colorcore               Formica. Influenced by his artist friends such as Richard Serra               and Claes Oldenburg, he has unashamedly borrowed from the visual               canon of painting and sculpture.</font></p>            <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="bhertz_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="her2cont.jpg" width="150" height="102" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="bhertz_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Mark Bennett, <i>M.A.S.H.</i>, 1995, Ink/pencil on graph vellum,                     24x36", Collection of Suzanne and Howard Feldman, Photo: Paula                     Goldman.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">But why spend the first part of this essay               on the exhibition, &quot;Transposed: Analogs of Built Space,&quot;               which presents the work of visual arts who adapt the idiom of architectural               models and plans, by summarizing a master work by a famous architect?               Whereas Gehry may be fascinated with a now defunct ideology in the               visual arts (which he's reinvigorated under the auspices of architecture),               more and more contemporary artists are mining the detritus of earlier               paradigms and practices of architects. Why is this fascination with               the &quot;sister&quot; other, the oft paired art and architecture,               blossoming now? Trying to grasp the condition of architecture, reverentially               imitating, using and even abusing it is the very thing that is sparking               new work by young artists impersonating the practice of architecture.               Their work apes the visual language, symbolic functions, ideals,               and construction methods of architecture. Yet their work is not               architecture. The six artists in Transposed: Analogs of Built Space               ease their task of creating an approximate equivalent to architecture               by creating work in the idiom of models and plans, forms which are               already referents for larger built projects. These works are spin               offs, interpretations, almost dalliances in conversation with architecture's               past. The six artists-Mark Bennett, Steven Brower, Javier Cambre,               Toshihiro Komatsu, Elke Lehmann and Sarah Oppenheimer-are, like               their paper architect counterparts, freed from the demands of functionality.               Their handmade works resist the virtual world of cyber architecture               and their practice is also distinct from the research architect               who is primarily interested in experimental or theoretical explorations.</font></p>            <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="bhertz_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="her3cont.jpg" width="175" height="122" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="bhertz_3.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Steven Brower, <i>Falling Lumber</i> (detail), 1997, Plastic,                     wood, paint, metal, photos, paper, dimensions variable, Collection                     of the artist, Photo: Stephan Freid.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">In the past architects used the model and               plan as a tool in the design process. For the most part, architects               now use these forms for presentation purposes to promote their ideas               to clients and other interested parties. The model, which by definition               is a referent for something else, shifts the body's time-space relationship               through its miniaturized scale. In real space we cannot experience               a view from inside the building and a view from outside the building               simultaneously. We experience things from a variety of spatial positions               as we move through space. But the model presents the whole almost               all at once. It is more manageable than the fully sized thing, more               illusory, more tentative, and can live in the realm of the incomplete               more easily. Shrinking and miniaturization combine &quot;with imitation,               with the second-handedness and distance of the model.&quot; The               works in Transposed, make literal reference to a specific original               that can be as fictive as Bennett's plans of television houses or               as real as Lehmann's one third scale model of the director's office               at the Sculpture Center. Each artist is therefore reworking an image               already encoded with a specific history. This relationship between               original and its respondent grounds these works in the past. Like               Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao these works rely on historical               precedents in order to be fully alive in the present.</font>             <p> <font class="second">Each artist in Transposed has taken a unique               approach to the issues raised above. Mark Bennett builds a fiction               out of a fiction by designing plans of television houses using information               gleaned from TV studio sets, neighborhood scenes, and dialogue.               After repeated viewing of serial shows such as The Brady Bunch and               Bewitched he maps out the building and surrounding landscape that               spatially frames the action of the characters. He redoubles on the               fictional space and concretizes it. However, as he has not been               especially trained in architectural drawing, his renditions render               another kind of falseness, an inaccurate account of that which doesn't               exist. Yet drawn with a close enough approximation to the clues               presented on TV, he has put together fragments that are barely perceivable               to the average viewer. He takes advantage of the nature of the plan-to               give an overview of the various rooms and floors which are impossible               to experience simultaneously.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Whereas Bennett concretizes fictions Javier               Cambre overlays his own interpretation onto an architectural source               with a role in a well known film. His representations of the Casa               Malaparte (1938-42), a modernist Italian villa that sits on top               of a cliff in Capri, are dependent on its function as the central               location for Jean-Luc Godard's film Contempt (1963) starring Brigitte               Bardot, Michel Piccoli and Jack Parlance. The stucco Pompeiian red               villa was designed by its owner, the writer Curzio Malaparte best               known for his book Kaputt (1946), a fictional account of his journalistic               experiences during World War II. The film also features a cameo               appearance by Fritz Lang, the director of the German Expressionist               film Metropolis (1926). Contempt is ostensibly about a French couple,               a screenwriter and his wife, and their relationship to an American               film producer. The artist has stated: &quot;I believe Godard chose               the house as a site for his movie because he was making an analogy               between the failure-tragedy of modernism and the failure-tragedy               of a contemporary couple and at the same time the tragedy of filmmaking.               Contempt is a movie about making a movie about the Greek tragedy               of Ulysses.&quot; Cambre's project is conceptually situated on top               of these layers of this referential evidence. Using furniture, prints,               and a brochure, his installation uses the plan of the villa to represent               masculine desire for power and the female character's lack of independent               identity and contempt for her husband's ineffectualness. The tension               of this heterosexual dynamic is represented in a repeated motif,               which depicts the phallic shape of the building with a sharp point.               The form penetrates and is surrounded by the wavy lines of the contours               of land and elevation. The villa is simultaneously revealed to be               both a boat floating at sea and a signifier of sex. The building               is more and less than itself. It becomes an object whose physicality               is secondary to the uses the film makes of it and its availability               as a symbol of desire.</font>            <p> <font class="second">While Bennett's and Cambre's plans and models               respond to fictional narratives, Steven Brower's projects mine the               historiography of a building's reception and biography to create               skewed adaptations of specific canonical works. His humorous detailed               models disarm the sanctity of high architecture. A big fan of Buckminster               Fuller Brower created Messiah Complex (1997) as a homage both to               Fuller's inventive geodesic domes of the 1940s and his iconoclasm.               Reflecting on the cultural history of the dome, Brower incorporates               two adaptive uses into one model. The top half depicts a comfortable               rural home replete with wood stove and weaving loom and the bottom               half depicts an underground survivalist barrack. The two halves               were inspired by the two factions that embraced the design-hippies               seeking affordable, do-it-yourself shelters that blended with their               back-to-nature aesthetics and the United States military looking               for solutions for quick-to-build bunkers to house victims of war               and disaster. Brower grew up in part in rural West Virginia in a               simple shed style house that was pretty dilapidated when the family               arrived from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. The family pastime               was to improve the house by fixing up the existing structure and               making additions. The result was a confusing mess, but it blended               well with its rural surroundings. These childhood experiences are               the basis of Brower's house and fictional housing development Falling               Lumber (1997), a spoof on the most revered American house, Frank               Lloyd Wright's Falling Water (1936) as well as Wright's foray into               mass produced low income housing design, the Usonian houses (1936-1953).               Plans, photographs, and a brochure accompany two models, one of               the house and another of a planned community, as if prospective               buyers would want to buy a copy of Brower's fictive speculation               house based on his family home.</font></p>            <table width="111" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="bhertz_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="her4cont.jpg" width="111" height="175" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="bhertz_4.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Toshihiro Kamatsu, <i>Artist and His Studio</i>, Amsterdam,                     1996, Photographic documenation of wearable model of ATELIER                     217, Photo dimension: 29x19", Model: Plywood, polystyrene,                     plexiglass mirror, Model dimension: 15x21x27", Collection                     of the artist, Photo: Tanja and Roderick Henderson.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">Toshihiro Komatsu's work is about the locations               he has encountered, built space and nature. Since leaving his hometown               of Hamamatsu City to attend university in 1991 Komatsu has been               on a nomadic journey, first as a student in Tokyo, then as a post               graduate fellow at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam,               next as a graduate student at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts               and presently living in New York. Pieces of this journey have been               documented in his extensive explorations of the buildings in which               he has lived and worked, or those nearby. He defines his relationship               to each new place by investigating its particularities often creating               multiple works in response to a singular architectural case. While               in Amsterdam (1994-96) Komatsu created a variety of works where               he realigned the traditional spatial relationships between inside               and outside and transposed the scale and location of his studio.               In each medium-model, photography, collage, drawing-Komatsu represented               another perspective on the singular space of the studio. His investigations               took the form of installations in the studio and scaled-down replicas               of it in varying sizes placed in different situations. In his 1996               series, Artist and His Studio (a title which coyly makes reference               to Rembrandt's paintings of the same name), a performer walks around               the city with the model of the studio over his head posing in front               of various emblematic sites such as a windmill. The studio is metaphorically               lifted from its original situation on the third floor of an institutional               building, and takes on the wandering identity of the artist's nomadic               condition. In several other works, the window, that liminal element,               is the open channel for bringing light, air and sky inside thereby               dissipating the feeling of containment. For Atelier 217 (1995) Komatsu               opened up the paper scale model of the studio into a flat shape               and created a cut out that can be folded back into a box. Images               of day sky and night sky, representing nature and infinite space               contradict the limiting qualities of the box. Komatsu's various               works reveal both an attraction and aversion to the limits of built               space in light of continual transience.</font></p>            <table width="129" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="bhertz_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="her5cont.jpg" width="129" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="bhertz_5.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Elke Lehmann, <i>Office</i>, 2000, dimensions variable (destroyed),                     Photo: Bill Orcutt.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">Elke Lehmann's site specific installation               Office (2000) sets up a phenomenological situation between the existing               spaces of the Sculpture Center and a constructed box. Initially               the viewer sees a raised box with an &quot;L&quot;-shaped side opening               protruding into the space of the gallery and then a window with               a view to the director's office on the other side of the gallery               wall. The box is a suspended one third scale model of the office.               Once inside, the interior of the replica fits snuggly around the               body with the imaginary floor starting around the viewer's knees.               The intimacy of the enclosure effects one's kinesthetic sense of               space and the relative qualities of bigness and smallness. An encounter               between gallery visitor and gallery staff may (or may not) occur.               However, the gallery visitor can look into the office with its desk,               shelves, books, computer, phone, etc. in full view. The view from               the director's side is totally different. The window allows for               a partial view of the gallery, an intimate view of the interior               of the box and possibly the person who may stand inside it. The               window is used to full metaphoric function revealing the contents               of the space on the other side of the wall. It sets up a situation               for expectation and voyeurism, while making the participant self-conscious               about being looked at, with the added anxiety of the possibility               of a close encounter interrupting the director's daily routine.               Lehmann's installation is both a scale model, and an intervention               of the institutional art space-a strategy developed by Conceptual               artists of the late-1960s and early 1970s such as Michael Asher               and Daniel Buren. Sarah Oppenheimer's Terrain Projects (1999) are               abstract diagrammatic representations of the public spaces of cities.               Her representations are based on sections of the urban grid in midtown               Manhattan. Not focused on an individual building or room she explores               urban terrain as a spatial concept based on the density of human               movement in the built environment. The structure of geographic space               is represented in three dimensions through the patterning and grouping               of relief building structures on interlocking hexagonal and diamond               shaped tiles. A graphic mapping of the human patterns of movement               is set onto a dense color-coded diagram that becomes abstract through               the layering of specific strategic information. Oppenheimer has               taken the inspiration for her approach to mapping the pattern of               the ebb and flow of pedestrians from a rather sinister source, military               manuals on tactics and strategies for successful attacks on cities.               According to Oppenheimer's scheme the correlation between the task               of the planner and military strategist is not very far apart as               mass human behavior and it's regulation is very much part of the               urban planner's job. She achieves a complexly coded abstract image               through a scientific approach to urban planning.</font></p>            <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="bhertz_6.html" target="_blank"><img src="her6cont.jpg" width="175" height="106" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="bhertz_6.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Sarah Oppenheimer, <i>Terain Development Project Stage #3</i>,                     1999, dimensions variable Collection of the artist, Photo:                     Bill Orcutt.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">By engaging the idiom of architectural models               and plans, the visual artists in Transposed reconceive already existing               places with an acute sensitivity to the cultural specificity of               place-domestic architecture, studio and exhibition space, or urban               grid.
