When         erected on the campus of Queens College in Flushing, New York, in August         of 1994, it instantly became, at nearly 27 feet and 75,000 pounds, one         of the largest public sculptures in New York City. It engages the functions         of commemoration, awareness, and enlightenment that monuments are expected         to perform, but also adopts less conventional purposes and meanings, particularly         the experience of abstract form and philosophical speculation, that might         be considered the realm of high modernism but not public memorials. Completely         non-representational and essentially Minimalist in spirit, Crawford's         column could become a test case of the viability of abstraction as meaningful         public art in the aftermath of controversies surrounding public art projects         that have included, among others, Richard Serra's <i>Tilted Arc</i>. In         also continues a tradition of symbolic, expressive meaning in Minimalism         long after the movement ceased to dominate what was considered radical         in the visual arts, as seen in such well-known works as Maya Lin's <i>Vietnam         Veterans Memorial</i>.</font> </p>      <p> <font class="second"><i>Queens College Marker</i> is a column formed         by three vertically stacked blocks of solid carbon steel that are unpainted,         unpolished, and in the process of rusting. At 26.5 feet in height, the         column is nearly three stories tall. Each block is nearly equal in length         to the others, and all are vaguely oval in their cross-sections. The column         never exceeds three feet in width. It is placed in the center of a slightly         convex, circular mound of grass twenty feet in diameter. This area of         grass is located in a concrete walkway which constitutes a small plaza         sandwiched between two large buildings on the campus, Rosenthal Library         (to the west) and Powdermaker Hall (to the east). This plaza is located         in the middle of a north-south axis of pedestrian traffic established         by entrances on opposite ends of the campus. Several feet to the west         of the sculpture but still located on the circle of grass are five boulders,         each one approximately two feet high and three to four feet in width.</font>       <p> <font class="second">Crawford has said that &quot;there is a lot of         sculptural poetry in how things are joined together. This installation         is not about tightening a few bolts.&quot; <small><sup>1</sup></small>         The bottom segment of the sculpture, forged without benefit of machinery         which would create streamlined planes and contours, is a broad, squat         form, whose surface curves continually with no hard edges. This piece,         the least rusted of the three, is a dark gray, with scratch-like patches         of glowing orange rust scattered across its surface. The transitions from         segment to segment are accomplished by abutting or interpenetrating the         columns at different places along their bottom or top edges. Where two         segments abut and one hangs over the other slightly, the steel has been         rough- or hand-forged (it has not been shaped with machines); where two         segments smoothly interlock, the steel has been smooth-or machine-forged         (it has been shaped by machine).<small><sup>2</sup></small> The middle         segment has been forged in both ways. Three planar areas have been cut         down its eastern side. This gives this segment a leaner, more streamlined         quality, a sensation of rapid motion that helps to draw your eye farther         upward. The western side of this segment is continuously curved and is         oxidized to a rich orange hue. The top segment is entirely smooth-forged,         making it the sleekest, most geometric, most mechanical part of the sculpture.         Its entire surface is oxidized to a rich orange, making it seem the brightest         in hue. Five planar surfaces have been cut down its sides.</font>       <p> <font class="second">By being placed slightly off-center in a major         walkway on the campus, this steel tower can be seen so intimately that         the viewer can walk up and touch it, or it can be seen as remotely as         two hundred feet away. It can also be seen in fragments from many windows         in the two buildings which flank it. Although the fragmentary window views         do intrigue, they are not very satisfying because the full impact of the         work depends on viewing it in its entirety. From any distance the sculpture         adamantly yet gracefully makes its existence known. The solemn, poignant         presence of the sculpture cannot be ignored as it towers in the otherwise         bland but functional plaza.</font></p>      <table width="197" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="hharte_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="har2cont.jpg" width="197" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"> <a href="hharte_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>Queens               College Marker</i> in Situ. Photo: Herbert Hartel. </font></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font class="second">The proximity of the walkway affords convenient         views at ten to twenty feet away. When viewed from this distance, one         can achieve the most engaging sculptural experience the work permits.         The shifting orientation of the three segments, their variety of planar         surfaces, colors, and textures, and the transition from a rough-forged         surface at the bottom to a smooth-forged one at the top are visually exciting         and absorbing, offering a wide range of beautiful abstract sculptural         experiences. The possibilities are expanded by walking slowly around the         sculpture as you look at it continuously or repeatedly. In doing this         the work takes on new life, for changes in perspective provide changes         in shape, size, and the arrangement of forms. The marker seems to soar         to the sky, even though it is also firmly rooted in the soil. It seems         to twist in different directions from segment to segment, yet it is motionless.         Its steel surfaces can be dismally gray or brightly orange, as changes         in light alter changes in mood. At a distance of a few hundred feet the         sculpture is sometimes distilled to a dark silhouette. This effect is         especially noticeable at twilight or at night.</font>       <p> <font class="second">Crawford was born in 1953 in New York City to an         artistically-inclined family. His father was the Precisionist painter         Rawlston Crawford and his mother and two brothers are photographers.<small><sup>3</sup></small>         Ironically, Crawford gravitated toward sculpture, but a difference in         media does not assume a difference in sensibility. Crawford would agree,         for he credits his father with instilling in him a fascination with visual         structure and the belief that structure is essential to meaning.<small><sup>4</sup></small>         Crawford earned a B.F.A. in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of         Design in 1976 and then worked as an apprentice to blacksmiths in Italy         for ten years. As an apprentice blacksmith, Crawford learned pre-industrial,         manual techniques of working with metals in a sixteenth century, water-powered         forge, where he made farming tools.<small><sup>5</sup></small></font>       <p> <font class="second">Before apprenticing as a blacksmith, Crawford built         abstract figures out of wood logs.<small><sup>6</sup></small> Crawford         said that he chose to learn blacksmithing because he has long been interested         in tools.<small><sup>7</sup></small> In Italy, Crawford began to work         in iron (in return for his services to the blacksmiths he was able to         use the forge to make his own sculptures), and his work of this period         includes pieces which reflect the look and function of farm tools and         others which are more architectural in style. The architectural objects         include arched forms, forms held together by tension or compression, and         forms held together with iron pins serving as joints. They typically include         bold arrangements of a few block- or rod-like pieces of iron reaching         in various directions. Much of Crawford's work reveals his keen interest         in the physical characteristics of materials, and in the architectural,         mechanical, and industrial. Crawford's interest in structure extends beyond         the man-made to that found in nature, such as the structure of minerals,         including the geometric structure of iron pyrite crystals, which can be         described as fractals. These structures are evident in the spatial arrangements         of some of Crawford's sculptures. These visual explorations of structure         are for Crawford an attempt to find order and harmony in life. Important         examples of Crawford's work in iron prior to the Markers include <i>3         Legged Arch #7</i> (1984) and <i>Braced Form #16</i> (1984-86).</font>       <p> <font class="second"><i>Queens College Marker</i> was commissioned by         Queens College for its Benjamin Rosenthal Library, which opened in 1988,         in fulfillment of the Percent for Art Program of New York City. The committee         established to obtain art for the Rosenthal Library, headed by chief art         librarian Suzanna Simor, considered 11,000 artists and solicited 150 proposals         before choosing the proposal submitted by Crawford.<small><sup>8</sup></small>         The cost of the project was $100,000.<small><sup>9</sup></small> The sculpture         was constructed at Scot Forge in Spring Grove, Illinois, where it was         initially forged, and then at the Rose Corporation in Reading, Pennsylvania,         where the process of forging was completed.<small><sup>10</sup></small>         <i>Queens College Marker</i> is less commonly known as <i>Marker I-4</i>,         which for the sculptor means the fourth marker he has made in iron.<small><sup>11</sup></small>         Although the sculpture was installed as its basic design was described         by Crawford in his original proposal, as &quot;a tower of forged, machined         billets of steel&quot; with &quot;three interlocking pieces,&quot; it         underwent considerable change before installation. Crawford originally         planned for it to be placed on the opposite side of the library, in a         ravine one-story deep on the northwest corner of the building which flanks         the windows of the reading room in the first floor.<small><sup>12</sup></small>         At one time he also intended the sculpture to consist of four segments.         Crawford wanted one connection point visible to the viewers in the reading         room of each floor (they are directly overhead from floor to floor) as         the sculpture rose alongside the building to the fourth floor.<small><sup>13</sup></small>         Crawford thinks this plan had intriguing possibilities, but has no regrets         that the committee eventually decided to relocate the sculpture, a decision         which led him to drop the four-segment design in favor of the three-segment         plan.<small><sup>14</sup></small> Both decisions proved to be wise ones.         The original location for this work is secluded; no matter how effective         it may have been there, it would have been experienced by far fewer people.         If the sculpture consisted of four segments and therefore would have been         appropriately longer, it might have become disconcertingly tall.</font>       <p><font class="second"><i>Queens College Marker</i> is part of a series         of sculptures Crawford calls Markers, which he began making in the late         1980s. Crawford has made several markers in iron, tin, and wood. Some         are as small as scale models while many range in size from four to seven         feet tall. These works frequently consist of a few block- or slab-like         forms that are sometimes juxtaposed with or held aloft by a few rod-like         forms. The works feature both human and architectural proportions and         offer a rich array of abstract sculptural experiences due to the forthright         and intimate arrangements of their blunt, faintly geometric forms. Crawford's         first monumental, site-specific markers were the sculptures he designed         for Amherst College in 1990. These works are called Markers because they         refer to the desire of all people to produce enduring evidence of their         existence for those who follow them; as Crawford says &quot;the desire         to leave your mark is very strong.&quot;<small><sup>15</sup></small> The         sculptures have been more profoundly and obviously influenced by prehistoric,         northern European stone monuments such as Stonehenge, the Dolmens, and         the Stone Circles of Carnac. Crawford says &quot;the megaliths are for         me a poetic tool for understanding the world and man's self-appointed         centrality in that order, and the fractal structures are a less egocentric         form for that same understanding. We are each the center of a universe         and at the same time peripheral participants in immense patterns.&quot;<small><sup>16</sup></small>         He says he &quot;wants you to see these expressions as humanity trying         to place itself, trying to derive meaning from all this.&quot;<small><sup>17</sup></small></font>       <p> <font class="second">Crawford wants <i>Queens College Marker</i> to         be appreciated for the sculptural experience it provides as well as for         the spiritual, philosophical meanings it contains, meanings which originated         in his oeuvre in the earlier Markers. He has described the sculpture at         Queens College as &quot;a visual poem&quot; that &quot;holds the space&quot;         of the plaza.<small><sup>18</sup></small> However, in his proposal for         the project, the sculptor clearly intended a more symbolic meaning as         well. He writes that the three segments and their transition from rough-forged         to smooth-forged &quot;are a metaphor for a journey, be it life, education,         enlightenment. The tower is also a marker, a cairn on a mountain path,         a symbol of a man's accomplishments--his attempts to define himself and         place himself and leave evidence thereof for those who follow.&quot; <small><sup>19</sup></small>         The shift from rough-hewn to smooth-contoured clearly symbolizes transformation         and transition. It is possible to think of this as a shift toward more         advanced technology and increased industrialization, and thus the work         can become a metaphor for a broad theme in world history. Located on a         college campus, between the library and the building that houses most         of the social sciences departments, this symbolism acquires certain other         connotations. A shift toward greater refinement alludes to learning, to         sharpening or &quot;refining&quot; one's mind, to acquiring greater knowledge         and understanding. Crawford would not deny these meanings, but he would         discourage the viewer from ever dwelling on them because he thinks that         to emphasize any singular, literal meaning diminishes the aesthetic experience         of the sculpture. The great virtue of <i>Queens College Marker</i> is         that various meanings, aesthetic as well as thematic, are completely unified         and delicately balanced in powerful abstract form. </font>       <p> <font class="second">A mammoth form of rusting steel as public art would         automatically bring to mind Richard Serra's <i>Tilted Arc</i>. Crawford         acknowledges that he and Serra use similar materials, but insists that         he is dealing with a different set of ideas. How will Crawford's work         be received and understood, in the aftermath of this infamous controversy         of public art? To date no objections have apparently been voiced, and         with good reason, for Crawford's work offers a strong argument for a pleasurable,         engaging aesthetic experience made possible by rusting metal. Unlike <i>Tilted         Arc</i>, this sculpture has been placed in an area of this walkway that         would not receive pedestrian traffic and because of its narrow width it         does not obstruct the view of surrounding buildings. It is placed to the         side of the pedestrian pathway; it cannot be ignored yet it does not impede         activity and movement.</font>       <p> <font class="second">The sculptor has said that &quot;hopefully people         will see something in this [<i>Queens College Marker</i>] that gives them         a sense of beauty and order.&quot; <small><sup>20</sup></small> Such meanings         are also fundamental to the prehistoric monuments so important to Crawford's         thinking. <i>Stonehenge</i>, for instance, may have been a clock, and         thus it was a tool--keeping in mind tools are also of interest to Crawford--for         understanding time. Crawford's <i>Markers</i> are meditative forms, and         the <i>Queens College Marker</i> is especially so. Moreover, it is solemn,         poignant, and even somewhat melancholy. This quality originates in the         deliberately rusting surface, which metaphorically alludes to the passage         of time and the fading of all things into nothingness that is a function         of time. Since the <i>Markers</i> are deliberate attempts to make known         the existence of the generic someone or something at any one time or place,         then the <i>Marker</i> at Queens College fully embraces the function of         commemoration that all monuments since the dawn of civilization have been         expected to perform. However, the metaphoric implications of the rusting         surface indicate that monuments and markers are caught in a battle they         can never win; they try to preserve that which is unpreservable and to         make eternal that which is transitory. According to Crawford, the rusting         alludes to humanity's &quot;way of falling apart.&quot; <small><sup>21</sup></small>         Thus a tone of melancholy persists, and such melancholy is foreign to         public monuments, since it self-destroys the purpose for which the monuments         were originally created. However, the work is not entirely pessimistic         in meaning, for through its very presence in the plaza, <i>Queens College         Marker</i> fights to preserve the possibility of commemoration, to reject         the disappearance of all things in time. Crawford has said that &quot;hopefully,         this will be a focal point, a marker that will help recall monuments.&quot;<small><sup>22</sup></small>         The sculpture reminds us that ultimately all monuments are markers in         purpose and spirit. Since it purifies and embodies the concept of commemoration         that is fundamental to monuments as a human endeavor of prehistoric origin,         <i>Queens College Marker</i> is a monument's monument, for it monumentalizes         the commemorative and it commemorates the monumental.</font>       <p><font class="second"><b>References:</b></font>       <p><font class="second">1.
