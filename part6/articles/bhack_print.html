Aberrations from the acceptable         generally emerge to an onslaught of criticism and contempt from those         doomed souls tangled in the quagmire of traditional practice; for these         casualties of artistic revolution, the retreat into the darkened depths         of history is a slow and bitter one. Critics of the Post-Impressionists         and their Modernist progeny were particularly cantankerous during their         descent, desperately holding fast to conventional modes of representation.         For many American artists, such as F.W. Ruckstull and Lorado Taft, Modernism         was a sure sign of human artistic and psychological decay, an apocalypse         first presaged by the arrival of the Aesthetic Movement.<small><sup>1</sup></small>         The art of the Gilded Age, replete with marble and mural reminders of         civic responsibility, was in many ways a response to the hedonistic, Epicurean         philosophy of the Aesthetic Movement as first propagated by Oscar Wilde         during his lecture tour across America in 1882.</font></p>      <p><small><font class="second">Conservative American critics, vehemently         stolid in the stagnant grandeur of classical historicism, bemoaned the         apparent downward spiral into decadence well into the twentieth century.         They interpreted the Modernist fragmentation of space and the defilement         of the human form as the products of a degenerate, feeble-minded temperament;         such radical, <i>imported</i> notions of modernity, they argued, were         as detrimental to the nation's mental and physical purity as the influx         of (and miscegenation with) immigrant populations. As F.W. Ruckstull proclaimed         in 1917, &quot;If we hope to preserve our democracy and help it along         towards a higher perfection and prevent ourselves from sliding backwards         towards slavery, we must above all be loyal to the laws and truths of         nature.&quot;<sup>2</sup> It is no coincidence that the rise of Modernism         coincided with both the rises in popularity of eugenics-the misapplication         of Charles Darwin's principle of natural selection to human cultures-and         of an art that expressed its tenets of biological and psychological perfection.         </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">Developed in 1883 by Charles Darwin's cousin,         Francis Galton (1822 -1911), eugenics merged the science of heredity with         the somewhat misguided interpretation of Darwinian evolution as "survival         of the fittest" (a phrase coined by Herbert Spencer, not Darwin). Eugenic         proposals included extensive genealogical background checks before marriage         in order to increase the likelihood of having perfect children (<i>positive</i>         eugenics) and the sterilization or elimination of those deemed unfit for         human procreation (<i>negative</i> eugenics).<sup>3</sup> The 'Science'         of eugenics soon permeated American biology and hygiene textbooks, marriage         manuals, and silent films such as <i>The Black Stork</i> (1916)<sup>4</sup>         which advocated euthanasia for unfit newborns. Among its many adamant         adherents were John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman, Alexander Graham Bell,         J.H. Kellogg, Margaret Sanger, Theodore Roosevelt, and university presidents         such as Charles W. Eliot (Harvard) and David Starr Jordan (Stanford).         With its moral and patriotic imperative to create the finest and fittest         nation possible, eugenics seemed tailor-made for the American notion of         a progressive society fulfilling the promise of manifest destiny. </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">A number of influential societies were established         in America to promote eugenic ideals: <i>The Race Betterment Foundation</i>,         led by J.H. Kellogg; <i>The American Breeders Association</i>, an organization         devoted to successful animal husbandry that turned its attention to human         livestock in 1906; <i>The Galton Society</i>; and <i>The American Eugenics         Society</i>. In addition, the Carnegie-funded <i>Station for Experimental         Evolution</i> (1904) and the <i>Eugenics Record Office</i> (1910) were         created at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, directed by famed eugenicist         Charles B. Davenport. Several International Congresses of Eugenics were         held, with devastating ultimate results: laws permitting the sterilization         for criminals and the developmentally disadvantaged, often performed without         their consent, were put into effect in several states. Such measures were         supported by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who famously maintained &quot;It         is better for all the world if instead of waiting to execute degenerate         offspring for crime, or let them starve for their imbecility, society         can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.&quot;<sup>5</sup>         Families proving themselves genetically pure would vie for glory and <a href="http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/id3.html" target="_blank">medals</a>         in &quot;Fittest Family&quot; contests in county fairs across the nation.         </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">The expression of eugenics in sculpture,         if addressed at all, has been generally relegated to the idealized depictions         (largely despised/ignored by art historians) of Aryan nationalism during         the Third Reich.<sup>6</sup> American figurative sculpture, equally infused         with idealized forms embodying human perfection, is typically perceived         as <i>classical</i> or as <i>Beaux-Arts-inspired</i> rather than as emblematic         of current biological thought. Representational sculpture in the age of         Modernism was, however, not merely a carryover from the century past,         but an active response-albeit one of desperation-to what was perceived         as the degradation of form. Its advocates-convinced that the cubist and         futurist butchers were mentally and morally degenerate-worked in silent         collusion with the promoters of eugenics. </font></small></p>      <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="bhack_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="hac1cont.jpg" width="210" height="125" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="bhack_1.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               Race Betterment Exhibit, Panama-Pacific International Exposition,               San Francisco, 1915. <br>              From: Frank Morton Todd, The Story of the Exposition (New York:               G.P.

Two of America's foremost sculptors, Karl Bitter and Alexander         Stirling Calder, served as Chief and Acting Chief, respectively, of Sculpture         for the exposition; Bitter directed the completion of models by New York         sculptors on the East Coast, while Calder supervised their enlargement         in staff (a mixture of fiber and plaster) in San Francisco.<sup>11</sup>         Tragically, Bitter was struck and killed by an automobile in April of         1915-two months after the exposition opened-and never was able to witness         the full expression of his vision. </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">Thematically centered around &quot;the Spirit         and Romance of Man's Development, Energy, Adventure, Aspirations and Achievements&quot;,         the exposition intended to explore &quot;[Man's] relation to the Cosmos,         to Nature, and to the Divine.&quot;<sup>12</sup> The very plan of the         exposition, featuring large open courtyards entitled <a href="http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/id6.html" target="_blank">The         Court of the Universe</a> (McKim, Mead and White), <a href="http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/id5.html" target="_blank">The         Court of Ages</a>(Louis Christian Mullgardt), and <a href="http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/id7.html" target="_blank">The         Court of the Four Seasons </a>(Henry Bacon), suggested a harmony with         natural forces.

Separating the panels         were four massive hermes representing milestones of the ages. The Southern-most         panel depicted the consequences of 'physical parenthood without enlightenment'<sup>16</sup>;         marriage books such as <i>The Eugenic Family</i> (1914) warned of such         lustful dangers, pleading for restraint in the face of breeding with degenerates.         In the second panel [facing West] Man has attained intellect, rejecting         these baser instincts.

Health-conscious,         sun-worshipping California became a hotbed of eugenics discussion, due         in part to the works of Jordan and London. The state also led the nation         in enforced sterilizations; some ten thousand criminals and mentally challenged         individuals were sterilized in California between 1909 and 1945.<sup>18</sup>         <i>Fountain of the Earth</i>, with its ever-churning globe whirled along         by the hands of Time and Destiny, represents the eugenic hope for a biological         utopia. </font></small></p>      <table width="104" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="bhack_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="hac4cont.jpg" width="137" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="bhack_4.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               Charles Grafly, <i>Pioneer Mother Monument</i>.

Representing the strong-willed American spirit, Grafly's matriarch         sternly offers her naturally eugenic offspring-nude in their Nordic splendor-to         the future. During this period, researchers at the Eugenics Records Office         were scouring the country in search of genealogical accounts of American         families, in hopes of rooting out the degenerate genetic strands; <i>Pioneer         Mother</i> stands as a testament to a culture consumed with genetic pedigree.         &quot;In eugenics,&quot; remarked W. Grant Hague, &quot;the women of the         race have the instrument wherewith to save the world·the supreme civilizing         instrument of the future.&quot;<sup>20</sup> As it was believed that a         mother's thoughts during pregnancy influenced the physical and mental         health (or lack thereof) of her baby, eugenicists often cited the importance         of women in creating a pure, eugenic race.<sup>21</sup> Depictions of         happy, healthy babies were plentiful at the exposition; among the many         sculptural examples of innocent, playful nude children included Edith         Woodman Burroughs' <i>Fountain of Youth</i>; Edward Berge's <i>Wildflower</i>;         Bela Lyon Pratt's <i>Boy with a Fish</i>; Janet Scudder's <i>Young Diana,         Young Pan</i>, and <i>Fountain of the Fighting Boys</i>; and Edith Barretto         Parsons' <i>The Duck Baby</i>.<sup>22</sup> </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">The interest in Nordic children, fitness,         health, and sun-worship, while certainly characteristic of the eugenics         movement, also posits these works in alliance with symbolist artists such         as P.S. Kr&oslash;yer and L&eacute;on Fr&eacute;deric, as well as with         Scandinavian authors such as Knut Hansun and Henrik Ibsen (although like         the work of Edvard Munch, Ibsen's genetically-cursed characters seem arguments         for eugenics rather than displays of its glorious results). The theme         of biological inheritance loomed large in the art and literature of the         Nordic countries, all of which practiced enforced sterilization-a fact         which, unsurprisingly, American eugenicists applauded. While immigrants         from Eastern Europe were believed to be the cause of racial degeneracy         in this country (the theme of Madison Grant's <i>The Passing of the Great         Race</i>), new arrivals from Norway and Germany received a welcome as         hearty as their homogeneous stock.<sup>23</sup> </font></small></p>      <table width="200" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="bhack_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="hac5cont.jpg" width="215" height="139" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="bhack_5.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               Evelyn Beatrice Longman, <i>Fountain of Ceres</i>.

Offering her &quot;crown of summer to the world&quot;<sup>24</sup>,         Ceres brandishes a scepter fashioned from a corn stalk. While congruous         with the Court's seasonal theme, the fountain coincides with the changing         breakfast fare for American families. In the ten years prior to the exposition,         cereal-largely due to Corn Flakes, the invention of eugenicist J.H. Kellogg         and his brother W.K.-replaced meat and other cooked foods as the morning         meal.<sup>25</sup> As the goddess of abundance and the namesake of cereal,         <i>Ceres</i> reflects the reinvigoration of humankind through proper digestion.<sup>26</sup>         Similarly, the science of Sanitary Chemistry (Home Economics) arose during         this period, championed by the <i>euthenics</i> ('science of controlled         environment') of Ellen Henrietta Richards, who believed that cleanliness         and the healthful preparation of food would improve the fitness of human         stock (it is also at this period that <i>the Boy Scouts of America</i>         is founded, an organization which also promoted health and moral behavior         as a means to achieving a better society). </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">While Modernism was well represented <i>within</i>         the Palace of Fine Arts, the sculptors who decorated the Panama-Pacific         International Exposition appealed to contemporary sensibilities through         their subtle incorporation of evolutionary and eugenic principles; Calder         and Bitter's program seemed a Counter-Reformation in miniature, a rebellion         against the apparent thoughtlessness of the Modern with an onslaught of         contemporary progressive philosophy. Eugenics served as the conservative         answer to immigration, philanthropy, poverty, and Modernism; all social         ills-including Modern Art-could be eradicated genetically. Although eugenics         lost its credibility with most scientists during the 1920s, the pseudo-science         retained public interest until the Second World War, when the horrifying         consequences of national eugenics became brutally apparent. </font></small></p>      <p><small><font class="second">The triumph of Abstraction, a victory which         seems so inevitable and righteous in hindsight, has watered down the vitriol         which deluged its historical moment; decades before <i>Entartete Kunst</i>,         respected American thinkers were labeling Modern Art &quot;the expression         of mental dyspepsia and physical impotence.&quot;<sup>27</sup> A reassessment         of the concept of Modernism in terms of the eugenic response of American         artists and critics, one which keeps in mind the fact that James Earle         Fraser, Sherry Fry, Edith Woodman Burroughs, Chester Beach, and Robert         I. Aitken shared space with the Post-Impressionists and Cubists in the         1913 Armory Show (as well as in the galleries of the Panama-Pacific Exposition),         is long overdue. To imply that the <i>Modern</i> was a universal experience         by limiting its definition to <i>Abstraction</i> is to sterilize-if not         eliminate-untold layers of historical truth. </font></small></p>      <small><font class="second">Additional images for this article are available       at:</font></small><br>      <font class="second"><a href="http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/index.html" target="_blank">http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/index.html</a></font>       <p>&nbsp; </p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>      <p><font class="second"><b>References:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">1.

Both Ruckstull and Taft viewed Auguste         Rodin as the primary force behind the degeneration of Art; while Ruckstull         believed the French sculptor to be mentally deranged, and provided an         appendix written by a physician to prove it, Taft's text features a doctored         illustration of Rodin's <i>Man with the Broken Nose</i> that appears as         if the sculpture is leeringly ogling a bust (also by Rodin) of a Young         Girl (Figures 1, 2).
