Murray's groundbreaking illustration of               negative stereotype in visual art was an intellectual argument for               black self-determination. Pan-African art criticism gained mass               appeal during the Harlem Renaissance with the publishing of <i>The               New Negro</i> (1925), by philosopher Alain Locke. In his book, he               prescribed the reclamation of African culture for growing numbers               of professional African American artists. Both Murray's and Locke's               theories were closely associated with W.E.B. Du Bois' promotion               of positive images of blacks. From their two perspectives Fuller's               <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was deemed the visual epitome of the &quot;Talented               Tenth&quot; movement. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Mary Schmidt Campbell attributes the influence               for <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> to Du Boisian philosophy, which &quot;emphasized               the Black Americans' common African heritage.&quot; Current scholarship               by Richard Powell cites Judith Wilson's claim that the &quot;utopian,               Pan Africanist novel&quot; <i>Ethiopia Unbound</i> (1911) by west               African activist lawyer, J.E. Casely Hayford as Fuller's source               of inspiration. In response, I strongly suggest that <i>Ethopia               Awakening</i> was not the epitome of Du Boisian philosophy or any               other Mr. Hayford's semi-autobiographical novel. Rather, it was               the manifestation of Fuller's own Pan-Africanist feminism recognizing               her collaboration with Garveyite feminist Adelaide Casely Hayford               (J.E. Hayford's ex-wife) in 1920 to build an all girls school in               Sierra Leone. </font></p>            <table width="104" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="swilli_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="wil1cont.jpg" width="109" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="swilli_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Portrait of Meta Warwick Fuller from Bridgewater College's</font></a><font class="sixth">					<a href="http://www.bridgew.edu/HOBA/fuller.htm" target="_blank">Hall of Black Achievement</a></font></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">It makes sense that the initial inspiration               for <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was Fuller's understanding of Murray's               call for an interventionist avant-garde. Fuller proposed to make               her own version of an Africa figure after critically reading his               manuscript, around 1915. <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was a response               to the pleas of the intelligentsia that proclaimed the spiritual               and political relevance of Africa for African Americans. The sculpture               also reiterated, for the entire black world, the elation and pride               that the widely publicized Ethiopian victory over Italian colonial               powers during the era. Murray's arguments, including supportive               visual material, revealed that Daniel Chester French, and many other               sculptors before him, created illusory and undesirable images to               bear on black people. However, the discussion of feminism in this               paper isolates three female statues of &quot;Africa&quot; to juxtapose               another viable process in <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>, which is supported               by contemporary Post-Colonial gender studies in art history. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Murray examined a number of sculpted female               figures known as &quot;Africa.&quot; during the American Renaissance               (1865-1917), a period of Neo-classical revival in art. &quot;Africa&quot;               figures were created specifically as tributes to the Emancipation               Proclamation following the Civil War (1861-1864). These markers               of freedom testified to the libertarian spirit of the founding fathers.               At the same time that they celebrated a vision of independence,               the figures represented Western paternalism and empire by illustrating               Africa as naturally submissive, yielding, and uncultivated. </font></p>            <p><font class="second"><i>Ethopia Awakening</i> (1863) by the American               woman sculptor Anne Whitney, was an example of a pre-Emancipation               &quot;Africa&quot; figure in chains. Whitney's, like other Orientalist               paintings and sculptures about Africa, depicted a scantily clad,               idyllic Odalisque in white marble. The glistening, decidedly non-               African looking, &quot;Africa,&quot; awakened from her sleep and               lifted her veil to expose her body from a horizontal position. Whitney               attributed classical beauty and symbolic enlightenment as a positive               statement about the impending freedom of enslaved African Americans.               It is important to note that although Whitney intended the white               marble sculpture to allude to Africa, it was through the visual               language of Greek myths. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Mary Livermore in <i>Our Famous Women</i>               (1883) described Whitney's depiction of a slave as a representation               of abolitionist goals. Livermore stated, she &quot;listened with               fear and wonder to the sound of broken chains and shackles falling               around her.&quot; According to Livermore, Whitney's cause was so               &quot;legible and well-expressed that even the uninstructed in art               throbbed in sympathy with it.&quot; Livermore added that the &quot;recumbent               . colossal&quot; expressed the teeming luxuriance of the tropics               in which she had her birth.&quot; Orientalist tropes were seamlessly               constructed in Livermore' critique. The discussion of freedom for               Africans in America was depicted by a woman upon whom a curiously               seductive gaze was focused onto body and land. A reconfigured desire               for power and possession is transmitted in such pronounced sexual               overtones. The figure's denoted exoticism and eroticism conveyed               the colonial voyeuristic tendencies in art and real life mistreatment               of women in the colonies. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Contrary to Livermore's reading of Whitney's               abolitionist aesthetics, the sculpture blurred the historical fact               of American slavery and of black people. This image did not denounce               slavery. It relied heavily on the subject of non-European slave               holding traditions, such as harems, in which control over blacks               and women were foreign or essential cultural traditions, to circumvent               America's history. Moreover, Whitney's romanticism, with its emphasis               on beauty and pleasure diverted from any re-examination of the horrible               circumstances of slavery or of the remarkable contribution blacks               made to the Industrial Revolution. Interesting to note, Whitney               eventually destroyed the female figure and later carved a monument               for the martyred abolitionist John Brown. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Daniel Chester French's &quot;Africa&quot;               from his New York Customs House grouping of <i>The Four Continents</i>               (1906) repeated the portrayal of the sleeping &quot;Africa.&quot;               In a comparison with the earlier grouping of nude caryatids done               in France, known as <i>Four Continents</i> by the sculptor Jean               Baptiste Carpeaux (1868-74), the American sculptor, French, reiterated               a remarked imperialist view of Africa in America. In Carpeaux's               coterie, &quot;Africa&quot; &quot;Asia&quot; &quot;Europe&quot;               and &quot;the Americas&quot; represented all as equals. All were               nude women; all subjects of colonialism on some level. The four               standing figures, in contrast to delicate female representations,               supported a globe with upswept arms of modeled muscle and sinew.               Carpeaux wanted to patina stain the different skin tones, but ultimately               showed race through details such &quot;America's&quot; feathered               headdress and the broken shackle at &quot;Africa's&quot; ankle.               Carpeaux rejected pictorial nudity, as well as palliated portrayal               of Africans. The face of &quot;Africa&quot; was naturalistically               molded after an intense-looking black woman with broad features               and thick lips. French critic Paul de Saint-Victoire wrote the predictable               insult in La Liberte, June 22, 1872 that the figures were &quot;neither               man, nor woman, all negresses.&quot; </font></p>            <p><font class="second">French's continents are massively carved out               of monumental blocks of marble. &quot;Africa's&quot; weighty form,               with slouched shoulders and drooping countenance, actually inferred               a drunken stupor. Her garment, which fell from one shoulder and               revealed her breast, was an additional disgrace. The side view of               the sculpture showed that &quot;Africa&quot; slept on a sphinx statue               or throne [surely a reference to vanquished leadership]. Figuratively,               French's internationally acclaimed statue made a challenge to ancient               Egyptian craftsmen by diminishing the sphinx, also the most verifiable               proof of African accomplishment and civilization. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Demoralizing &quot;Africa&quot; was more apparent               in French's work for other reasons. As financial district landmarks,               just across from Ellis Island, French's Custom House statues put               &quot;Africa&quot; within the context of an ever-expanding dialogue               on the American empire. Absolute power counted its trophies by erecting               architectural structures to declare their domination. For example,               the four continents reflect the United States control over exclusive               labor forces of resident African Americans and newly-arrived immigrants,               as well as the international, industrial labor projects on the Panama               Canal, in the Philippines, and rubber plantations in Liberia. French's               &quot;Africa&quot; portrayed American opportunity in the land of               the free for barons of industry and wealth that contrasted to racially               prejudicial images of laboring classes. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">The visual statement that French made about               the relationships between white America and non-whites, indigenous               colonials in Africa, Asia, and the Americas were the same statements               that Pan-Africanist scholarship sought to disrupt. Such biased depictions               were in direct contrast to their emergent socio-economic identity.               Freeman Murray critiqued the contemporary tradition in &quot;Africa&quot;               sculpture in his independently published <i>Emancipation and the               Freed in Sculpture</i> (1916) as evidence of repressive culture               in America and Pan-Africanist positions to eradicate visually-expounded               stereotypes of blacks as vulgar, comedic, or intellectually inferior.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Murray wanted this book to set up criteria               for sculptors of public monuments, such as French, which reinforced               racist postures. He wanted them to be held accountable to blacks               for these depictions. In his examination of the wideness and thinness               of mouths and nostrils in numerous sculptures representing blacks,               Murray contested the use of European facial features for Africans.               In <i>Emancipation and the Freed In Sculpture</i>, Murray did not               fully examine the role of American Imperialism, foreign and domestic               policy, as it pertained to people of color and labor. However, he               continuously dismissed the Europeanized or &quot;half-cast&quot;               features of &quot;Africa&quot; as concessions to promote the oppression               and total erasure of black culture. He stated in the preface of               the book: </font></p>            <blockquote><font class="second">I am convinced that, for Black Folk               - in America, at least - this is of paramount importance. Under               the anomalous conditions prevailing in this country, any recognition               of Black Folks in art works are intended for public view, is apt               to be pleasing to us. But it does not follow that ever such recognition               is creditable and helpful; some of them, indeed are just the opposite.If,               however, the discussions and attempted analyses herein, tend to               encourage or to initiate, in other persons, candid statements and               critical analysis in the matters now under consideration, one of               my main purposes will be accomplished .Interpretation-- which includes:               intention, meaning, effect -is of such paramount importance, that               I would not wish to distract attention from it by extensive technical               criticism, even if I felt myself competent to indulge in such criticism.</font></blockquote>            <p><font class="second">At times, he acted as an apologist to escape               the true indignation that these sculptures garnered. He gave French's               &quot;Africa&quot; only a slight punition and probed, instead, for               its redeeming qualities. For example, although &quot;Africa&quot;               in French's Custom House Group is unconscious, Murray translated               that as &quot;but dozing, napping, she sits ready to rouse herself               on slight alarm.&quot; Murray goes further to inscribe some personality,               she is brooding&quot; Humanity who contemplates the devastation               of Africa. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Murray also reprinted a 1906 review of French's               &quot;Africa&quot; that was originally published in the popular               American magazine, <i>The Craftsman</i>. He attacked that review,               in which the sculpture was described as &quot;a young woman, sumptuously               molded, and with features suggestive of an idealized type rather               than the ancient Egyptian.&quot; Although the reviewers words: &quot;young,               sumptuous, and idealized&quot; were obvious compliments to French,               based on his decision to lend European standards of beauty to a               representation of a non-white, Murray attempted to argue against               the erotic value placed on French's &quot;Africa.&quot; He stated:               &quot;Her fallen mantle exposes for our admiration - or admonition               a more than Amazonian form.&quot; This bifurcated analysis refuted               a singular standard of beauty. However, what is obvious to the reader,               at that moment, is that Murray was disinclined to address the relationship               between body, bondage, and power. In the depiction of a &quot;Europeanized&quot;               woman as &quot; Africa&quot; resides a formula that prohibited a               critical reading by a black male. White women were deemed the intellectual               and physical subject/object of the white male only. The same could               not hold true for black men, of any educated class, such as Murray.               Although he sought to expose the repressive social and cultural               milieu, Murray was undermined by the violent racist temperament               of his society. He understood the taboos, even the risks, of addressing               the nudity of a white female, of marble or in flesh, in 1916, even               through scholarship. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Murray knew that his racially based arguments               were political but might not have any basis in art criticism. In               1915, he chose the black woman sculptor Meta Warrick Fuller (1877-1968)               as his critical reader because, since 1907, when she created <i>Negro's               Progress</i>, she was considered a sculptor of Negro types. She               defined an ideal black physiognomy in her <i>Spirit of the Emancipation</i>               (1913), which reflected a mastery of anatomy, as well as clearly               articulated negroid facial features, commonly associated with sub-Saharan               Africans. Thereby, Murray stated that she &quot;documented her evolving               racial consciousness, as well as her expanding artistic talent.&quot;               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Fuller first gained attention from DuBois               in 1900 when, as an art student in Paris, she entertained African               Americans visiting the Paris Exposition She was one of the first               women to attend the Ecole des Beaux Arts, which opened its doors               to women at the very end of the nineteenth-century. Fuller's achievements               were encouraged by an openly feminist, black middle-class society.               Opportunities that were available to black women in her sphere heightened               their financial independence, as well as their abilities to appropriate               white, upper middle-class values. Her father was a master barber               and had a contagious love of art. He analyzed and interpreted paintings               and sculpture on their regular visits to the Pennsylvania Academy               of the Fine Arts. Soon after her post-graduate art training at the               Pennsylvania Museum School for Industrial Arts, her father passed               away. Her mother, who was an expert wig-maker, and her aunt, who               owned prime real estate, insisted that Fuller travel to Paris. The               two women funded her studies there from 1899 - 1902. In 1902, she               first visited Rodin at Meudon and showed him many works and was               greatly inspired. The influence of this controversial sculptor was               certainly felt in her mannerist modeling of a <i>Man Eating Out               His Heart</i> (1905-6) after Stephen Crane's poem, entitled <i>Secret               Sorrow</i>. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Fuller's mature style, after 1906, was motivated               by the social and political realities of her time. As a black artist               in America, segregation barred her from the career she planned in               Paris. After returning home, she made an impact where she could               by depicting historical images of blacks, a subject matter that               evolved from her commissions for Negro exhibitions. The theme of               the black experience is thereby analogous to those in avant- garde               Modernism, which articulated the rise of the peasant class, rather               than interpretations of upper class symbols. Fuller's view of an               iconic black image was distinctly different from Murray's aesthetics.               In her reviews of Murray's overall thesis, Fuller was overwhelmingly               convinced that the &quot;half-caste&quot; model for representations               of blacks by white artists constituted artistic style, which was               justifiable in and of itself. </font></p>            <blockquote><font class="second">You forget that there is artistic               license as well, and just because a person has a sitter before them               they are not duty bound to copy all they see. Art is not copying.               Anyone with a reasonable amount of training can copy but it is for               the artist to take or have what he chooses to discriminate - to               exaggerate here - to suppress there - to reconstruct somewhere else               - anything that will give emphasis to the inner being he wishes               to represent - this is where genius comes in.</font></blockquote>            <p><font class="second">Fuller's values concretized a more thorough               assessment and corrective of the blatant sexism in racialized &quot;Africa&quot;               figures in <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>. Hers was a different approach               from Murray's and other Pan-Africanists' who were clearly still               working with making trophies in their own image, while Fuller was               dealing with more substantive conditions beyond surface aesthetics               - a Pan-African feminism. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Fuller's collaboration with Garveyite Hayford               (1868-1960) allowed both women to actively express their moral convictions               and political platforms. They were encouraged in 1920, the year               before <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was created, and when women's Suffragette               movements finally succeeded in attaining voting rights for women.               In 1919, Fuller created a tribute to a lynched pregnant woman, entitled               <i>Mary Turner: A Silent Protest Against Mob Violence</i>. There               is little doubt that Fuller's Pan-Africanist feminism was strengthened               from her association with Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement               Association. It was a departure from &quot;Talented Tenth&quot;               circles and the bi-partisan politics that Pan-African male leadership,               specifically Marcus Garvey and DuBois, thrived on. Furthermore,               Garvey trained women in areas of industrial/vocational training,               the study of African culture, and leadership roles. The movement               recognized feminists' issues such as, education, moral motherhood               versus career, and women's health and diet, in direct response to               the post-emancipation female condition. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Hayford, also an inspiration, was born into               a colonial bourgeois and racially mixed civil servant family. Like               Fuller's, her early life involved social events at church, school,               and clubs. She rose to presidency of her Freetown women's UNIA in               1919 and then announced her intentions to build an all-girls' school               in Freetown. The curriculum would reintroduce and promote precolonial               values such as communalism into the colonial society. In 1923, Hayford               returned to Freetown, Sierra Leone and later wrote of her vision:               </font></p>            <blockquote><font class="second">In my mind's eye I could see a school               in which girls, instead of blindly copying European fashions, would               be dressed in attractive native garments which would enhance their               personal charms.I could hear the young mothers teaching their sons               the glory of Black citizenship, rather than encouraging them to               bewail the fact that they were not white.I could imagine the artistic               youth of the hereafter painting pictures depicting black faces not               white.I could visualize the listless, lethargic, educated town girl               of today, through the medium of well-equipped gymnasiums and trained               physical cultures enjoying the energy and vitality of her grandmother               who thought nothing of spending days hoeing fields or carrying a               load as weighty as any man's. And then I could picture the sons               and daughters of Africa's race 'looking the whole world in the face'               without any apology whatsoever for the color of their skins, and               with such self-respect as to command the respect of all nations.</font></blockquote>			<p><font class="second">Hayford and Fuller wrote and produced a benefit staging of a Middle             Passage drama, entitled &quot;The Answer&quot; to fundraise for the             school, which was performed at black churches. In the drama, as well             as her own version of <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>, Fuller promoted an             assertion of womanhood and an outpouring of purposeful ambition. In             the sculptor's words, the figure showed the process of &quot;awakening,             gradually unwinding the bandages of [her] past and looking out on             life again, expectant but unafraid.&quot; Fuller's <i>Ethiopia</i>             depicted the stripping away of old garments, as Hayford deemed necessary.             This common denominator illustrated their belief in a proactive and             aesthetic approach for the advancement of black women. Whereas Hayford             refuted the &quot;blindly&quot; copied European fashions for &quot;native             garments,&quot; Fuller's comment to Murray: &quot;art is not copying&quot;             echoed the same sentiment. These women wanted to challenge the status             quo on all grounds; their newly-formed choices would promote positive             self-image. In turn, that liberating image was manifested within black             female spaces such as the black church, and the home, as well as in             the visible outer community. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">In comparison with numerous other &quot;Africa&quot;               figures, <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> may be the only standing figure               that is not a caryatid. It is an intellectual symbol. By clothing               &quot;Africa&quot; the statue differed from the nude spectacles               of the past, reversed the gaze, and alluded to self-contemplation               within the female domain. Moreover, Fuller reconfigured the &quot;Africa&quot;               figures' iconography and inserted her own portrait for the face.               Theatrically posed, the petite woman held her small hand to her               breast. In its refutation of languorous nudity, Fuller's sculpture               did not preclude a doll-like quality analogous to Hayford's remark               on &quot;personal charm.&quot; In fact, the pose originated in so               many fashion figures or mannequins, particularly illustrations in               women's magazines at the time. The small size of the statue, about               five feet tall, was easily received. It seems physically and psychologically               directed at a female audience. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">To further fixate on its feminist message,               I suggest its relevance to Hayford's liberal arts initiative and               its relationship to women's mental and physical health. Around 1919,               corsets were connected to prenatal and gynocentric problems and               lost popularity. A healthier and less constricting, form of undergarment               that looks similar to the wrappings on Fuller's statue replaced               the earlier hourglass version. This was apparently not in contrast               with Hayford's prescribed abandonment of European fashions, and               a return to traditional African standards of beauty and well-being.               Thereby a clearer understanding of how the mummy wrappings of &quot;Ethiopia's&quot;               lower body alluded not to death but to ancestral, spiritual beliefs               in continuous rebirth from which the consciousness of the woman               emerges. </font></p>            <p><font class="second"><i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was divided into               three &quot;spatial tropes&quot; or three registers of the body.               The feet and legs are restricted, not unlike depictions of chained               &quot;Africa&quot; figures and slavery is not a discarded or hanging               metaphor. Ethiopia's clothed torso, in the second register, purposely               resisted any likeness to the seductive captive image. In that, Fuller's               revision addressed the notion of the submissive, feminized black               race and its importance to male fantasies, as Murray never did.               One arm rested at her side while the other hand was placed at the               heart -- caught in a moment of self-reflection. A cerebral awakening               was produced by a heavily-modeled surface and the &quot;quickened               light&quot; it created, in contrast to the figure's tightly, compacted               plasticity. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">The third register, often described as a pharaoh's               crown, conveyed a pyramidal shape over the columnar body through               a simply-draped cloth on the head. The compressed planes of the               face, the head, and the headdress are slightly too large. Fuller's               digressed from the former naturalism in her portrait and anatomical               studies in order to explore Cubist aspects, such as those informed               by African &quot;primitive art,&quot; although no other Cubist elements               exist in the sculptor's oeuvre. Ethiopia's rhythmic lines, angular               curves, and overall geometricity are signs of abstraction which               art historian Judith Wilson viewed as &quot;stylistic cues from               African sources,&quot; merely the usage of &quot;key tropes&quot;               to articulate an African theme, without Cubist aims. Art scholar               Mary Campbell stated strongly that it is &quot;among the earliest               examples of American art to reflect the formal exigencies of an               aesthetics based on African sculpture.&quot; </font></p>            <p><font class="second"><i>Ethiopia</i> actually prefigured Locke's               promotion of African-inspired modernism, which he termed the &quot;African               legacy.&quot; In fact, Locke could have responded to the new plasticity               which Fuller modeled in the head, torso, and lower extremities.               If that is true, her experimentation with African art was inspired               by something more -- it was an aesthetic derived from her activist               affiliation with Hayford's efforts to educate black women. As the               eye follows the tilted head down the edges of the headdress, the               expressive hand secures the drapery at her bosom. <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>               conveys a taking of vows and a noble commitment that I suggest was               a dialogue with other women. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Ethiopia's raised countenance connotes determination.               Fuller's philosophical statement in <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was               not inspired by Du Boisian Pan-Africanism or by the espousal of               Locke's theories of the ancestral modernism. Fuller's conception               of Africa bloomed during the time she participated with Hayford               in the feminist vision to educate African women. In this way, the               work reflected major changes in the self-conception of women who               designated the rise of black female agency during the early twentieth               century.</font></p>            <p><font class="second"><b>Links</b></font><br></p>            <p><font class="second">Meta Warrick Fuller - <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/docsouth/brawley/brawley.html" target="_blank">http://metalab.unc.edu/docsouth/brawley/brawley.html</a><br>              [lovely photo portrait of Fuller from Benjamin Brawley's Women of               Achievement].</font></p>             <p><font class="second"><i>Ethopia Awakening</i> [Fuller] - <a href="http://www.csupomona.edu/~plin/women2/fuller.html" target="_blank">               http://www.csupomona.edu/~plin/women2/fuller.html</a> <br>              [small photographic image of the statue].</font><font class="second">               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Negro's Progress - <a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu" target="_blank">			http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu</a></font></p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="swilli_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font>             </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Stacey Williams.
