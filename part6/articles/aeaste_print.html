While most of the women active at this time received only         the briefest critical attention, a small number stood out as major artistic         figures: Marguerite Dubois d'Avesnes, among the first to address the lacuna         of sculpture instruction for women, taught several students including         Charlotte Besnard, who in turn debuted in 1869 and went on to launch a         successful career during the Third Republic. The widowed Marie Lef&egrave;vre-Deumier         was able to work her way into the imperial household to become an unofficial         portraitist, somewhat akin to the role also played for a time by the more         widely recognized Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.<small><sup>2</sup></small> More         prominent still were No&eacute;mie Constant, known as &quot;Claude Vignon,&quot;         and the celebrated Duchesse de Castiglione Colonna, who exhibited under         the name &quot;Marcello.&quot; Almost completely unknown today, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne         Bertaux seems to have enjoyed the greatest professional standing of her         female colleagues during the 19th-century (fig. 1). Launching her career         in relative obscurity at the beginning of the Second Empire, her initial         success was due not only to her considerable technical competence, but         also to her strategic appeals for support as a woman artist. She particularly         sought out government officials and others with close ties to the imperial         household, whose support represented an important mark of official distinction         that opened the doors to other opportunities.</font></p>      <p> <font class="second">Born in 1825, the daughter of a minor ornamental         sculptor, Bertaux began working in her father's studio at the age of fifteen.         Her formative training, first under her father, and later with Augustin         Dumont, provided her with a technical competence and competitive edge         unusual for a woman at that time.<small><sup>3</sup></small> Conforming         to a conservative (academic) ideal, her work appealed to a wide market         of both public and private patrons. She enjoyed an extensive exhibition         record including several awards, such as a gold medal from the 1889 Universal         Exposition, and the <i>hors concours</i> designation (meaning that her         work was not subject to jury approval for the annual Salon exhibitions).         Her name figured prominently in the press, including numerous exhibition         reviews in well-circulating journals such as the Gazette des Beaux-Arts,         and L'Art Fran&ccedil;ais. In addition to her professional pursuits as         an artist, Bertaux instituted the Union of Women Painters, Sculptors and         Engravers in 1881 to provide both successful and emerging women artists         with a forum in which to expose their work. As president of the Union         for many years, she was also editor of its monthly journal. A vocal champion         of women's professional artistic advancement, she established the first         sculpture school for women, set up several monetary awards for women artists,         and became a dominant force in the crusade to force the Ecole des Beaux-arts         to open its doors to them. Towards the end of her life, after a long campaign         to get women onto the salon jury, she was finally elected in 1896 as the         first (and only) woman to serve until her death in 1910.</font>       <p> <font class="second">Well aware of the path towards success as she began         her professional life, Bertaux sought access to elite patronage through         numerous letters of solicitation. A particular series of letters from         her requesting the state purchase of an early relief of <i>The Assumption         of the Virgin</i>, offers insight into her strategies. Going directly         to the top, she addressed herself to the Superintendent of Fine Arts Emilien         de Nieuwerkerke, to the Emperor Napoleon III, and perhaps also to his         cousin the Princess Mathilde. Perceptive and persistent, she gauged her         audience and submitted her request accordingly. Appealing to empathy,         paternalism and discernment, in each case she called attention to her         unusual position as a woman facing the difficulties of succeeding in a         male dominated profession. While it took years from her first letter in         1859 to the eventual purchase of the relief in 1868, in the meantime,         she became well-known within the art bureaucracy, receiving other lucrative         commissions that helped to launch and eventually sustain her career.</font></p>      <table width="113" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="aeaste_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="eas4cont.jpg" width="113" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"> <a href="aeaste_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>The               Assumption of the Virgin</i>, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux, 1863,               plaster, 2.3 x 1.2 meters.

For the latter, the state paid 6,000 francs, a very         generous sum for such a small-scale sculpture.<small><sup>4</sup></small>         Both pieces ended up in the church at Saint Gratien, near the summer ch‰teau         of the Emperor's cousin, the Princess Mathilde.</font>       <p> <font class="second">While the Emperor shied away from direct involvement         in the arts administration, his cousin Mathilde, an artist herself, seems         to have played an indirect but powerful role. Following her separation         from an abusive husband, she befriended Count Emilien de Nieuwerkerke         and made him into her prot&eacute;g&eacute;. In a position to further         his career, she pressed for his appointment as Director-General of Museums         in 1849, and used her influence to secure his subsequent promotions and         awards, including his election into the Academy of Fine Arts, his induction         into the Legion of Honor, and his appointment in 1863 as Superintendent         of Fine Arts, a post especially created for him by the Emperor.<small><sup>5</sup></small>         It is likely that Bertaux knew of Mathilde's connection to the Superintendent,         and tried to ingratiate herself to both. While it is impossible to determine         who became her greatest ally, both seemed favorably disposed towards encouraging         women artists in general, and it was during Nieuwerkerke's tenure that         the state eventually purchased the <i>Assumption</i>.</font></p>      <table width="102" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="aeaste_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="eas1cont.jpg" width="102" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="aeaste_3.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               <i>For the Poor!</i>, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux, 1861, bronze,               dimensions unknown.

This         anonymous person to whom Bertaux had addressed her request would almost         certainly have been Mathilde, since no other woman at the time held any         substantial influence over the art bureaucracy. Lacking as it was in extreme         formality, the letter probably could not have been intended for the Empress,         who was also supportive of women artists, but usually remained fairly         removed from administrative matters.</font>       <p> <font class="second">Encouraged by the acquisitions for Saint Gratien,         Bertaux had sent a second appeal earlier in 1861 to the Minister of State         to purchase her relief. Despite the fact that her request was accompanied         by signatures of support from several government deputies, she received         no response. Following this rebuff she wrote her letter to the unnamed         woman:</font>       <blockquote><font class="second">Madame, encouraged by those familiar with         the nobility of your character, I dare, for the first time in my life,         address myself to one so distinguished, in order to speak the language         of an artist hardly established in the world.</font>         <p> <font class="second">For several years my name has figured in the           sculpture section in the guide to the salon, where I had the honor at           the last exhibition to see my work purchased by His Majesty the Emperor.           Encouraged&#133;I then worked on an Assumption&#133;[T]he work, seen           in my atelier by distinguished individuals, was judged by them worthy           of acquisition for the church of Bessuire&#133;[T]his request, signed           by the most eminent names was addressed six months ago to the Minister           of State. What has become of it I do not know. It was then Madame, that           the thought came to me to summon your benevolent regard to me. See me           as a woman, a wife and mother&#133;who wants to triumph in her position&#133;</font>         <p> <font class="second">If you deign, Madame, to turn your eyes towards           me, to personally order a report from one of the inspectors regarding           the merit of the work, if the report is favorable, and finally, by happy           chance, [if] a work in marble or in stone would be entrusted to me by           his excellence the Minister, I would owe you all my [illegible word]           Madame, and fulfilled in my lofty obligations, I will acquire a name           among the great religious sculptors-a place quite difficult to attain,           a woman's normal hardship making very difficult the lasting fears, the           long months, during which a free arm must take up the chisel in order           to produce a work&#133;</font>         <p> <font class="second">If I dared to finish here with a request, I would           entreat you, Madame, to consent to grant me the favor of an audience           in which I could properly tell you how much I am glad as a woman that           I was spared from making my request to these gentlemen whom I no longer           know.<small><sup>6</sup></small></font>       </blockquote>      <font class="second">Whether or not Bertaux was able to have an audience       with Mathilde (or to whomever the letter was intended) is impossible to       say. That the letter was forwarded to the proper bureaucrats indicates that       someone had at least taken an interest in her situation &quot;as a woman,       wife, and mother&quot; whose &quot;normal hardships&quot; made success elusive.       In any case, despite Bertaux's bold attempt, the state did not immediately       acquire her <i>Assumption</i>. For that it took several more years and several       more letters, to the Emperor, (though it was undoubtedly intercepted by       the art administration before it ever reached his eyes), and later to Nieuwerkerke.       Like her initial letter to the Minister of State, these had signed endorsements       from deputies and other officials scribbled along the margins. The relief       had already been exhibited, receiving an honorable mention in 1863, and       Bertaux had since received medals for other work. Enumerating these proven       qualifications in her 1867 letter of solicitation to Napoleon III, she asked       him for a commission in bronze:</font>       <blockquote><font class="second">Madame L&eacute;on Bertaux, statuaire,         begs your Majesty to kindly grant the favor of a purchase of a large bas         relief, in a unique bronze version &#133; representing the Assumption         of the Virgin &#133;[T]he qualifications that she dares to put forward         in order to appeal to the kindness of your Majesty, are: the difficulties         that she met, as a woman, to share in official commissions; her exhibitions,         uninterrupted for ten years; and two medals that were awarded to her by         the jury for the salons of 1864 and 1867.</font>         <p> <font class="second">She begs your Majesty to kindly grant a favorable           regard to this request, to encourage her future, the whole of which           is destined to that of a sculptor.</font>         <p> <font class="second">She has the honor to be, with the most profound           respect to your Majesty, your very humble and loyal subject.<small><sup>7</sup></small></font>       </blockquote>      <table width="110" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="aeaste_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="eas2cont.jpg" width="110" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"> <a href="aeaste_4.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>Young               Gaul</i>, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux, 1867, marble, height 1.6               meters.

To Nieuwerkerke then-with whom she       had already had dealings through other government acquisitions of her work-she       made flattering appeals to his chivalry and artistic discernment:</font>       <blockquote>         <p><font class="second">[Y]ou are, sir, my natural protector. It is therefore           to you alone in this circumstance that I once again place my destiny.</font>         </p>        <p><font class="second">The Emperor has dedicated his life to the improvement           of the working class; you have dedicated yours to the happiness and           prosperity of the arts and the artists the most deserving due to their           talent&#133;</font> </p>        <p> <font class="second">&#133;[I] am a woman, and because of that reason           official commissions are lacking despite two medals. For ten years there           have only been the acquisitions which I owe to your goodness; the two           groups for Saint-Gratien and the young Gaul. I would like to pay my           debt of gratitude through merit, and thus I must work very hard, and           our [type of] work is expensive.<small><sup>8</sup></small></font>       </blockquote>      <p><font class="second">In 1868 Bertaux's relief was finally acquired for         4,000 francs and soon followed by other commissions. Considering her substantial         professional success even before the purchase of her relief, it seems         strange that she would have pressed her case so adamantly. In addition         to the several official acquisitions and her Tuileries commission, she         had also received a commission in 1865 from the city of Paris for statues         of <i>Saint Philip</i> and <i>Saint Mathew</i> for the church of St. Laurent,         as well as one in 1868 for a pediment relief of <i>The Pascal Lamb</i>         for the entrance of the church of St. Francis Xavior. However, Bertaux         was neither independently wealthy nor a dilettante. Working without outside         resources, she was trying to secure an income that would allow her to         maintain a large workshop as well as support an upper-bourgeois way of         life. She did not want the odd handouts or awards given to minor sculptors,         but rather the steady and major commissions necessary to sustain a serious         professional career. These were difficult to come by, as Bertaux pointed         out, especially for a woman for whom patronage was seen more as a favor         than as her due.</font></p>                  <p><font class="second"><b>References:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">1.
