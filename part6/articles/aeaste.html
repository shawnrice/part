In his <i>Dictionnaire des Sculpteurs de l'Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise               au XIXe Si&egrave;cle</i> (1914-1921), Stanislas Lami included at               least thirteen women whose careers either encompassed or began sometime               during the Second Empire.<small><sup>1</sup></small> More still               appeared in salon guides and reviews. While most of the women active               at this time received only the briefest critical attention, a small               number stood out as major artistic figures: Marguerite Dubois d'Avesnes,               among the first to address the lacuna of sculpture instruction for               women, taught several students including Charlotte Besnard, who               in turn debuted in 1869 and went on to launch a successful career               during the Third Republic. The widowed Marie Lef&egrave;vre-Deumier               was able to work her way into the imperial household to become an               unofficial portraitist, somewhat akin to the role also played for               a time by the more widely recognized Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux.<small><sup>2</sup></small>               More prominent still were No&eacute;mie Constant, known as &quot;Claude               Vignon,&quot; and the celebrated Duchesse de Castiglione Colonna,               who exhibited under the name &quot;Marcello.&quot; Almost completely               unknown today, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux seems to have enjoyed               the greatest professional standing of her female colleagues during               the 19th-century (fig. 1). Launching her career in relative obscurity               at the beginning of the Second Empire, her initial success was due               not only to her considerable technical competence, but also to her               strategic appeals for support as a woman artist. She particularly               sought out government officials and others with close ties to the               imperial household, whose support represented an important mark               of official distinction that opened the doors to other opportunities.</font></P>            <p> <font class="second">Born in 1825, the daughter of a minor ornamental               sculptor, Bertaux began working in her father's studio at the age               of fifteen. Her formative training, first under her father, and               later with Augustin Dumont, provided her with a technical competence               and competitive edge unusual for a woman at that time.<small><sup>3</sup></small>               Conforming to a conservative (academic) ideal, her work appealed               to a wide market of both public and private patrons. She enjoyed               an extensive exhibition record including several awards, such as               a gold medal from the 1889 Universal Exposition, and the <i>hors               concours</i> designation (meaning that her work was not subject               to jury approval for the annual Salon exhibitions). Her name figured               prominently in the press, including numerous exhibition reviews               in well-circulating journals such as the Gazette des Beaux-Arts,               and L'Art Fran&ccedil;ais. In addition to her professional pursuits               as an artist, Bertaux instituted the Union of Women Painters, Sculptors               and Engravers in 1881 to provide both successful and emerging women               artists with a forum in which to expose their work. As president               of the Union for many years, she was also editor of its monthly               journal. A vocal champion of women's professional artistic advancement,               she established the first sculpture school for women, set up several               monetary awards for women artists, and became a dominant force in               the crusade to force the Ecole des Beaux-arts to open its doors               to them. Towards the end of her life, after a long campaign to get               women onto the salon jury, she was finally elected in 1896 as the               first (and only) woman to serve until her death in 1910.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Well aware of the path towards success as               she began her professional life, Bertaux sought access to elite               patronage through numerous letters of solicitation. A particular               series of letters from her requesting the state purchase of an early               relief of <i>The Assumption of the Virgin</i>, offers insight into               her strategies. Going directly to the top, she addressed herself               to the Superintendent of Fine Arts Emilien de Nieuwerkerke, to the               Emperor Napoleon III, and perhaps also to his cousin the Princess               Mathilde. Perceptive and persistent, she gauged her audience and               submitted her request accordingly. Appealing to empathy, paternalism               and discernment, in each case she called attention to her unusual               position as a woman facing the difficulties of succeeding in a male               dominated profession. While it took years from her first letter               in 1859 to the eventual purchase of the relief in 1868, in the meantime,               she became well-known within the art bureaucracy, receiving other               lucrative commissions that helped to launch and eventually sustain               her career.</font></p>            <table width="113" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="aeaste_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="eas4cont.jpg" width="113" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"> <a href="aeaste_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>The                     Assumption of the Virgin</i>, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux,                     1863, plaster, 2.3 x 1.2 meters.

Not long after, in 1861, the state made its first purchase               of her work-not the relief, but rather a holy water basin depicting               <i>The Three Theological Virtues</i> in the guise of cherubs, and               an elaborate collection box entitled <i>For the Poor!</i>. For the               latter, the state paid 6,000 francs, a very generous sum for such               a small-scale sculpture.<small><sup>4</sup></small> Both pieces               ended up in the church at Saint Gratien, near the summer château               of the Emperor's cousin, the Princess Mathilde.</font>             <p> <font class="second">While the Emperor shied away from direct               involvement in the arts administration, his cousin Mathilde, an               artist herself, seems to have played an indirect but powerful role.               Following her separation from an abusive husband, she befriended               Count Emilien de Nieuwerkerke and made him into her prot&eacute;g&eacute;.               In a position to further his career, she pressed for his appointment               as Director-General of Museums in 1849, and used her influence to               secure his subsequent promotions and awards, including his election               into the Academy of Fine Arts, his induction into the Legion of               Honor, and his appointment in 1863 as Superintendent of Fine Arts,               a post especially created for him by the Emperor.<small><sup>5</sup></small>               It is likely that Bertaux knew of Mathilde's connection to the Superintendent,               and tried to ingratiate herself to both. While it is impossible               to determine who became her greatest ally, both seemed favorably               disposed towards encouraging women artists in general, and it was               during Nieuwerkerke's tenure that the state eventually purchased               the <i>Assumption</i>.</font></p>            <table width="102" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="aeaste_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="eas1cont.jpg" width="102" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="aeaste_3.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     <i>For the Poor!</i>, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux, 1861,                     bronze, dimensions unknown.

This anonymous person to whom               Bertaux had addressed her request would almost certainly have been               Mathilde, since no other woman at the time held any substantial               influence over the art bureaucracy. Lacking as it was in extreme               formality, the letter probably could not have been intended for               the Empress, who was also supportive of women artists, but usually               remained fairly removed from administrative matters.</font>             <p> <font class="second">Encouraged by the acquisitions for Saint               Gratien, Bertaux had sent a second appeal earlier in 1861 to the               Minister of State to purchase her relief. Despite the fact that               her request was accompanied by signatures of support from several               government deputies, she received no response. Following this rebuff               she wrote her letter to the unnamed woman:</font>             <blockquote><font class="second">Madame, encouraged by those familiar               with the nobility of your character, I dare, for the first time               in my life, address myself to one so distinguished, in order to               speak the language of an artist hardly established in the world.</font>              <p> <font class="second">For several years my name has figured in                 the sculpture section in the guide to the salon, where I had the                 honor at the last exhibition to see my work purchased by His Majesty                 the Emperor. Encouraged&#133;I then worked on an Assumption&#133;[T]he                 work, seen in my atelier by distinguished individuals, was judged                 by them worthy of acquisition for the church of Bessuire&#133;[T]his                 request, signed by the most eminent names was addressed six months                 ago to the Minister of State. What has become of it I do not know.                 It was then Madame, that the thought came to me to summon your                 benevolent regard to me. See me as a woman, a wife and mother&#133;who                 wants to triumph in her position&#133;</font>              <p> <font class="second">If you deign, Madame, to turn your eyes                 towards me, to personally order a report from one of the inspectors                 regarding the merit of the work, if the report is favorable, and                 finally, by happy chance, [if] a work in marble or in stone would                 be entrusted to me by his excellence the Minister, I would owe                 you all my [illegible word] Madame, and fulfilled in my lofty                 obligations, I will acquire a name among the great religious sculptors-a                 place quite difficult to attain, a woman's normal hardship making                 very difficult the lasting fears, the long months, during which                 a free arm must take up the chisel in order to produce a work&#133;</font>              <p> <font class="second">If I dared to finish here with a request,                 I would entreat you, Madame, to consent to grant me the favor                 of an audience in which I could properly tell you how much I am                 glad as a woman that I was spared from making my request to these                 gentlemen whom I no longer know.<small><sup>6</sup></small></font>            </blockquote>            <font class="second">Whether or not Bertaux was able to have an audience             with Mathilde (or to whomever the letter was intended) is impossible             to say. That the letter was forwarded to the proper bureaucrats indicates             that someone had at least taken an interest in her situation &quot;as             a woman, wife, and mother&quot; whose &quot;normal hardships&quot;             made success elusive. In any case, despite Bertaux's bold attempt,             the state did not immediately acquire her <i>Assumption</i>. For that             it took several more years and several more letters, to the Emperor,             (though it was undoubtedly intercepted by the art administration before             it ever reached his eyes), and later to Nieuwerkerke. Like her initial             letter to the Minister of State, these had signed endorsements from             deputies and other officials scribbled along the margins. The relief             had already been exhibited, receiving an honorable mention in 1863,             and Bertaux had since received medals for other work. Enumerating             these proven qualifications in her 1867 letter of solicitation to             Napoleon III, she asked him for a commission in bronze:</font>             <blockquote><font class="second">Madame L&eacute;on Bertaux, statuaire,               begs your Majesty to kindly grant the favor of a purchase of a large               bas relief, in a unique bronze version &#133; representing the Assumption               of the Virgin &#133;[T]he qualifications that she dares to put forward               in order to appeal to the kindness of your Majesty, are: the difficulties               that she met, as a woman, to share in official commissions; her               exhibitions, uninterrupted for ten years; and two medals that were               awarded to her by the jury for the salons of 1864 and 1867.</font>              <p> <font class="second">She begs your Majesty to kindly grant a                 favorable regard to this request, to encourage her future, the                 whole of which is destined to that of a sculptor.</font>              <p> <font class="second">She has the honor to be, with the most                 profound respect to your Majesty, your very humble and loyal subject.<small><sup>7</sup></small></font>            </blockquote>            <table width="110" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="aeaste_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="eas2cont.jpg" width="110" height="200" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"> <a href="aeaste_4.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth"><i>Young                     Gaul</i>, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux, 1867, marble, height                     1.6 meters. Whereabouts unknown. Photo from Edouard Lepage,                     Une Conqu&ecirc;te F&eacute;ministe: Mme L&eacute;on Bertaux,                     1912.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <font class="second">Receiving no response, she finally wrote to Nieuwerkerke.             Despite her considerable accomplishments Bertaux was in an awkward             situation. A more ambitious statue, <i>Young Gaul</i>, had already             been purchased that year, and she had also received a commission for             an allegorical relief of <i>Navigation</i> to appear as a pediment             on the Tuileries palace, no doubt placing her in a position, to the             eyes of the bureaucrats, as a woman having too recently received too             many favors. To Nieuwerkerke then-with whom she had already had dealings             through other government acquisitions of her work-she made flattering             appeals to his chivalry and artistic discernment:</font>             <blockquote>              <p><font class="second">[Y]ou are, sir, my natural protector. It                 is therefore to you alone in this circumstance that I once again                 place my destiny.</font> </p>              <p><font class="second">The Emperor has dedicated his life to the                 improvement of the working class; you have dedicated yours to                 the happiness and prosperity of the arts and the artists the most                 deserving due to their talent&#133;</font> </p>              <p> <font class="second">&#133;[I] am a woman, and because of that                 reason official commissions are lacking despite two medals. For                 ten years there have only been the acquisitions which I owe to                 your goodness; the two groups for Saint-Gratien and the young                 Gaul. I would like to pay my debt of gratitude through merit,                 and thus I must work very hard, and our [type of] work is expensive.<small><sup>8</sup></small></font>            </blockquote>            <p><font class="second">In 1868 Bertaux's relief was finally acquired               for 4,000 francs and soon followed by other commissions. Considering               her substantial professional success even before the purchase of               her relief, it seems strange that she would have pressed her case               so adamantly. In addition to the several official acquisitions and               her Tuileries commission, she had also received a commission in               1865 from the city of Paris for statues of <i>Saint Philip</i> and               <i>Saint Mathew</i> for the church of St. Laurent, as well as one               in 1868 for a pediment relief of <i>The Pascal Lamb</i> for the               entrance of the church of St. Francis Xavior. However, Bertaux was               neither independently wealthy nor a dilettante. Working without               outside resources, she was trying to secure an income that would               allow her to maintain a large workshop as well as support an upper-bourgeois               way of life. She did not want the odd handouts or awards given to               minor sculptors, but rather the steady and major commissions necessary               to sustain a serious professional career. These were difficult to               come by, as Bertaux pointed out, especially for a woman for whom               patronage was seen more as a favor than as her due.</font></p>            <p><font class="second"><b>Links</b></font></p>            <p><font class="second">For information about women's access to artistic training in               19th-Century France see the Dahesh Museum exhibition site for "Overcoming               All Obstacles: The Women of the Académie Julian" at: http://www.daheshmuseum.org/exhibitions.html.             </font></p>            <p><font class="second">I have not found any sites that mention Bertaux.               However, there are several sources of information on 19th-century               French sculptor Camille Claudel, including a site at: <a href="http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/claudel_camille.html" target="_blank">http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/claudel_camille.html</a>.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">The National Museum of Women in the Arts also               has sites for Claudel and 19th-century French painter/sculptor Rosa               Bonheur at: <a href="http://www.nmwa.org" target="_blank">http://www.nmwa.org</a>.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Other web sites for information on women artists               include the Women Artists Web Resource at: <a href="http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Women/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.artsednet.getty.edu/ArtsEdNet/Resources/Women/index.html</a>               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">the Women Artists Archive at: <a href="http://libweb.sonoma.edu/special/waa/html" target="_blank">http://libweb.sonoma.edu/special/waa/html</a>.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="aeaste_ref.html">References&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="aeaste_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Anastasia Easterday.
