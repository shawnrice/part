The first is Lorenzo Ghiberti's <i>Gates of               Paradise</i> of the baptistery of the Florence Cathedral, completed               in 1452. The second is Giacomo Manz&#249;'s <i>Gates of Death</i>               of St. Peter's in the Vatican, completed in 1963. The gerund &quot;piercing&quot;               within the above title is borrowed from Hubert Damisch's <i>The               Origin of Perspective</i>, in which the author links to a certain               extent the 1490-96 painting of Vittore Carpaccio entitled <i>Recepetion               of Ambassadors</i> to frescoes in Assisi. Referring to the Reception               of the Ambassadors, Damisch reflects: &quot;In this respect it recalls               Giotto's [<i>sic</i>] frescoes in Assisi: the painting 'pierces'               the wall all the more effectively because it concedes its presence,               incorporating mural elements into its own field.&quot;<small><sup>1</sup></small></font></P>            <table width="104" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rsarks_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="sar2cont.jpg" width="115" height="173" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="rsarks_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     <i>Gates of Death</i>, Giacomo Manz&#249;, 1963, leftmost of five doors of the façade of St. Peter's Cathedral, Vatican.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p><font class="second">From such a point of departure, we seem to               witness earlier means of representing three-dimensional and architectural               space pictorially. The frescoes of Assisi recall an earlier use               of perspective, which is evident in other works by Giotto di Bondone<small><sup>2</sup></small>.               The illusion of depth arrives at various standardized and theoretically               established, graphic and pictorial means about a century later.               A number of panels of <i>The Gates of Paradise</i> (Figure 1) depict               three-dimensional space through linear perspective. Yet toward the               middle of the twentieth century we come across significant departures               from these rules within the formal design and implementation of               <i>The Gates of Death</i>. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">The substantive phrase &quot;'piercing' the               flat&quot; can itself be read as being charged with intonations.               It is somewhat complex to reduce the status of the flat to finite               conclusions within the domain of the two Gates, as they are both               somewhat imperfectly cast in bronze. The high and low reliefs of               both doors echo to a certain extent the visible perforations of               their alloys. Such perforations are at times minor and at times               major. They can be regarded as intentional or accidental marks on               the surfaces of the cast figures and grounds of both Gates. Yet               there remain somewhat definitive differences through which the two               doors in question present images. While the panels of <i>The Gates               of Death</i> do not depart from the figure per se, they seem to               bear no evidence of orthogonal projections in the service of illusionistic               depth. At the same time, however, <i>The Gates of Death</i> remain               figurative, despite the development of twentieth century abstraction.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Among other methods and solutions regarding               representation through bronze reliefs, <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>               contain orthogonally systematized means of producing the illusion               of architecturally framed three-dimensional space. More specifically,               the gates have used &quot;Brunelleschi perspective&quot;, albeit               not fully systematized and not in each panel. Conversely, <i>The               Gates of Death</i> rely on the figure and its ground as the means               of representation. The flat surfaces of the panels here are articulated               through literal piercings, scratches, gashes, and instances of the               unmistakable dissolution of the body parts of the figures. The final               product seems to lack &quot;order,&quot; &quot;theory,&quot; &quot;rule,&quot;               or visual &quot;depth&quot; through perspective. In fact, one could               read the distortion of the figurative as the sign of a departure               from iconic signifieds through the distortion of iconic signifiers.               Here, what seems to be equally at play as figure versus ground are               seemingly random and deviant marks left on metallic surfaces. A               notion which one might be led to associate with <i>The Gates of               Death</i> is partial visual chaos, should one be tempted to link               its binary opposite, order, as a characteristic of the Renaissance,               which adheres to the return to certain intellectual paradigms of               ancient Greece. More specifically, it is the Euclidean theorem of               mathematically calculated proportion that we find revived, theorized               and expanded from the two-dimensional givens of linear geometry               to a &quot;visual pyramid&quot; as a means of representing three-dimensional               space pictorially. <small><sup>3</sup></small> </font></p>            <p><font class="second">This is not to say that the Renaissance can               be reduced to the single judgment of &quot;order,&quot; as a work               of art itself defies verbal reduction. In fact, image versus text,               despite their inseparability on the level of perception, can be               said to remain distinct entities. As much as image and text are               interwoven within the realm of icons, they are physically separate               entities. Image and text remain detached within the domain of the               mind, while they are inseparable therein. I borrow two terms from               a methodology that Damisch proposes in addressing the link between               language (the primary means of art history) and perspective. My               analysis of a few features of the two gates is intended to be &quot;demonstrative&quot;               rather than &quot;declarative.&quot; Addressing the &quot;polysemic&quot;               nature of the image and its problematics in relation to language,               Damisch observes that the gerund <i>painting</i>-and likewise <i>piercing</i>               I would add-is a progressive form of the verb. Such a form, the               author claims, indicates &quot;the essentially performative nature               of a practice that has no existence, in contradiction to language,               save in the act, the exercise.&quot;<small><sup>4</sup></small>               The term &quot;polysemic&quot; is the adjectival counterpart of               the noun &quot;polysemy,&quot; which signifies &quot;many meanings.&quot;               From such a point of view the gates in question continue to bewilder               the spectator, as they both contain adherences to and digressions               from certain established domains of their cultural contexts. Their               juxtaposition furthermore multiplies the possible set of formal               and cultural meanings. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">It is particularly architecture, with its               calculated geometric conditions and the projected coordinate system,               which plays a central role in the two-dimensional representation               of three-dimensional space in a number of Ghiberti's reliefs. This               is not to say that the notion of perspective is obliterated in those               panels where architecture is not a predominant tool for attaining               illusionistic space. Consider, for example, the uppermost left panel               <i>Genesis</i> of the <i>Gates of Paradise</i>. Here, it is primarily               through the diminishing scale of figures arranged in a somewhat               triangular order with a base positioned on the lower edge of the               square that the illusion of depth is signified. Likewise, it is               the varying magnitude of the trees, somewhat diminished in receding               &quot;space,&quot; that evokes three-dimensionality. The very medium               of high relief here is a means of not merely signifying the third               dimension within the no-longer-flat space, but materially raising               above the vertical flatness of the doors. Hence we have at least               a double means of constructed space here: one through the somewhat               gradual but not necessarily consistent shift of the scale of figures,               and another through the very nature of the reliefs. These reliefs               entail the additions and subtractions of form on the panel, which               continue to shift between the domains of the tactile and optical.               The three-dimensional high and low reliefs have put into use two-dimensional               means of representing &quot;depth.&quot; Furthermore, the draperies               of the figures are prominent representations of the culturally manufactured               versus the natural, such as the human body or the pine trees. Yet               these elements, whether they are representations of the cultural               or the natural, remain somewhat apart from the technique of architectural               perspective. An instance of the physical as well as illusionistic               emergence from the two-dimensional space of the relief through applied               linear geometry takes place in the execution of a fragment of architecture.</font></p>            <p><font class="second">Relative to the horizontal, the approximately               30-degree angular inclination of the top of the arch in the <i>Genesis</i>               designates an oblique fa&ccedil;ade. What we have is a partial quadrilateral.               The somewhat vertical yet non-parallel sides of this quadrilateral               approach each other as if to form an inverted V with an absent apex.               This trapezoid is one instance of linear perspective, which denotes               the beholder's position. The beholder is assumed to be at an angle               relative to the fa&ccedil;ade, at a distance from it, and at a lowered               position. However, the remainder of the scenery denotes a spectator               viewing it from an upper level relative to the figures in the foreground.               Therefore the linear and geometric attributes of the arch here emulate               one form of perspectival space. Such an orthogonal representation               of the arch is coupled with the more-or-less scalar establishment               of &quot;depth&quot; or &quot;three-dimensionality&quot; through               the figures. Furthermore, this fragment of architecture &quot;drawn&quot;               through a method of perspective, while physically &quot;piercing&quot;               the flat surface of the alloy as a relief, is itself illusionisticly               and sculpturally punctured. The arch is itself &quot;infiltrated&quot;               through a flying heavenly body (is it an angel or God?), whose central               axis intersects the concentric circles surrounding the Creator.               Shall we incline to the possibility of reading this entry of the               Creator into a moment of perspective as a latent signifier of the               &quot;creation&quot; of perspective as such? </font></p>            <p><font class="second">I would like to set forth one methodological               statement as a relevant answer to the preceding question.

The               mythic &quot;text&quot; is a &quot;context,&quot; which the artist               invests with his own inclinations and talent rather than producing               an objective, or literal, illustration of it.<small><sup>5</sup></small>               </font></blockquote>            <p><font class="second">From such a point of view, then, the signifiers               of <i>Genesis</i> render the representation through linear perspective               as a means of examining questions that suspend the semantic closure               of the icons in question.

The <i>Genesis</i>               relies on a 45 mm projection at the bottom of the panel and a 35               mm recession at the top. Such is the nature of the stage set in               which the scale of the characters are somewhat proportionally depicted               through their heights. The figures are composed in various sequences,               which presume the illusion of space. The <i>Isaac</i>, on the other               hand, depicts a fully worked out linear perspectival model. This               panel utilizes architecture as a vital tool for a geometrically               calculated presentation of depth through methods of linear perspective.               Such a two-dimensional illusion of depth through architecture calls               forth various linear geometric methods &quot;invented&quot; by Filippo               Brunelleschi and later formulated by Leone Battista Alberti. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Richard Krautheimer<small><sup>6</sup></small>               describes the method through which an instance of Renaissance perspective               has been put to use in <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>. Referring to               the <i>Isaac</i>, which he contrasts with the <i>Cain and Abel</i>               regarding its use of perspective, Krautheimer states that &quot;Ghiberti's               art and workmanship reached a climax [of perspectival technique].&quot;<small><sup>7</sup></small>               As it is evident through a glance, the &quot;complex and infinitely               subtle composition is strengthened and indeed, made possible by               the architectural setting which fills almost the entire height of               the relief. A monumental hall with wide arches and tall pilasters               underscores the successive events of the story, setting off the               single scenes in separate spatial units and calling attention to               the protagonists.&quot; <small><sup>8</sup></small> Krautheimer               emphasizes three functions regarding the role of architecture and               its use in the panel.

He assumes that &quot;it is               unlikely that he [Ghiberti] consciously tried to disregard Alberti's               perspective construction.

After all, it has been conjectured that Brunelleschi's             formation of a stable illusion was activated through the insertion             of the reflection of the sky on an area on the painting covered in             silver leaf. The stabilized and idealized eye point and vanishing             point through Brunelleschi's use of an apparatus were intended to             provide the mirror reflection of an image so that the single &quot;eye             point&quot; and the vanishing point were geometrically definable and             precise. Yet the foreclosure of the device was transgressed through             the instability of double reflections: a reflection of the still,             painted picture which was to be destabilized through the &quot;mirror&quot;             of a silver leaf echoing actual clouds of the sky. Damisch addresses             the function of Brunelleschi's silver leaf by linking it to Lacan's             &quot;Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I&quot; by             interrogating:</font>             <blockquote><font class="second">But why the mirror? As opposed to               the unweaned child who acknowledges the mirror image as his own,               and who anticipates, through this form, the Gestalt or bodily integration               and coordination it still lacks, the painter's image is not transformed               by the specular reflection. With regard to unity, the kind of perspectival               coherence characteristic of Brunelleschi's panel, which made it               novel, had nothing imaginary about it, being the fruit of precise               calculations and carefully considered decision: given a construction               organized around a single point of view, the flat mirror did nothing               but reverse its lateral orientation. But this reversal is not without               its problems. For it would seem to provide support for the hypothesis               that Brunelleschi executed his painting with the aid of a mirror,               directly on a reflective surface, in which case he could have needed               to use a second mirror to reestablish conformity with the order               of things, as this image, having been constructed directly on a               mirror reflection, would have effected an exchange of left for right               and right for left. <small><sup>12</sup></small> </font></blockquote>            <p><font class="second">Thus if the <i>lineamenti</i> (the schematic               outlines), the <i>misure</i> (the means of representing reality),               the <i>ragioni</i> (the proportionate relationships), and the <i>casamenti</i>               and <i>piani</i> (the architectural settings) in the reliefs of               <i>The Gates of Paradise</i> disobey the &quot;scientific&quot;               rules of a physically fixed &quot;gaze,&quot; it is because the               semblance of reality could not be totally reduced to a purely Euclidean               geometry; it is because pure geometry remains insufficient as a               means of accounting for the image traced on the retina which resides               within a pulsing body. </font></p>            <table width="111" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="rsarks_6.html" target="_blank"><img src="sar6cont.jpg" width="111" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="rsarks_6.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Lucio Fontana, <i>Concetto Spaziale-Attese</i>, 1963.

As if a means of resisting illusion,               the disintegration of three-dimensional space would become a companion               of the partially dismembered figure in much of visual representation.               Hence the figure would at times dissolve with the ground, as if               to resist depth in order to turn its vantage point to the essential               conditions of its own representation. <i>The Gates of Death</i>               explicitly counteract depth through their own means, without a total               departure from figures under the guise of icons. In fact, the unity               of the figures would be undone through the submission of the index               on them <i>as such</i>; these indexes are marks which were mere               traces first incised on clay in order to be cast in bronze. The               index is a semiotic term that has by now entered the discursive               arena of art. It is as if the partial or total dissolution of the               figure in the visual arts has necessitated an expansion of interpretive               terms. Through the semiotic domain the term index has been marked               as a category of signs apart from symbols and icons. As a large               portion of twentieth-century art has eliminated definitive icons               and symbols, setting forth material and form as content in many               instances, the term index has been attached to the very physicality               of marks and shapes within a given medium. Therefore, while the               icon and the medium forming it were sides of the same coin during               previous centuries, much Western art of the twentieth century, whether               figurative or abstract, departs from the icon as such. It resists               the closure of finite meanings. &quot;Since things are as they are               (&quot;it is as it is, it is as it is,&quot; a formula dear to Kafka,               marker of a state of facts), he will abandon sense, render it no               more than implicit; he will retain only the skeleton of sense, or               a paper cutout.&quot;<small><sup>13</sup></small> </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Why, one may ask, does <i>Death on Earth</i>               (lowermost right panel of <i>Gates of Death</i>) retain the presence               of the figure, including a chair, draperies, the profile of a head               and a crying child? Why does it undo the figure, extending certain               physically negative and positive outlines of the figures, such as               the curves emerging from the child's left hand? Or what is the visual               function of an independent curve on the ground above the chest of               the woman? Along with these floating lines there are also metallic               &quot;points&quot; which are indexes of somewhat random and arbitrary               frottages on clay during the initiation and casting of the relief.               A direct departure from and the questioning of perspective remain               marks of alternative directions of thought in the West. The dissolution               of the figure and its ground as means of attaining the abstract               can be read as partially linked to the individual of the machine               age. Such an individual was also at the threshold of World War I.               The abstractions of Mondrian or Malevich early in the century can               be read as either partially detached from the social field or as               signs of the infrastructures of certain ideologies-or both. The               concepts linked to such works range from the total autonomy and               self-justification of abstraction to its status as a symptom of               prewar social conditions. Such conditions of labor have been identified               under the rubric of technorationalism. These abstractions would               be followed by partial returns to the figure in the works of Le               Corbusier or L&eacute;ger for example, whose organicism indicates a politically               disturbing social field that had been traumatized by two World Wars.<small><sup>14</sup></small>               And the seemingly abstract output of a closer contemporary of Manz&#249;,               such as Lucio Fontana (Figure 3), seems to aim at a means of undoing               the optical autonomy attached to the silence of the monochrome.               If it undoes the silence and autonomy of the monochrome, it is through               a &quot;violent act&quot; performed on the very canvas in order               to render its material underbelly unmistakably &quot;tangible&quot;               through sight. Yet unlike the abstract or &quot;formless&quot; means               of representation which had come to characterize its century as               a central visual direction, <i>The Gates of Death</i> of Manz&#249;               maintain the figure, only to negate it from within, through intentional               incisions and accidental pores. Hence the accident here becomes               a reciprocal parameter of the intentional. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">To maintain, and yet to <i>de</i>-construct               form, to represent death in space yet to undo the void of space               through formless lumps and linear cavities which seem to echo rope               parts, drapery, as well as nothingness-linear cavities as such:               how are we to read these variants situated in an eloquent High Renaissance               edifice, near a pair of Filarete doors? What is the abandonment               of perspective here a sign of, given the availability of Alberti's               <i>Della pittura</i>, Filarete's <i>Treatise on Architecture</i>               and Brunelleschi's lessons as possible means of representing three-dimensional               space through well-formulated architectural theories? What questions               does <i>Death in Space</i> raise regarding the status of the twentieth-century               artist who has departed from Alberti's or Filarete's techniques               of visual representation of three-dimensional space? </font></p>            <p><font class="second">&quot;Once, religion had a power and a reality               touching Dante and Michelangelo and others. At that time, dogmas,               rites, symbols and images had real meaning for man and so, as a               result, [they] did religious art which figured them. But today the               images no longer speak the same way because life is elsewhere in               science and the industrial revolution which has changed the world.&quot;               <small><sup>15</sup></small> These were the sculptor's thoughts               conveyed to Pope John XXIII during the time when the doors were               being put forth in clay in Rome then being sent to Milan to be cast               in bronze. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">However, it would be misleading to reduce               the Renaissance to mere dogma, rites and symbols in the visual filed,               as put forth by Manz&#249; above. Yet the romantic conception of               selfhood hoped for in the past seems to have departed from the individual               of the twentieth century. Or perhaps characterizing the past with               a romantic conception of selfhood or the validity of religion had               led many twentieth-century artists to depart from tradition to its               fullest extent. If there was such a thing as &quot;individual creative               will,&quot; it was to reflect the very parameters of industrial               labor that had entered the venue of art through such notions as               seriality, repetition and depersonalization. Such an approach targets               the end of material perfection within one of its most prohibited               contexts in the Western world in this case-the fa&ccedil;ade of               St. Peter's. From a semiotic standpoint, it would be the index that               would function as a shifter, a destabilizing type of a sign that               would abandon the space of perspective in order to render the icon               itself polysemic. Here, the tactile conditions of the material would               function as a rearticulated sign of what Diderot was to equip the               blind man with in his &quot;Letter of the Blind: For the Use of               Those Who See.&quot; The fictive blind man would state: &quot;it               is touch that alerts us to the presence of certain modifications               that remain imperceptible to the eyes until they have been informed               of them by our sense of touch.&quot;<small><sup>16</sup></small>               And by linking the perspectival ideal to the sense of touch Lacan               would render the categories of the two senses interdependent and               de-stable. Instances of Lacan's discourse seem to be not unlike               the words of Diderot's fictive blind man who said: &quot;Yet we               shall all pass one day, and without any possibility of measuring               either the real space that we once occupied or the exact time that               we have lived. Time, space, and matter are perhaps only a point.&quot;<small><sup>17</sup></small>               <i>The Gates of Death</i>, by destabilizing form through haptic               disjunctions, open themselves up to the alienation of modern man:               lonely, no longer with Christ and Madonna, but perhaps with Karl               Marx.<small><sup>18</sup></small> But even the role of Marx had               come to signify the partial role of money in the self, no longer               the only factor of alienation. Economics is a parameter that Lacan               would add to the matrix of the unconscious conditioned by the visual               and tactile. As if following the path of Diderot's blind man, Lacan               would render time, space and matter as &quot;points.&quot; He would               do so through his use of an unsettled mode of speech and writing.               The haziness of such a notion of &quot;points&quot; in certain ways               parallels the alienation of the subject. Lacan presented his seminar               on alienation on May 27, 1964, a month before the unveiling of <i>The               Gates of Death</i> by Pope Paul VI-June 28, 1964.<small><sup>19</sup></small>               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">The slashes of the monochrome canvas of Lucio               Fontana's <i>Concetto Spaziale-Attese</i> of 1963 pierce the totally               abstracted high modernist myth of the purity of the monochrome.               These cuts expunge the very coherence and stability of form at its               most abstract. Here, the very tool of the index functions as a signifier               whose signifieds would remain without a final interpretant. In <i>The               Gates of Death</i> we witness slashes, cuts and bruises targeted               toward the figure as well as toward the flat space surrounding and               at times dissolving with parts of the figure. Its level of signification               is thus rendered parallel to a numeric order that Lacan borrows               from Descartes in order to illustrate the convolution of alienation:               <small><sup>20</sup></small> </font></p>            <blockquote><font class="second">1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + ( . . . )))).</font></blockquote>            <p><font class="second">Yet while Fontana's index violates the &quot;purity&quot; and autonomy             of the monochrome flat within an unreligious context, Manz&#249;'s             indexical marks were intentional violations of the &quot;purity&quot;             of the flat, the icon and the figure within their most prohibited             place-in the glory-laden shrine of the Eternal City. His mutilation             of the figure renders the status of the Other a companion of the Self.             The status quo of such a Self would remain incalculable, like the             above cardinal order that Lacan selects. The Self and the Other would             here become interchangeable companions of the Figurative and the Abstract.</font></p>            <p><font class="second">In 1966 in Galleria La Salita in Rome, Richard               Serra exhibited <i>Live Animal Habitat</i>. These were cages filled               with live and stuffed animals. Such an approach was a means of departing               from the two-dimensional and entering the realm of the real as such.               Yet this was a realm with no finite beginning and end, but one of               mere production as self-critique.<small><sup>21</sup></small> This               was another means of unveiling the disunity of the Self. The cultural               implications of the physical piercing of the flat in order to give               way to the formless upon <i>The Gates of Death</i> are various.               One means of departing from the objective production of icons for               Manz&#249; was to state the status of the modern subject-uncertain               of a whole self as such, having left behind the role of religion               and that of theoretically established perspectival representation.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Once past the territory of the religious or               the figurative icon, <i>Death in Space</i>, <i>Death on Earth</i>,               <i>Death of Abel</i>, <i>Death by Violence</i> and the other panels               could become replaced by new titles: <i>Drawing the Line, Forging               the Polis; Deterritorialization and the Withdrawal of the Line;               Mass Society and the Collapse of</i> Designo; <i>The Line as Psychic               Horizon; Lines without Subjects; Line as Pure Event; Field, Boundary,               Consciousness</i>. These were the titles of a lecture series entitled               <i>Lines of Sight: The Status of the Line in Modern Visual Representation</i>               that Norman Bryson held at Cooper Union in 1999. Contextually somewhat               distant from <i>The Gates of Death</i>, these titles are nonetheless               companions of <i>The Gates of Death</i> on a broader cultural level.               The status of the line in much of modern visual representation is               a departure from a systematic space marked by a horizon and a vanishing               point. It is a means of &quot;piercing&quot; the flat not through               illusion but through actual marks like those of the graffito artist,               or through cuts such as Fontana's &quot;signature.&quot; Line thus               becomes a pure event, not only to undo the illusion of perspectival               depth, but also to obliterate the notion of absolute purity and               absolute flatness once attached to High Modernism. Such a means               of representation can be read as an attempt to obliterate the notion               of the unity of the Self as well. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">And yet. <i>The Gates of Death</i> and <i>The               Gates of Paradise</i>, despite their utter differences, both digress               from systematization. If <i>The Gates of Death</i> are nonconforming               to certain paradigms of their sanctified or temporal settings, it               is because they adhere to neither the figure as a whole nor the               abstract as such. They depart acutely from Albertian or aberrant               depth as well. The panels of these doors have left the unity of               the outlines and inner shapes of their figures vastly incomplete,               as if to mirror the adamant resistance of the body to utter stability               of <i>any form</i>-whether the corpus is alive, is taking its leave               of life, or has become an inert corpse. The partial figure here               thus becomes an &quot;icon&quot; of the corporeal self which continues               to trade matter with its surrounding, whether this matter is air,               food, light, or the causal agent of some other afferent or efferent               activity. Such is the realm of Lacan's indeterminate <i>object a</i>.               And <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>, despite their partial adoption               of the <i>costruzione legittima</i>, deviate from the Albertian               idealism of a geometrically determined single vanishing point in               their own ways. To begin with, Brunelleschi's single-eye and stationary               adherence to perspective was itself mediated through the instability               of the sky obtained through the reflection on the silver leaf painted               on his Baptistry panel in Florence. Here the motility of the image               of the clouds becomes a conjugate to the dazzling, pulsatile blink               of the eye. This blink remains inimical to purely systematized and               stable norms of visuality. Alberti himself shifts in book II of               <i>Della pittura</i> to warn the reader of the risks of the perspective               paradigm. These risks are to a certain extent flattened in Ghiberti's               rendition of perspective.</font></p>            <P><font class="second"><a href="rsarks_ref.html">References&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </P>            <p><font class="second"><a href="rsarks_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font>           </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Raphy Sarkissian.
