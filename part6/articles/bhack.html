Aberrations from               the acceptable generally emerge to an onslaught of criticism and               contempt from those doomed souls tangled in the quagmire of traditional               practice; for these casualties of artistic revolution, the retreat               into the darkened depths of history is a slow and bitter one. Critics               of the Post-Impressionists and their Modernist progeny were particularly               cantankerous during their descent, desperately holding fast to conventional               modes of representation. For many American artists, such as F.W.               Ruckstull and Lorado Taft, Modernism was a sure sign of human artistic               and psychological decay, an apocalypse first presaged by the arrival               of the Aesthetic Movement.<small><sup>1</sup></small> The art of               the Gilded Age, replete with marble and mural reminders of civic               responsibility, was in many ways a response to the hedonistic, Epicurean               philosophy of the Aesthetic Movement as first propagated by Oscar               Wilde during his lecture tour across America in 1882.</font></P>            <p><small><font class="second">Conservative American critics, vehemently               stolid in the stagnant grandeur of classical historicism, bemoaned               the apparent downward spiral into decadence well into the twentieth               century. They interpreted the Modernist fragmentation of space and               the defilement of the human form as the products of a degenerate,               feeble-minded temperament; such radical, <i>imported</i> notions               of modernity, they argued, were as detrimental to the nation's mental               and physical purity as the influx of (and miscegenation with) immigrant               populations. As F.W. Ruckstull proclaimed in 1917, &quot;If we hope               to preserve our democracy and help it along towards a higher perfection               and prevent ourselves from sliding backwards towards slavery, we               must above all be loyal to the laws and truths of nature.&quot;<sup>2</sup>               It is no coincidence that the rise of Modernism coincided with both               the rises in popularity of eugenics-the misapplication of Charles               Darwin's principle of natural selection to human cultures-and of               an art that expressed its tenets of biological and psychological               perfection. </font></small></p>            <p><small><font class="second">Developed in 1883 by Charles Darwin's               cousin, Francis Galton (1822 -1911), eugenics merged the science               of heredity with the somewhat misguided interpretation of Darwinian               evolution as "survival of the fittest" (a phrase coined by Herbert               Spencer, not Darwin). Eugenic proposals included extensive genealogical               background checks before marriage in order to increase the likelihood               of having perfect children (<i>positive</i> eugenics) and the sterilization               or elimination of those deemed unfit for human procreation (<i>negative</i>               eugenics).<sup>3</sup> The 'Science' of eugenics soon permeated               American biology and hygiene textbooks, marriage manuals, and silent               films such as <i>The Black Stork</i> (1916)<sup>4</sup> which advocated               euthanasia for unfit newborns. Among its many adamant adherents               were John D. Rockefeller, George Eastman, Alexander Graham Bell,               J.H. Kellogg, Margaret Sanger, Theodore Roosevelt, and university               presidents such as Charles W. Eliot (Harvard) and David Starr Jordan               (Stanford). With its moral and patriotic imperative to create the               finest and fittest nation possible, eugenics seemed tailor-made               for the American notion of a progressive society fulfilling the               promise of manifest destiny. </font></small></p>            <p><small><font class="second">A number of influential societies were               established in America to promote eugenic ideals: <i>The Race Betterment               Foundation</i>, led by J.H. Kellogg; <i>The American Breeders Association</i>,               an organization devoted to successful animal husbandry that turned               its attention to human livestock in 1906; <i>The Galton Society</i>;               and <i>The American Eugenics Society</i>. In addition, the Carnegie-funded               <i>Station for Experimental Evolution</i> (1904) and the <i>Eugenics               Record Office</i> (1910) were created at Cold Spring Harbor, New               York, directed by famed eugenicist Charles B. Davenport. Several               International Congresses of Eugenics were held, with devastating               ultimate results: laws permitting the sterilization for criminals               and the developmentally disadvantaged, often performed without their               consent, were put into effect in several states. Such measures were               supported by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who famously maintained               &quot;It is better for all the world if instead of waiting to execute               degenerate offspring for crime, or let them starve for their imbecility,               society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing               their kind.&quot;<sup>5</sup> Families proving themselves genetically               pure would vie for glory and <a href="http://kbccartsmart.tripod.com/panamapacific/id3.html" target="_blank">medals</a>               in &quot;Fittest Family&quot; contests in county fairs across the               nation. </font></small></p>            <p><small><font class="second">The expression of eugenics in sculpture,               if addressed at all, has been generally relegated to the idealized               depictions (largely despised/ignored by art historians) of Aryan               nationalism during the Third Reich.<sup>6</sup> American figurative               sculpture, equally infused with idealized forms embodying human               perfection, is typically perceived as <i>classical</i> or as <i>Beaux-Arts-inspired</i>               rather than as emblematic of current biological thought. Representational               sculpture in the age of Modernism was, however, not merely a carryover               from the century past, but an active response-albeit one of desperation-to               what was perceived as the degradation of form. Its advocates-convinced               that the cubist and futurist butchers were mentally and morally               degenerate-worked in silent collusion with the promoters of eugenics.               </font></small></p>            <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="bhack_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="hac1cont.jpg" width="210" height="125" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="bhack_1.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     Race Betterment Exhibit, Panama-Pacific International Exposition,                     San Francisco, 1915. <br>                    From: Frank Morton Todd, The Story of the Exposition (New                     York: G.P.

Among the advancements               noted by one exposition reporter were the wireless, the aeroplane,               the automobile, and &quot;selective breeding&quot;.<sup>8</sup>               The Second Race Betterment Congress was held in conjunction with               the fair (the first was held at Battle Creek, Michigan, home of               the famed sanitarium directed by J.H. Kellogg); so popular was the               Congress that &quot;Race Betterment Week&quot; was declared at the               exposition.

Representing the strong-willed               American spirit, Grafly's matriarch sternly offers her naturally               eugenic offspring-nude in their Nordic splendor-to the future.

Kr&oslash;yer and L&eacute;on Fr&eacute;deric, as well               as with Scandinavian authors such as Knut Hansun and Henrik Ibsen               (although like the work of Edvard Munch, Ibsen's genetically-cursed               characters seem arguments for eugenics rather than displays of its               glorious results). The theme of biological inheritance loomed large               in the art and literature of the Nordic countries, all of which               practiced enforced sterilization-a fact which, unsurprisingly, American               eugenicists applauded.

Although eugenics lost its credibility               with most scientists during the 1920s, the pseudo-science retained               public interest until the Second World War, when the horrifying               consequences of national eugenics became brutally apparent. </font></small></p>            <p><small><font class="second">The triumph of Abstraction, a victory               which seems so inevitable and righteous in hindsight, has watered               down the vitriol which deluged its historical moment; decades before               <i>Entartete Kunst</i>, respected American thinkers were labeling               Modern Art &quot;the expression of mental dyspepsia and physical               impotence.&quot;<sup>27</sup> A reassessment of the concept of Modernism               in terms of the eugenic response of American artists and critics,               one which keeps in mind the fact that James Earle Fraser, Sherry               Fry, Edith Woodman Burroughs, Chester Beach, and Robert I.
