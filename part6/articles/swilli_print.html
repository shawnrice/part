Murray's groundbreaking illustration of negative stereotype         in visual art was an intellectual argument for black self-determination.         Pan-African art criticism gained mass appeal during the Harlem Renaissance         with the publishing of <i>The New Negro</i> (1925), by philosopher Alain         Locke. In his book, he prescribed the reclamation of African culture for         growing numbers of professional African American artists. Both Murray's         and Locke's theories were closely associated with W.E.B. Du Bois' promotion         of positive images of blacks. From their two perspectives Fuller's <i>Ethopia         Awakening</i> was deemed the visual epitome of the &quot;Talented Tenth&quot;         movement. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Mary Schmidt Campbell attributes the influence for         <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> to Du Boisian philosophy, which &quot;emphasized         the Black Americans' common African heritage.&quot; Current scholarship         by Richard Powell cites Judith Wilson's claim that the &quot;utopian,         Pan Africanist novel&quot; <i>Ethiopia Unbound</i> (1911) by west African         activist lawyer, J.E. Casely Hayford as Fuller's source of inspiration.         In response, I strongly suggest that <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was not         the epitome of Du Boisian philosophy or any other Mr. Hayford's semi-autobiographical         novel. Rather, it was the manifestation of Fuller's own Pan-Africanist         feminism recognizing her collaboration with Garveyite feminist Adelaide         Casely Hayford (J.E. Hayford's ex-wife) in 1920 to build an all girls         school in Sierra Leone. </font></p>      <table width="104" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="swilli_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="wil1cont.jpg" width="109" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="swilli_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               Portrait of Meta Warwick Fuller from Bridgewater College's</font></a> <font class="sixth">               <a href="http://www.bridgew.edu/HOBA/fuller.htm" target="_blank">Hall               of Black Achievement</a></font></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font class="second">It makes sense that the initial inspiration for         <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was Fuller's understanding of Murray's call for         an interventionist avant-garde. Fuller proposed to make her own version         of an Africa figure after critically reading his manuscript, around 1915.         <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was a response to the pleas of the intelligentsia         that proclaimed the spiritual and political relevance of Africa for African         Americans. The sculpture also reiterated, for the entire black world,         the elation and pride that the widely publicized Ethiopian victory over         Italian colonial powers during the era. Murray's arguments, including         supportive visual material, revealed that Daniel Chester French, and many         other sculptors before him, created illusory and undesirable images to         bear on black people. However, the discussion of feminism in this paper         isolates three female statues of &quot;Africa&quot; to juxtapose another         viable process in <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>, which is supported by contemporary         Post-Colonial gender studies in art history. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Murray examined a number of sculpted female figures         known as &quot;Africa.&quot; during the American Renaissance (1865-1917),         a period of Neo-classical revival in art. &quot;Africa&quot; figures were         created specifically as tributes to the Emancipation Proclamation following         the Civil War (1861-1864). These markers of freedom testified to the libertarian         spirit of the founding fathers. At the same time that they celebrated         a vision of independence, the figures represented Western paternalism         and empire by illustrating Africa as naturally submissive, yielding, and         uncultivated. </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><i>Ethopia Awakening</i> (1863) by the American         woman sculptor Anne Whitney, was an example of a pre-Emancipation &quot;Africa&quot;         figure in chains. Whitney's, like other Orientalist paintings and sculptures         about Africa, depicted a scantily clad, idyllic Odalisque in white marble.         The glistening, decidedly non- African looking, &quot;Africa,&quot; awakened         from her sleep and lifted her veil to expose her body from a horizontal         position. Whitney attributed classical beauty and symbolic enlightenment         as a positive statement about the impending freedom of enslaved African         Americans. It is important to note that although Whitney intended the         white marble sculpture to allude to Africa, it was through the visual         language of Greek myths. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Mary Livermore in <i>Our Famous Women</i> (1883)         described Whitney's depiction of a slave as a representation of abolitionist         goals. Livermore stated, she &quot;listened with fear and wonder to the         sound of broken chains and shackles falling around her.&quot; According         to Livermore, Whitney's cause was so &quot;legible and well-expressed         that even the uninstructed in art throbbed in sympathy with it.&quot;         Livermore added that the &quot;recumbent . colossal&quot; expressed the         teeming luxuriance of the tropics in which she had her birth.&quot; Orientalist         tropes were seamlessly constructed in Livermore' critique. The discussion         of freedom for Africans in America was depicted by a woman upon whom a         curiously seductive gaze was focused onto body and land. A reconfigured         desire for power and possession is transmitted in such pronounced sexual         overtones. The figure's denoted exoticism and eroticism conveyed the colonial         voyeuristic tendencies in art and real life mistreatment of women in the         colonies. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Contrary to Livermore's reading of Whitney's abolitionist         aesthetics, the sculpture blurred the historical fact of American slavery         and of black people. This image did not denounce slavery. It relied heavily         on the subject of non-European slave holding traditions, such as harems,         in which control over blacks and women were foreign or essential cultural         traditions, to circumvent America's history. Moreover, Whitney's romanticism,         with its emphasis on beauty and pleasure diverted from any re-examination         of the horrible circumstances of slavery or of the remarkable contribution         blacks made to the Industrial Revolution. Interesting to note, Whitney         eventually destroyed the female figure and later carved a monument for         the martyred abolitionist John Brown. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Daniel Chester French's &quot;Africa&quot; from         his New York Customs House grouping of <i>The Four Continents</i> (1906)         repeated the portrayal of the sleeping &quot;Africa.&quot; In a comparison         with the earlier grouping of nude caryatids done in France, known as <i>Four         Continents</i> by the sculptor Jean Baptiste Carpeaux (1868-74), the American         sculptor, French, reiterated a remarked imperialist view of Africa in         America. In Carpeaux's coterie, &quot;Africa&quot; &quot;Asia&quot; &quot;Europe&quot;         and &quot;the Americas&quot; represented all as equals. All were nude         women; all subjects of colonialism on some level. The four standing figures,         in contrast to delicate female representations, supported a globe with         upswept arms of modeled muscle and sinew. Carpeaux wanted to patina stain         the different skin tones, but ultimately showed race through details such         &quot;America's&quot; feathered headdress and the broken shackle at &quot;Africa's&quot;         ankle. Carpeaux rejected pictorial nudity, as well as palliated portrayal         of Africans. The face of &quot;Africa&quot; was naturalistically molded         after an intense-looking black woman with broad features and thick lips.         French critic Paul de Saint-Victoire wrote the predictable insult in La         Liberte, June 22, 1872 that the figures were &quot;neither man, nor woman,         all negresses.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font class="second">French's continents are massively carved out of         monumental blocks of marble. &quot;Africa's&quot; weighty form, with slouched         shoulders and drooping countenance, actually inferred a drunken stupor.         Her garment, which fell from one shoulder and revealed her breast, was         an additional disgrace. The side view of the sculpture showed that &quot;Africa&quot;         slept on a sphinx statue or throne [surely a reference to vanquished leadership].         Figuratively, French's internationally acclaimed statue made a challenge         to ancient Egyptian craftsmen by diminishing the sphinx, also the most         verifiable proof of African accomplishment and civilization. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Demoralizing &quot;Africa&quot; was more apparent         in French's work for other reasons. As financial district landmarks, just         across from Ellis Island, French's Custom House statues put &quot;Africa&quot;         within the context of an ever-expanding dialogue on the American empire.         Absolute power counted its trophies by erecting architectural structures         to declare their domination. For example, the four continents reflect         the United States control over exclusive labor forces of resident African         Americans and newly-arrived immigrants, as well as the international,         industrial labor projects on the Panama Canal, in the Philippines, and         rubber plantations in Liberia. French's &quot;Africa&quot; portrayed American         opportunity in the land of the free for barons of industry and wealth         that contrasted to racially prejudicial images of laboring classes. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The visual statement that French made about the         relationships between white America and non-whites, indigenous colonials         in Africa, Asia, and the Americas were the same statements that Pan-Africanist         scholarship sought to disrupt. Such biased depictions were in direct contrast         to their emergent socio-economic identity. Freeman Murray critiqued the         contemporary tradition in &quot;Africa&quot; sculpture in his independently         published <i>Emancipation and the Freed in Sculpture</i> (1916) as evidence         of repressive culture in America and Pan-Africanist positions to eradicate         visually-expounded stereotypes of blacks as vulgar, comedic, or intellectually         inferior. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Murray wanted this book to set up criteria for sculptors         of public monuments, such as French, which reinforced racist postures.         He wanted them to be held accountable to blacks for these depictions.         In his examination of the wideness and thinness of mouths and nostrils         in numerous sculptures representing blacks, Murray contested the use of         European facial features for Africans. In <i>Emancipation and the Freed         In Sculpture</i>, Murray did not fully examine the role of American Imperialism,         foreign and domestic policy, as it pertained to people of color and labor.         However, he continuously dismissed the Europeanized or &quot;half-cast&quot;         features of &quot;Africa&quot; as concessions to promote the oppression         and total erasure of black culture. He stated in the preface of the book:         </font></p>      <blockquote><font class="second">I am convinced that, for Black Folk - in         America, at least - this is of paramount importance. Under the anomalous         conditions prevailing in this country, any recognition of Black Folks         in art works are intended for public view, is apt to be pleasing to us.         But it does not follow that ever such recognition is creditable and helpful;         some of them, indeed are just the opposite.If, however, the discussions         and attempted analyses herein, tend to encourage or to initiate, in other         persons, candid statements and critical analysis in the matters now under         consideration, one of my main purposes will be accomplished .Interpretation--         which includes: intention, meaning, effect -is of such paramount importance,         that I would not wish to distract attention from it by extensive technical         criticism, even if I felt myself competent to indulge in such criticism.</font></blockquote>      <p><font class="second">At times, he acted as an apologist to escape the         true indignation that these sculptures garnered. He gave French's &quot;Africa&quot;         only a slight punition and probed, instead, for its redeeming qualities.         For example, although &quot;Africa&quot; in French's Custom House Group         is unconscious, Murray translated that as &quot;but dozing, napping, she         sits ready to rouse herself on slight alarm.&quot; Murray goes further         to inscribe some personality, she is brooding&quot; Humanity who contemplates         the devastation of Africa. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Murray also reprinted a 1906 review of French's         &quot;Africa&quot; that was originally published in the popular American         magazine, <i>The Craftsman</i>. He attacked that review, in which the         sculpture was described as &quot;a young woman, sumptuously molded, and         with features suggestive of an idealized type rather than the ancient         Egyptian.&quot; Although the reviewers words: &quot;young, sumptuous,         and idealized&quot; were obvious compliments to French, based on his decision         to lend European standards of beauty to a representation of a non-white,         Murray attempted to argue against the erotic value placed on French's         &quot;Africa.&quot; He stated: &quot;Her fallen mantle exposes for our         admiration - or admonition a more than Amazonian form.&quot; This bifurcated         analysis refuted a singular standard of beauty. However, what is obvious         to the reader, at that moment, is that Murray was disinclined to address         the relationship between body, bondage, and power. In the depiction of         a &quot;Europeanized&quot; woman as &quot; Africa&quot; resides a formula         that prohibited a critical reading by a black male. White women were deemed         the intellectual and physical subject/object of the white male only. The         same could not hold true for black men, of any educated class, such as         Murray. Although he sought to expose the repressive social and cultural         milieu, Murray was undermined by the violent racist temperament of his         society. He understood the taboos, even the risks, of addressing the nudity         of a white female, of marble or in flesh, in 1916, even through scholarship.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Murray knew that his racially based arguments were         political but might not have any basis in art criticism. In 1915, he chose         the black woman sculptor Meta Warrick Fuller (1877-1968) as his critical         reader because, since 1907, when she created <i>Negro's Progress</i>,         she was considered a sculptor of Negro types. She defined an ideal black         physiognomy in her <i>Spirit of the Emancipation</i> (1913), which reflected         a mastery of anatomy, as well as clearly articulated negroid facial features,         commonly associated with sub-Saharan Africans. Thereby, Murray stated         that she &quot;documented her evolving racial consciousness, as well as         her expanding artistic talent.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Fuller first gained attention from DuBois in 1900         when, as an art student in Paris, she entertained African Americans visiting         the Paris Exposition She was one of the first women to attend the Ecole         des Beaux Arts, which opened its doors to women at the very end of the         nineteenth-century. Fuller's achievements were encouraged by an openly         feminist, black middle-class society. Opportunities that were available         to black women in her sphere heightened their financial independence,         as well as their abilities to appropriate white, upper middle-class values.         Her father was a master barber and had a contagious love of art. He analyzed         and interpreted paintings and sculpture on their regular visits to the         Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Soon after her post-graduate art         training at the Pennsylvania Museum School for Industrial Arts, her father         passed away. Her mother, who was an expert wig-maker, and her aunt, who         owned prime real estate, insisted that Fuller travel to Paris. The two         women funded her studies there from 1899 - 1902. In 1902, she first visited         Rodin at Meudon and showed him many works and was greatly inspired. The         influence of this controversial sculptor was certainly felt in her mannerist         modeling of a <i>Man Eating Out His Heart</i> (1905-6) after Stephen Crane's         poem, entitled <i>Secret Sorrow</i>. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Fuller's mature style, after 1906, was motivated         by the social and political realities of her time. As a black artist in         America, segregation barred her from the career she planned in Paris.         After returning home, she made an impact where she could by depicting         historical images of blacks, a subject matter that evolved from her commissions         for Negro exhibitions. The theme of the black experience is thereby analogous         to those in avant- garde Modernism, which articulated the rise of the         peasant class, rather than interpretations of upper class symbols. Fuller's         view of an iconic black image was distinctly different from Murray's aesthetics.         In her reviews of Murray's overall thesis, Fuller was overwhelmingly convinced         that the &quot;half-caste&quot; model for representations of blacks by         white artists constituted artistic style, which was justifiable in and         of itself. </font></p>      <blockquote><font class="second">You forget that there is artistic license         as well, and just because a person has a sitter before them they are not         duty bound to copy all they see. Art is not copying. Anyone with a reasonable         amount of training can copy but it is for the artist to take or have what         he chooses to discriminate - to exaggerate here - to suppress there -         to reconstruct somewhere else - anything that will give emphasis to the         inner being he wishes to represent - this is where genius comes in.</font></blockquote>      <p><font class="second">Fuller's values concretized a more thorough assessment         and corrective of the blatant sexism in racialized &quot;Africa&quot;         figures in <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>. Hers was a different approach from         Murray's and other Pan-Africanists' who were clearly still working with         making trophies in their own image, while Fuller was dealing with more         substantive conditions beyond surface aesthetics - a Pan-African feminism.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Fuller's collaboration with Garveyite Hayford (1868-1960)         allowed both women to actively express their moral convictions and political         platforms. They were encouraged in 1920, the year before <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>         was created, and when women's Suffragette movements finally succeeded         in attaining voting rights for women. In 1919, Fuller created a tribute         to a lynched pregnant woman, entitled <i>Mary Turner: A Silent Protest         Against Mob Violence</i>. There is little doubt that Fuller's Pan-Africanist         feminism was strengthened from her association with Marcus Garvey's Universal         Negro Improvement Association. It was a departure from &quot;Talented         Tenth&quot; circles and the bi-partisan politics that Pan-African male         leadership, specifically Marcus Garvey and DuBois, thrived on. Furthermore,         Garvey trained women in areas of industrial/vocational training, the study         of African culture, and leadership roles. The movement recognized feminists'         issues such as, education, moral motherhood versus career, and women's         health and diet, in direct response to the post-emancipation female condition.         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Hayford, also an inspiration, was born into a colonial         bourgeois and racially mixed civil servant family. Like Fuller's, her         early life involved social events at church, school, and clubs. She rose         to presidency of her Freetown women's UNIA in 1919 and then announced         her intentions to build an all-girls' school in Freetown. The curriculum         would reintroduce and promote precolonial values such as communalism into         the colonial society. In 1923, Hayford returned to Freetown, Sierra Leone         and later wrote of her vision: </font></p>      <blockquote><font class="second">In my mind's eye I could see a school in         which girls, instead of blindly copying European fashions, would be dressed         in attractive native garments which would enhance their personal charms.I         could hear the young mothers teaching their sons the glory of Black citizenship,         rather than encouraging them to bewail the fact that they were not white.I         could imagine the artistic youth of the hereafter painting pictures depicting         black faces not white.I could visualize the listless, lethargic, educated         town girl of today, through the medium of well-equipped gymnasiums and         trained physical cultures enjoying the energy and vitality of her grandmother         who thought nothing of spending days hoeing fields or carrying a load         as weighty as any man's. And then I could picture the sons and daughters         of Africa's race 'looking the whole world in the face' without any apology         whatsoever for the color of their skins, and with such self-respect as         to command the respect of all nations.</font></blockquote>      <p><font class="second">Hayford and Fuller wrote and produced a benefit         staging of a Middle Passage drama, entitled &quot;The Answer&quot; to         fundraise for the school, which was performed at black churches. In the         drama, as well as her own version of <i>Ethopia Awakening</i>, Fuller         promoted an assertion of womanhood and an outpouring of purposeful ambition.         In the sculptor's words, the figure showed the process of &quot;awakening,         gradually unwinding the bandages of [her] past and looking out on life         again, expectant but unafraid.&quot; Fuller's <i>Ethiopia</i> depicted         the stripping away of old garments, as Hayford deemed necessary. This         common denominator illustrated their belief in a proactive and aesthetic         approach for the advancement of black women. Whereas Hayford refuted the         &quot;blindly&quot; copied European fashions for &quot;native garments,&quot;         Fuller's comment to Murray: &quot;art is not copying&quot; echoed the         same sentiment. These women wanted to challenge the status quo on all         grounds; their newly-formed choices would promote positive self-image.         In turn, that liberating image was manifested within black female spaces         such as the black church, and the home, as well as in the visible outer         community. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">In comparison with numerous other &quot;Africa&quot;         figures, <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> may be the only standing figure that         is not a caryatid. It is an intellectual symbol. By clothing &quot;Africa&quot;         the statue differed from the nude spectacles of the past, reversed the         gaze, and alluded to self-contemplation within the female domain. Moreover,         Fuller reconfigured the &quot;Africa&quot; figures' iconography and inserted         her own portrait for the face. Theatrically posed, the petite woman held         her small hand to her breast. In its refutation of languorous nudity,         Fuller's sculpture did not preclude a doll-like quality analogous to Hayford's         remark on &quot;personal charm.&quot; In fact, the pose originated in         so many fashion figures or mannequins, particularly illustrations in women's         magazines at the time. The small size of the statue, about five feet tall,         was easily received. It seems physically and psychologically directed         at a female audience. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">To further fixate on its feminist message, I suggest         its relevance to Hayford's liberal arts initiative and its relationship         to women's mental and physical health. Around 1919, corsets were connected         to prenatal and gynocentric problems and lost popularity. A healthier         and less constricting, form of undergarment that looks similar to the         wrappings on Fuller's statue replaced the earlier hourglass version. This         was apparently not in contrast with Hayford's prescribed abandonment of         European fashions, and a return to traditional African standards of beauty         and well-being. Thereby a clearer understanding of how the mummy wrappings         of &quot;Ethiopia's&quot; lower body alluded not to death but to ancestral,         spiritual beliefs in continuous rebirth from which the consciousness of         the woman emerges. </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was divided into three         &quot;spatial tropes&quot; or three registers of the body. The feet and         legs are restricted, not unlike depictions of chained &quot;Africa&quot;         figures and slavery is not a discarded or hanging metaphor. Ethiopia's         clothed torso, in the second register, purposely resisted any likeness         to the seductive captive image. In that, Fuller's revision addressed the         notion of the submissive, feminized black race and its importance to male         fantasies, as Murray never did. One arm rested at her side while the other         hand was placed at the heart -- caught in a moment of self-reflection.         A cerebral awakening was produced by a heavily-modeled surface and the         &quot;quickened light&quot; it created, in contrast to the figure's tightly,         compacted plasticity. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The third register, often described as a pharaoh's         crown, conveyed a pyramidal shape over the columnar body through a simply-draped         cloth on the head. The compressed planes of the face, the head, and the         headdress are slightly too large. Fuller's digressed from the former naturalism         in her portrait and anatomical studies in order to explore Cubist aspects,         such as those informed by African &quot;primitive art,&quot; although         no other Cubist elements exist in the sculptor's oeuvre. Ethiopia's rhythmic         lines, angular curves, and overall geometricity are signs of abstraction         which art historian Judith Wilson viewed as &quot;stylistic cues from         African sources,&quot; merely the usage of &quot;key tropes&quot; to articulate         an African theme, without Cubist aims. Art scholar Mary Campbell stated         strongly that it is &quot;among the earliest examples of American art         to reflect the formal exigencies of an aesthetics based on African sculpture.&quot;         </font></p>      <p><font class="second"><i>Ethiopia</i> actually prefigured Locke's promotion         of African-inspired modernism, which he termed the &quot;African legacy.&quot;         In fact, Locke could have responded to the new plasticity which Fuller         modeled in the head, torso, and lower extremities. If that is true, her         experimentation with African art was inspired by something more -- it         was an aesthetic derived from her activist affiliation with Hayford's         efforts to educate black women. As the eye follows the tilted head down         the edges of the headdress, the expressive hand secures the drapery at         her bosom. <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> conveys a taking of vows and a noble         commitment that I suggest was a dialogue with other women. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Ethiopia's raised countenance connotes determination.         Fuller's philosophical statement in <i>Ethopia Awakening</i> was not inspired         by Du Boisian Pan-Africanism or by the espousal of Locke's theories of         the ancestral modernism. Fuller's conception of Africa bloomed during         the time she participated with Hayford in the feminist vision to educate         African women. In this way, the work reflected major changes in the self-conception         of women who designated the rise of black female agency during the early         twentieth century.</font></p>      <p><font class="second"><b>Links</b></font><br>      </p>      <p><font class="second">Meta Warrick Fuller - <a href="http:// metalab.unc.edu/docsouth/brawley/brawley.html" target="_blank">http://metalab.unc.edu/docsouth/brawley/brawley.html</a><br>        [lovely photo portrait of Fuller from Benjamin Brawley's Women of Achievement].</font></p>      <p><font class="second"><i>Ethopia Awakening</i> [Fuller] - <a href="http://www.csupomona.edu/~plin/women2/fuller.html" target="_blank">         http://www.csupomona.edu/~plin/women2/fuller.html</a> <br>        [small photographic image of the statue]. </font></p>      <p><font class="second">Negro's Progress - <a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu" target="_blank">         http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu</a></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="1">&copy;         2000 Part and Stacey Williams.
