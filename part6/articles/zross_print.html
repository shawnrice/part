In his early works Brancusi explored the sculptural         styles of a variety of non-Western, so-called &quot;primitive&quot; cultures.         He followed a mimetic sculptural process in an effort to draw himself         closer to the implied spiritual content of these traditional art forms.         By doing so, Brancusi hoped to construct a visual language capable of         expressing his spiritual views of the universe. As he probed various non-western         sculptural styles for meaningful symbolic representation, he either accepted         or rejected the forms based on the compatibility of each style's implied         spiritual content with his own views of the universe. By 1925, having         entered the mature phase of his career, Brancusi had assimilated a variety         of formal influences and had joined them together in a style that is at         once unique and referential to the sculptural traditions of other cultures.</font></p>      <p> <font class="second">Recent critics have sought to deconstruct the individuality         of Brancusi's sculptural style by analyzing the formal similarities between         his work and &quot;primitive&quot; art forms or ideas: African tribal         art, archaic art, Eastern religions - particularly the writings of the         Tibetan monk Milarepa - among others. The readings of these similarities         are then supported by several types of evidence, including Brancusi's         position within the circle of Parisian avant-garde artists, evidence of         his trips to museums known for their &quot;primitive&quot; art collections,         quotes from the artist, other secondhand accounts, etc. Most Brancusi         scholars agree that each of the sources mentioned above have had some         influence upon his art; they each tend to acknowledge the work of others         while proceeding on with his/her own thesis.<small><sup>1</sup></small></font></p>      <font class="second">Brancusi's Rumanian heritage, however, is one source       of artistic inspiration that has elicited a disparate array of responses.       Critics have had a hard time accounting for the degree to which Brancusi       drew upon Rumanian folk traditions for inspiration in his work. Some critics       maintain that there is only slight evidence of a link to these traditions,       while others maintain that Brancusi's ancestral origins provide the fundamental       basis of his work. Although the range of interpretations is wide and varied,       the readings of Brancusi's ties to Rumanian folklore occupies a central       position in the critical discourse on Brancusi, serving as the major point       of distinction among scholars. </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">The search for Rumanian sources in Brancusi's art is       a complicated matter. The reasons for this are several: There are few direct       references to Rumanian folklore in his art (only one sculpture, <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>,       has a Rumanian title), and the formal elements of his work that have been       identified as Rumanian in nature also resemble images and concepts from       a variety of other cultures and religions. Clouding the issue is the fact       that Brancusi actively promoted an identity of himself as a Rumanian peasant       tied to the ancestral traditions of his homeland. This self-construction       has tempted critics to read in Rumanian sources in Brancusi's work despite       the scant evidence of direct ties between his art and folk art traditions       of his homeland. This has led to the reception of Brancusi as a sagely peasant       living in Paris, an outsider to the trends of modernity sweeping across       the city. This essay attempts to define the central role that Brancusi's       self-construction has played in influencing the readings of his work. It       then relates this discussion of identity to two works by Brancusi that critics       have put forth as evidence of links between his style and visual motifs       from Rumanian folk art, the <i>Ma&#239;astra</i> and the <i>Endless Column</i>.       </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">Brancusi was born in a rural region of Rumania known       as Oltenia, in the town of Hobitza. His parents were peasants and small       landholders. Around 1887, at which point Brancusi would have been the age       of 11, <small><sup>2</sup></small> he ran away from home to Tirgu Jiu, where       he later erected his only public monument. There he stayed until 1892, when       he went to Craiova. Three years later, at the age of 22, he graduated with       honors from the Craiova School of Arts and Crafts. He received a grant and       went to Bucharest to study at the School of Fine Arts for three more years,       where he distinguished himself and won many awards. In 1904, he left for       Paris, most of the way on foot, and he remained there, with the exception       of a few short trips, for the rest of his life. </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">In 1907, Brancusi became an assistant in Rodin's studio.       At the time, Rodin's studio was a bustling production line, with approximately       50 assistants working under the great sculptor. Brancusi worked there only       one month. <small><sup>3</sup></small> When asked later as to why he left,       Brancusi responded with one of his typical aphorisms: &quot;Nothing grows       in the shadow of great trees.&quot; After leaving Rodin, Brancusi changed       his sculptural style completely. He eschewed Rodin's sensual and dramatic       aesthetic in favor of new, minimalistic forms. He dropped the traditional       modeling techniques and moved to direct carving as he began exploring a       new, wholly distinctive sculptural style. </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">Many scholars have sought to deconstruct Brancusi's       style by locating exact sources of formal influence. Most of these efforts       have surrounded the influence of so-called &quot;primitive&quot; sculptural       styles, that is, sculpture from outside the Western academic tradition.       These investigations have revealed a variety of such sources of artistic       inspiration. </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">What must be understood before a formal analysis of       the connection between Brancusi's art and these &quot;primitive&quot; sculptural       traditions can be undertaken is that, from the very beginning, the critical       reception of Brancusi's art has been shaped by the perception of his Rumanian       heritage. It has been noted that Brancusi's art &quot;betrays the grafting       of a <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> Paris onto the mystic and rough trunk of       folkloric Rumania.&quot;<small><sup>4</sup></small> This type of analysis       has tended to work in Brancusi's favor, for his &quot;peasant&quot; identity       oftentimes placed him, by the hands of the critics, closer to the essential       qualities of &quot;primitive&quot; arts, and thus above reproach for appropriating       &quot;primitive&quot; styles. In this vein, he has been described as &quot;like       a forest creature&quot;<small><sup>6</sup></small> and as &quot;half god,       half faun.&quot;<small><sup>6</sup></small> As Claire Guilbert said in 1957       about Brancusi, while other artists of the Parisian avant-garde &quot;submitted       to the influence of negro masks and primitive arts, this Rumanian peasant,       who is a real primitive, found himself on an even footing with them.&quot;<small><sup>7</sup></small>       Analyses such as these serve to subjugate the influences of ideas from other       cultures to those of Rumania, in effect classifying them as secondary and       derivative. </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">Brancusi's Rumanian heritage has also functioned in       a seemingly opposite fashion. A contemporary account of his work from the       1930s maintained that &quot;instead of examining the negroes like the cubists       had done Brancusi simply recalled the memories of his childhood, the immaculate       whiteness of Rumanian churches perhaps, the purity of their marvellously       [<i>sic</i>] free and outlandish style, where Byzantine, Roman and Gothic       dispute their titles and positions with folklore.&quot; <small><sup>8</sup></small>       This is interesting in that although Brancusi's Rumanian heritage is used       here to repudiate the influence of African art on his work (which irrefutably       had an impact on Brancusi<small><sup>9</sup></small>), Brancusi's heritage       is again offered as a spiritually &quot;pure&quot; source of stylistic inspiration.       Another more recent critic elevates Brancusi's status as an outsider to       Western sculptural tradition to a fundamental position in 20th-century art       by positing that sculpture &quot;needed the detachment of a sculptor brought       up <i>in an alien tradition</i> to move beyond the accomplishments of Rodin.&quot;<small><sup>10</sup></small>       The contexts in which his ancestry has been invoked both during his lifetime       and up to the present are too many to number. </font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">Brancusi's Rumanian heritage thus serves as a frequent       point of departure for all subsequent formal analyses of his work. One cannot       undertake any study of Brancusi's sculpture without addressing the question       of his origins. Brancusi himself encouraged his audience to make this assumption:       &quot;My laws are those of Craiova where I spent the decisive years of my       youth.&quot;<small><sup>11</sup></small> Indeed, the major reason critics       have looked to Rumanian folk traditions for sources of influence in Brancusi's       sculpture is due to the artist's own efforts to portray himself publicly       as a Rumanian peasant. Brancusi kept his studio in the fashion of a peasant's       home. He often wore peasant's clothing, even to formal occasions.<small><sup>12</sup></small>       He carved all of his own furniture, including the stove. He treated his       sculptures as his family - he's even said to have wept at the sale of one       of his works.<small><sup>13</sup></small> But most of all, Brancusi promoted       himself as a peasant by speaking in colorful aphorisms, in essence promoting       a popular idea of &quot;peasant wisdom.&quot;<small><sup>14</sup></small></font>      <p></p>      <font class="second">Many of these aphorisms refer to his life as a Rumanian:</font>       <blockquote><font class="second">In my native village in the Carpathians         life was happy, without quarrels and illnesses; this was because the civilization         that spoils everything had not yet arrived.<small><sup>15</sup></small></font>        <p>         <font class="second">From the plenitude of my sunny province, I built         a reserve of joy for my entire life; only in this way was I able to resist.<small><sup>16</sup></small></font>        <p> <font class="second">Life was happy, without quarrels or sicknesses,           because the civilization that makes things false had never come there.<small><sup>17</sup></small>           </font>      </blockquote>      <font class="second">These quotes are interesting because, even though he       ran away from home at a very early age, and left for Paris once he had the       chance, as he grew older, Brancusi felt a need to idealize those traditions       as part of his self-fashioning.</font>      <p> <font class="second">Brancusi's self-portrayal as a peasant had a predictable         effect on his critics: &quot;Wearing white pajamas and a yellow, gnomelike         cap, Brancusi today &#133;leads the same humble life he led as a peasant         boy in Rumania before the turn of the century,&quot;<small><sup>18</sup></small>         and it was presumably there that &quot;he began his lifelong quest for         forms which would convey the essence of things.&quot;<small><sup>19</sup></small>         This type of reductive comparison to a child was espoused on many occasions,         with critics describing his art as portraying &quot;a universe seen with         childlike innocence and rendered with archaic simplicity.&quot;<small><sup>20</sup></small>         Brancusi reinforced this perception by maintaining that &quot;when we         are no longer children, we are already dead.&quot;<small><sup>21</sup></small>         Under this construction, Brancusi's &quot;childlike&quot; vision gave         him access to a formal language beyond the limits of the &quot;modern&quot;         adult. Brancusi's identity as a &quot;peasant&quot; as well as a &quot;child&quot;         thus served to position him on the outside of modern society. </font>      <p> <font class="second">Brancusi was frequently viewed not only as an outsider         to society, but also to the Parisian avant-garde circle. Having been described         in the 1920s as not &quot;one of the Montparnasse gang,&quot;<small><sup>22</sup></small>         Brancusi's outsider status was thus confirmed. Equally telling is this         account by a visitor to Brancusi's studio: &quot;He was not in the least         annoyed by the intrusion, but was like the peasant who is glad of an excuse         to lay down his hoe or his ax&#133;He was not voluble nor even fluent         as so many of the modernists were, but seemed to be hunting for words&#133;wasting         none of them.&quot;<small><sup>23</sup></small> Unlike Picasso, whose         outsider status as a Spaniard was overlooked by the Parisian avant-garde         and their critics, Brancusi was, in essence, forced to go it alone. However,         each artist benefited from their relative position within the art world.         Picasso enjoyed tremendous success as he distinguished himself as one         of the avant-garde's leading members, whereas Brancusi exploited his outsider         status in order to differentiate his work from that of his contemporaries.         Brancusi seemed happy to be perceived as an outsider as he preferred not         to be identified with any particular art movement: </font>       <blockquote><font class="second">I am not Surrealist, Baroque, Cubist, nothing         of this kind. My new I comes from something very old.<small><sup>24</sup></small>         </font>        <p>         <font class="second">I do not follow what is happening in art movements.         When one finds his own direction, he is so busy there is no time.<small><sup>25</sup></small></font>        <p> <font class="second">Those who let themselves be tempted to follow           in the tracks of competition at the same time allow their creative forces           to degenerate.<small><sup>26</sup></small></font>      </blockquote>      <font class="second">Brancusi catered to people's notions of what a peasant       is like, &quot;representing something that people wanted artists to be.&quot;<small><sup>27</sup></small>       In doing so he created a personal identity that could be associated with       his work. People were much more likely to accept the polycultural references       in his sculpture once they understood his &quot;peasant&quot; personality.       Finnish architect Alvar Aalto perhaps summarized this view best when he       said that Brancusi's art defined &quot;the point of intersection between       Western and Eastern culture.&quot;<small><sup>28</sup></small> Brancusi       was viewed as being closer to the secrets of the universe because he came       from a more &quot;primitive,&quot; less &quot;modern&quot; world.</font>      <p> <font class="second">Brancusi also followed a ritual-like pattern of         production in his work, repeating forms and ideas over and over again.         This is illustrated in his several series of works such as his birds and         eggs. According to Mircea Eliade, serial production is &quot;a method         characteristic of above all folk and ethnographic arts, in which the exemplary         models must be indefinitely reworked and 'imitated'&quot; in order to         discover the sources of their spirituality.<small><sup>29</sup></small>         Another formal attribute of his work that reflects this sort of ritualistic         behavior is the brilliant and shiny finish on his bronzes, which required         extensive amounts of work at smoothing and polishing. He never allowed         any of his assistants to help in polishing, reserving this meditative         habit exclusively for himself.</font>      <p> <font class="second">Another aspect of Brancusi's work that has been         compared to Rumanian folk tradition is his interest in wood carving. Critics         cite the prevalence of wood carving traditions in Rumania, and make the         unmistakable connection between this and Brancusi's work. Brancusi had         been trained in Craiova and Bucharest in wood carving,<small><sup>30</sup></small>         so he certainly had some familiarly with the medium. Yet when Brancusi         arrived in Paris, he was working only in marble, stone, and bronze. In         1906, following an exhibition of wood sculptures by Gauguin, many of the         Parisian vanguard artists took up direct carving as a technique in their         works, including Picasso, D&eacute;rain and Matisse.<small><sup>31</sup></small>         Brancusi took up direct carving in 1907 following the examples of his         contemporaries, although it is significant that he began his foray into         direct carving in stone. He did not complete his first wooden sculpture         until 1913, when he realized <i>The First Step</i> (which, as Sidney Geist         perceptively has pointed out, was <i>Brancusi's</i> first step in wooden         sculpture).<small><sup>32</sup></small></font>      <p> <font class="second">The process through which Brancusi returned to         wood carving is essential to understanding the development of his style.         Brancusi only returned to wood carving at the time he began his Africanesque         sculptures. Once his consciousness was provoked by the African sculptures         and their implications, Brancusi began to add wood carving to his repertoire.         Brancusi's process of self-discovery, in which he learned to draw upon         the folk art techniques he learned in Rumania, grew out of contact with         the avant-garde, in which artists looked to &quot;primitive&quot; art         for a new visual language.<small><sup>33</sup></small> Aside from the         Africanesque pieces, he made wood models of other works which he then         executed in marble or bronze, as well as his famous wooden bases.</font>      <p> <font class="second">There are few direct references to Rumanian folklore         and tradition in Brancusi's work, making a formal analysis difficult.         In fact, Brancusi only made one such sculpture, <i>Ma&#239;stra</i> (fig.         4), <small><sup>34</sup></small> one of his earliest sculptures. According         to Rumanian folklore, the <i>Pasarea Ma&#239;stra</i> is a mythological         bird figure that is a princess in disguise. The <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>, as         it goes, sings a song so beautiful that it can resurrect the dead, with         its other major quality being the beauty of its feathers, which shine         &quot;like a mirror in the sun.&quot;<small><sup>35</sup></small> With         Brancusi's <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>'s upwardly directed open mouth and brilliantly         polished finish, Brancusi captured each of these two essential qualities.         Furthermore, the image of the <i>Ma&#239;astra</i> seems to have occupied         a prominent role in Brancusi's imagination: Barbu Brezianu notes that         Brancusi, in listening to a Rumanian folk singer, exclaimed &quot;Maria!         I could carve for every song of ours a <i>Pasarea Ma&#239;astra</i>!&quot;<small><sup>36</sup></small>         In these ways one can argue convincingly that <i>Ma&#239;stra</i> relates         to Rumanian folklore. <i>Ma&#239;astra</i> also was the first bird sculpture         Brancusi attempted, after which followed a lifelong pursuit of a series         of bird forms: <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>, <i>Three Penguins</i>, <i>Yellow         Bird</i>, <i>Golden Bird</i>, and the iconic <i>Bird in Space</i>. <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>         also was one of his first sculptures endowed with the characteristic high         polish. </font>      <p> <font class="second">It is important to note, however, that the golden         (or solar) bird is seen in many mythologies around the world, from China         to Russia, from the Phoenix to Horus of ancient Egypt.<small><sup>37</sup></small>         Furthermore, many of the solar birds have beautiful songs that rejuvenate         and resurrect as well, including the Phoenix and the Chinese <i>Feng-huang</i>.<small><sup>38</sup></small>         In fact, there are so many similarities between the <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>         and other mythological bird-gods that many viewers from divergent backgrounds         are able to understand the essential meaning of the sculpture without         explanation. For although the reference to the <i>Ma&#239;stra</i> of         Rumanian folklore seems obscure, Brancusi, in choosing to represent this         mythological bird, touches upon ideas and associations that are widely         understood and speak to a more general audience. This, in its essence,         is what Brancusi strove for in his work. </font>      <p> <font class="second">One of Brancusi's works that has been identified         as echoing the forms of Rumanian folk art is his Endless Column. This         is Brancusi's final column, built as part of a World War I monument to         Rumanian soldiers in Tirgu Jiu. The <i>Endless Column</i> was a motif         that Brancusi had worked on for years, starting as a wooden sculptural         base and eventually being transformed into a monumental sculpture in its         own right. </font>      <p> <font class="second">When asked what the purpose of the <i>Endless Column</i>         was, Brancusi replied that it was &quot;to support the vault of heaven.&quot;<small><sup>39</sup></small>         Mircea Eliade notes that this description of the <i>Endless Column</i>         matches that of a Rumanian folklore motif, the &quot;pillar of the sky,&quot;         which is itself an extension of a mythological theme shown to exist since         prehistory. The &quot;pillar of the sky&quot; is an axis mundi, of which         numerous variants are known: The <i>axis mundi</i> supports the sky and         is the means of communication with the earth.<small><sup>40</sup></small></font>      <p> <font class="second">Formally, the repeating rhomboidal elements of         the <i>Endless Column</i> seem to elicit a feeling of ascension, particularly         the feeling that one could climb the Column as one would a tree.<small><sup>41</sup></small>         Ascension to the heavens is something Brancusi had become preoccupied         with, in the form of flight, in his <i>Bird in Space</i>. Brancusi once         exclaimed: &quot;All my life I have only sought the essence of flight.         Flight! what bliss!&quot;<small><sup>42</sup></small> Given that it is         a monument to the soldiers killed in WWI, the <i>Endless Column</i>'s         form seems germane to its symbolic evocation of ascension to the heavens.</font>      <p> <font class="second">One author has attempted to connect the shape of         the <i>Endless Column</i> with the forms of Oltenian porch pillars and         cemetery death poles.<small><sup>43</sup></small> The argument follows         that the monolithic and solemn qualities of the death poles may have inspired         Brancusi in the search for his column's form, especially in considering         the commemorative nature of the Tirgu-Jiu monument. It is more likely,         however, that the <i>Endless Column</i> is simply an extension of the         form that Brancusi had conceived for the column years earlier, when he         employed its form as a sculptural base.<small><sup>44</sup></small> It         is also unlikely<small><sup>45</sup></small> that Brancusi had the death         poles in mind when he originally conceived the form of the <i>Endless         Column</i>.<small><sup>46</sup></small> Rather, Brancusi seems to have         been preoccupied with the ideas of both ascension to, and support of,         the heavens. As a sculpture in its own right, the <i>Endless Column</i>         serves symbolically to support of the heavens and elevate the spirit,         while as a base the <i>Endless Column</i> can be seen as projecting the         sculpture upon it into space, in addition to serving its function as a         support. </font>      <p> <font class="second">As with <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>, what makes the <i>Endless         Column</i> so compelling is that it is representative of the mythological         and spiritual beliefs of a great number of cultures. The sculpture's simple         form conveys a meaning that is accessible to all. The <i>Endless Column</i>         has therefore elicited a wide range of critical interpretation: Its serrated         motif has been identified as &quot;strikingly&quot; African,<small><sup>47</sup></small>         and has, more fancifully, been related to the &quot;liturgical recitative         of Gregorian Chant.&quot;<small><sup>48</sup></small> It has also been         likened to the Hindu myth of the Lingam.<small><sup>49</sup></small> There         are many other such comparisons.</font>      <p> <font class="second">As seen in the two cases considered here (<i>Ma&#239;astra</i>         and <i>Endless Column</i>) critics have struggled to identify exclusively         Rumanian sources of influence in Brancusi's work. This is due to the fact         that the symbols Brancusi chose to employ in his art are somewhat ambiguous,         and thus speak to a wider, more general audience. While it is interesting         to explore the possible culturally derived sources in his work, it ultimately         proves to be somewhat futile, as the artist's intention was to embody         a timeless and universal sense of mysteriousness and of the sacred. He         attempted to dissuade viewers from looking for non-western formal influences         in his work: &quot;Do not look for obscure formulas or mysteries. I give         you pure joy. Look at my works until you see them. Those that are closest         to God have seen them.&quot;<small><sup>50</sup></small> Further evidence         of Brancusi's desire to avoid comparison with non-traditional western         sculptural traditions - including Rumanian folk art - is supported by         a statement he offered for a 1925 Paris exhibition to which he contributed         several works, in which he described his nationality as &quot;Terrestrial,         human, white species.&quot;<small><sup>51</sup></small> Brancusi's goal         was to produce a body of work that, although it would draw upon ideas         and forms from spiritually oriented sculptural traditions, would speak         universally about his own inner convictions. Because of this, one needs         ultimately to understand his Rumanian heritage metaphorically rather than         literally, owing it to the &quot;artist's state of mind&quot;<small><sup>52</sup></small>         that he endeavored to enrich his visual lexicon with formal concepts that         helped him express his spiritual views in a universal formal language.</font>       <p><font class="second"><b>References:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">1.
