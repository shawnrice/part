The statue depicted a female with her right arm raised               holding an olive branch and her left arm holding a shield inscribed               with the phrase &quot;<i>E pluribus unum</i>&quot; - Latin for &quot;out               of many, one.&quot;<small><sup>1</sup></small> Commissioned in 1921,               the sculpture was designed as a war memorial to commemorate the               young soldiers of the neighborhood who had sacrificed their lives               defending the country during World War I. No stranger to vandalism,               the bronze plaques which once accompanied the statue, containing               the names of the Brooklyn military personnel killed, were stolen               in 1974; but final defeat came, under darkness, in the early morning               hours of April 21, 2000, when thieves using a blow torch ruthlessly               removed the 1,000 pound statue from its 10-foot-wide base.<small><sup>2</sup></small></font></P>            <P><font class="second">Two career criminals were soon apprehended,               but unfortunately not before the sculpture had been chopped up and               its parts sold as scrap metal. Detectives were able to recover the               head of the sculpture and about 300 other pieces, in preparation               for being melted down. The seven-foot-tall figure of a woman would               have been worth only about $300.00 as scrap. The original price               of the statue was $5,500.00, and in today's market it would cost               more than $100,000.00 to replace.<small><sup>3</sup></small> <i>Victory</i>               was cast by Roman Bronze Works in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which produced               many turn-of-the-century bronze sculptures and monuments, including               some at Rockefeller Center, until it recently went out of business.<small><sup>4</sup></small>               </font></P>            <P><font class="second">But who was James Novelli? What can history               tell us about the man who designed this now lost sculpture? The               information which I uncovered both disturbed and intrigued me. I               was transported into a unique period of history, a time between               the great World Wars; a score of years filled with a multitude of               extremes: prosperity and depression, peace and anxiety, jubilation               and sorrow - in a similar manner these disparities would be echoed               in the life and work of the artist.</font></P>            <P><font class="second">James Novelli was an Italian-American born               in Sulmona, a province of Aquila, Italy, in 1885. When he was five,               his family immigrated to America and, like many Italian-Americans,               settled in New York City. While a young student at Public School               23 he would take chalk from the classroom blackboard and create               sidewalk drawings. Impressed by his skills and natural abilities,               both his parents and his teachers encouraged his artistic talents.               As a result, in 1903 when he was eighteen years old, he returned               to Italy and studied under Giulio Monteverde, Ettore Ferrari, and               Silvio Sbricoli.<small><sup>5</sup></small> While still a student               he won honorable mention at the International Exposition held in               Paris in 1906. He graduated from the Royal Academy of Rome in 1908.</font></P>            <P><font class="second">Upon Novelli's return to New York after his               graduation, it soon became apparent that he would be able to make               a good living in his chosen field of art. From the end of the Civil               War through the turn of the century there was an abundance of activity               and funds given toward public sculptural commissions. Having studied               with Monteverde, a master sculptor who obtained numerous commissions               for monuments celebrating national heroes and funerary memorials,<small><sup>6</sup></small>               Novelli was well trained and prepared to give the public what it               wanted. It wasn't long before he became recognized as a sculptor               and his reputation expanded beyond the New York area. An ample number               of lucrative commissions began coming in from cities throughout               the United States.</font></P>            <P><font class="second">By the end of World War I there was a renewed               nation-wide demand for memorials and monuments. The country was               heading into the 1920s and money was plentiful. As is always the               case in a prosperous economy, people had the money to indulge in               the luxury of the fine arts. A new class of people emerged; newly               famous celebrities, actors, and musicians, came to be regarded -               and regarded themselves - as figures important enough to warrant               portraits. At the same time there arose a large number of wealthy               patrons who could afford sculpture and who desired to embellish               the gardens on their private estates in a similar fashion to the               public parks. Novelli was an accomplished artist in this flourishing               market, with a promising future before him. In 1922 he was elected               to the membership of the National Sculpture Society, at a time when               the honorary president of the Society was Daniel Chester French.               The <i>Exhibition of American Sculpture Guide: April 14th -August               1st </i> of 1923 notes that he exhibited three of his works along               with the notable sculptor Frederick W. Mac Monnies, and from April               to October of 1929, Novelli exhibited in <i>Contemporary American               Sculpture: the California Palace of the Legion of Honor</i> at Lincoln               Park in San Francisco.</font></P>            <P><font class="second">Since its inception in the 1890s, and for               decades to follow, members of the National Sculpture Society were               the most important sculptors at work in the United States. It was               the aim of the National Sculpture Society to &quot;spread the knowledge               of good sculpture; ...and encourage the production of ideal sculpture               for the household and museums&quot;, and certainly to &quot;...promote               the decoration of public buildings, squares and parks with sculpture               of high class.&quot;<small><sup>7</sup></small> The Society provided               sculptors with the opportunity for work and the chance to establish               their reputations. Members consistently secured the best and richest               commissions available, and their works dominated public spaces throughout               the 1920s.<small><sup>8</sup></small> Novelli was also a member               of the Architectural League of New York. Even after the First World               War often a sculptor's livelihood depended on the favor of architects               for commissions. The goal of the Architectural League was to promote               the ideal of mutual enrichment through collaboration. Muralists,               sculptors and many other artists were invited to become members               and their annual exhibition included sections for landscape, architecture,               painting, sculpture and the decorative arts.<small><sup>9</sup></small>               With the exception of 1926, Novelli displayed his sculptural works               at the League's annual exhibitions from 1922 through 1928. At the               Thirty-Eighth Annual Exhibition, in 1923, a set of his bronze mausoleum               doors in Calvary Cemetery in New York won the Henry O. Avery Prize               for sculpture.<small><sup>10</sup></small></font></P>            <P><font class="second">As the pendulum swings, so does the American               economy, and the Great Depression was just waiting in the wings.               In 1930, Novelli was dropped from the membership of the National               Sculpture Society<small><sup>11</sup></small> and there was no reason               given on his membership card (present-day opinion holds that he               either simply let his dues expire or was not interested in renewing               his membership). Very little is mentioned about him or his works               after that date. He maintained his studio at 400 West Twenty-Third               Street in Manhattan through the lean years, but was forced to give               it up in 1939. Despondent over lack of new commissions and alarmed               about war conditions in Europe, Novelli took his own life at the               age of fifty-five on the afternoon of May 31, 1940. His wife Lillian               came home from work to find that the sculptor, alone in the apartment,               had hung himself with a clothesline thrown over the transom of a               bathroom door.<small><sup>12</sup></small> </font> </P>            <P><font class="second">Novelli lived at a time when a sculptor, unless               looked upon as famous, was often thought of as a craftsman, simply               a &quot;statue-maker&quot;. Professional sculptors referred to their               work as &quot;sculpture&quot;, whereas architects, politicians and               the general public mostly used the term &quot;statue&quot;. Yet,               it was also during this time that memorials and monuments were typically               dedicated with great pomp and ceremony. The events leading up to               the unveiling of the memorials were thoroughly planned and orchestrated,               and frequently covered by the press.</font></P>            <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="jmurph_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="mur2cont.jpg" width="131" height="175" border="0" alt="click to larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="jmurph_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">                     James Novelli, <i>Pershing Field Memorial</i>, 1922, bronze                     painted gold, 8 x 4 x 2 feet, on rock base.</font></a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <P><font class="second">Such was the case when in Jersey City Novelli's               memorial <i>America Triumphant</i> was unveiled at Pershing Field               in 1922, commemorating the 147 soldiers who died in the War. The               dedication ceremony took place on Independence Day, and a crowd               watched in awe as an airplane circled the crowd for two hours and               at timed intervals dropped a rose to the ground until 147, each               one representing one man who died, had made an immense bouquet at               the foot of the monument.<small><sup>13</sup></small> A major New               York newspaper covered the pageantry and reported the details of               the event along with the names of the dignitaries invited. However,               there is neither mention nor credit given to Novelli. His work was               treated merely as a purchase, something one buys and shows off with               no thought given to the originator.</font></P>            <P><font class="second">A similar scenario ensued with the unveiling               of his Saratoga Park Memorial, the Brooklyn <i>Victory</i>, on September               11, 1921. A short newspaper article stated that more than 2,000               persons witnessed the ceremony: a detachment of the Thirteenth Coast               Defense Command, the 106th Infantry Post, 244 Veterans of Foreign               Wars and principal speakers Senator Charles Lockwood, Borough President               Edward Riegelmann, Judge George Martin and District Attorney Harry               Lewis,<small><sup>14</sup></small> but once again no mention was               made of Novelli. One cannot help but wonder if Novelli was even               present at the ceremony, or how he felt about the press ignoring               his part in the creation of the monument. Long forgotten for over               sixty years, the artist and his works remained obscure until two               blundering thieves brought his name to life once more.</font> </P>            <P><font class="second">Some of Novelli's more successful works include               a group entitled <i>Motherhood</i> and another entitled <i>Rock               of Ages</i> (Durham, N.C.); sets of bronze doors for the Sigman               mausoleum and Judge Schmuck mausoleum, at Woodlawn Cemetery (New               York, N.Y.); and other funerary monuments including the Bigham mausoleum,               at Hawthorne, New York; La Gioia, and John Lordi mausoleums, at               Calvary Cemetery, (Queens, N.Y); <i>The Rowan Panel</i>, at Woodlawn               Cemetery, N.Y.; La Mattina-Guerriero, Calvary Cemetery, N.Y.; a               memorial for Art Smith, pioneer aviator, in Fort Wayne, Indiana;               a Columbus memorial at West Side Park, Jersey City, New Jersey;               and the MacSwegan memorial at Calvary Cemetery in Pittsburgh. Novelli               also produced various war memorials for Winfield, Queens; Bellows               Falls, Vermont, and Clason Point in the Bronx; and the <i>Thurman               Memorial</i> in Atlanta. Bronze portrait busts by Novelli exist               of President Warren G. Harding (in Marion, Ohio), Julius Berger,               Irving Green, Margaret Lawson, Anita Novarra, Peter Anderson, and               portraits of his father and grandmother. Finally, Novelli also produced               a number of portrait reliefs, most notably of James Cardinal Gibbons               (Catholic University, Washington, D.C.), Charlotte Brainard, Charles               G. Brainard, Dorothy Langley, Dora Ford, Francis P. De Luna, and               William B. Drake, and a Madonna and child, now in a private collection               in South Norwalk, Conneticut.<small><sup>15</sup></small> </font></P>            <P><font class="second">The Gilded Age, that dynamic epoch between               the end of the Civil War and just prior to World War I, was an extremely               productive era for the advancement of American sculpture. The success               of the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876 inspired similar               commemorative events in other cities. These many extravagant expositions               were paramount in contributing to the public's awareness of sculpture               as an art form, and the demand for sculptural commissions was occurring               at an unprecedented rate. Novelli, no different than any other young               artist who was eager to make a name for himself, was caught up in               this frenzy. The perpetuation of this plentiful and lucrative art               market convinced an extraordinarily large number of young artists               to channel their talents toward sculpture. This trend continued               throughout the early decades of the twentieth century until the               number of sculptors escalated to an unparalleled proportion.</font></P>            <P><font class="second">In retrospect, it was an exuberant economic               period that in actuality could not be sustained indefinitely. Novelli               was but one victim of this inflated interval of sculptural history               -- unfortunately, he was not alone. There were many, many more sculptors               active during that era who must have suffered similar adversities               as Novelli, but whose stories will probably never be told.</font></P>              <p><font class="second">If there were a need to judge the achievements of these men,                 some people would say that their success should be measured by                 their fame and fortune. I prefer to consider the ideas of Ralph                 Waldo Emerson who wrote, &quot;... to appreciate beauty; to find                 the best in others; to give of one's self; to leave the world                 a bit better ... this is to have succeeded.&quot;</font></p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="jmurph_ref.html">References&gt;&gt;</a></font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="jmurph_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font>           </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Josephine Murphy.
