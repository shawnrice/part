The         statue depicted a female with her right arm raised holding an olive branch         and her left arm holding a shield inscribed with the phrase &quot;<i>E         pluribus unum</i>&quot; - Latin for &quot;out of many, one.&quot;<small><sup>1</sup></small>         Commissioned in 1921, the sculpture was designed as a war memorial to         commemorate the young soldiers of the neighborhood who had sacrificed         their lives defending the country during World War I. No stranger to vandalism,         the bronze plaques which once accompanied the statue, containing the names         of the Brooklyn military personnel killed, were stolen in 1974; but final         defeat came, under darkness, in the early morning hours of April 21, 2000,         when thieves using a blow torch ruthlessly removed the 1,000 pound statue         from its 10-foot-wide base.<small><sup>2</sup></small></font></p>      <p><font class="second">Two career criminals were soon apprehended, but         unfortunately not before the sculpture had been chopped up and its parts         sold as scrap metal. Detectives were able to recover the head of the sculpture         and about 300 other pieces, in preparation for being melted down. The         seven-foot-tall figure of a woman would have been worth only about $300.00         as scrap. The original price of the statue was $5,500.00, and in today's         market it would cost more than $100,000.00 to replace.<small><sup>3</sup></small>         <i>Victory</i> was cast by Roman Bronze Works in Greenpoint, Brooklyn,         which produced many turn-of-the-century bronze sculptures and monuments,         including some at Rockefeller Center, until it recently went out of business.<small><sup>4</sup></small>         </font></p>      <p><font class="second">But who was James Novelli? What can history tell         us about the man who designed this now lost sculpture? The information         which I uncovered both disturbed and intrigued me. I was transported into         a unique period of history, a time between the great World Wars; a score         of years filled with a multitude of extremes: prosperity and depression,         peace and anxiety, jubilation and sorrow - in a similar manner these disparities         would be echoed in the life and work of the artist.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">James Novelli was an Italian-American born in Sulmona,         a province of Aquila, Italy, in 1885. When he was five, his family immigrated         to America and, like many Italian-Americans, settled in New York City.         While a young student at Public School 23 he would take chalk from the         classroom blackboard and create sidewalk drawings. Impressed by his skills         and natural abilities, both his parents and his teachers encouraged his         artistic talents. As a result, in 1903 when he was eighteen years old,         he returned to Italy and studied under Giulio Monteverde, Ettore Ferrari,         and Silvio Sbricoli.<small><sup>5</sup></small> While still a student         he won honorable mention at the International Exposition held in Paris         in 1906. He graduated from the Royal Academy of Rome in 1908.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">Upon Novelli's return to New York after his graduation,         it soon became apparent that he would be able to make a good living in         his chosen field of art. From the end of the Civil War through the turn         of the century there was an abundance of activity and funds given toward         public sculptural commissions. Having studied with Monteverde, a master         sculptor who obtained numerous commissions for monuments celebrating national         heroes and funerary memorials,<small><sup>6</sup></small> Novelli was         well trained and prepared to give the public what it wanted. It wasn't         long before he became recognized as a sculptor and his reputation expanded         beyond the New York area. An ample number of lucrative commissions began         coming in from cities throughout the United States.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">By the end of World War I there was a renewed nation-wide         demand for memorials and monuments. The country was heading into the 1920s         and money was plentiful. As is always the case in a prosperous economy,         people had the money to indulge in the luxury of the fine arts. A new         class of people emerged; newly famous celebrities, actors, and musicians,         came to be regarded - and regarded themselves - as figures important enough         to warrant portraits. At the same time there arose a large number of wealthy         patrons who could afford sculpture and who desired to embellish the gardens         on their private estates in a similar fashion to the public parks. Novelli         was an accomplished artist in this flourishing market, with a promising         future before him. In 1922 he was elected to the membership of the National         Sculpture Society, at a time when the honorary president of the Society         was Daniel Chester French. The <i>Exhibition of American Sculpture Guide:         April 14th -August 1st </i> of 1923 notes that he exhibited three of his         works along with the notable sculptor Frederick W. Mac Monnies, and from         April to October of 1929, Novelli exhibited in <i>Contemporary American         Sculpture: the California Palace of the Legion of Honor</i> at Lincoln         Park in San Francisco.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">Since its inception in the 1890s, and for decades         to follow, members of the National Sculpture Society were the most important         sculptors at work in the United States. It was the aim of the National         Sculpture Society to &quot;spread the knowledge of good sculpture; ...and         encourage the production of ideal sculpture for the household and museums&quot;,         and certainly to &quot;...promote the decoration of public buildings,         squares and parks with sculpture of high class.&quot;<small><sup>7</sup></small>         The Society provided sculptors with the opportunity for work and the chance         to establish their reputations. Members consistently secured the best         and richest commissions available, and their works dominated public spaces         throughout the 1920s.<small><sup>8</sup></small> Novelli was also a member         of the Architectural League of New York. Even after the First World War         often a sculptor's livelihood depended on the favor of architects for         commissions. The goal of the Architectural League was to promote the ideal         of mutual enrichment through collaboration. Muralists, sculptors and many         other artists were invited to become members and their annual exhibition         included sections for landscape, architecture, painting, sculpture and         the decorative arts.<small><sup>9</sup></small> With the exception of         1926, Novelli displayed his sculptural works at the League's annual exhibitions         from 1922 through 1928. At the Thirty-Eighth Annual Exhibition, in 1923,         a set of his bronze mausoleum doors in Calvary Cemetery in New York won         the Henry O. Avery Prize for sculpture.<small><sup>10</sup></small></font></p>      <p><font class="second">As the pendulum swings, so does the American economy,         and the Great Depression was just waiting in the wings. In 1930, Novelli         was dropped from the membership of the National Sculpture Society<small><sup>11</sup></small>         and there was no reason given on his membership card (present-day opinion         holds that he either simply let his dues expire or was not interested         in renewing his membership). Very little is mentioned about him or his         works after that date. He maintained his studio at 400 West Twenty-Third         Street in Manhattan through the lean years, but was forced to give it         up in 1939. Despondent over lack of new commissions and alarmed about         war conditions in Europe, Novelli took his own life at the age of fifty-five         on the afternoon of May 31, 1940. His wife Lillian came home from work         to find that the sculptor, alone in the apartment, had hung himself with         a clothesline thrown over the transom of a bathroom door.<small><sup>12</sup></small>         </font> </p>      <p><font class="second">Novelli lived at a time when a sculptor, unless         looked upon as famous, was often thought of as a craftsman, simply a &quot;statue-maker&quot;.         Professional sculptors referred to their work as &quot;sculpture&quot;,         whereas architects, politicians and the general public mostly used the         term &quot;statue&quot;. Yet, it was also during this time that memorials         and monuments were typically dedicated with great pomp and ceremony. The         events leading up to the unveiling of the memorials were thoroughly planned         and orchestrated, and frequently covered by the press.</font></p>      <table width="131" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="jmurph_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="mur2cont.jpg" width="131" height="175" border="0" alt="click to larger view"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="jmurph_2.html" target="_blank"><font class="sixth">               James Novelli, <i>Pershing Field Memorial</i>, 1922, bronze painted               gold, 8 x 4 x 2 feet, on rock base.</font></a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font class="second">Such was the case when in Jersey City Novelli's         memorial <i>America Triumphant</i> was unveiled at Pershing Field in 1922,         commemorating the 147 soldiers who died in the War. The dedication ceremony         took place on Independence Day, and a crowd watched in awe as an airplane         circled the crowd for two hours and at timed intervals dropped a rose         to the ground until 147, each one representing one man who died, had made         an immense bouquet at the foot of the monument.<small><sup>13</sup></small>         A major New York newspaper covered the pageantry and reported the details         of the event along with the names of the dignitaries invited. However,         there is neither mention nor credit given to Novelli. His work was treated         merely as a purchase, something one buys and shows off with no thought         given to the originator.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">A similar scenario ensued with the unveiling of         his Saratoga Park Memorial, the Brooklyn <i>Victory</i>, on September         11, 1921. A short newspaper article stated that more than 2,000 persons         witnessed the ceremony: a detachment of the Thirteenth Coast Defense Command,         the 106th Infantry Post, 244 Veterans of Foreign Wars and principal speakers         Senator Charles Lockwood, Borough President Edward Riegelmann, Judge George         Martin and District Attorney Harry Lewis,<small><sup>14</sup></small>         but once again no mention was made of Novelli. One cannot help but wonder         if Novelli was even present at the ceremony, or how he felt about the         press ignoring his part in the creation of the monument. Long forgotten         for over sixty years, the artist and his works remained obscure until         two blundering thieves brought his name to life once more.</font> </p>      <p><font class="second">Some of Novelli's more successful works include         a group entitled <i>Motherhood</i> and another entitled <i>Rock of Ages</i>         (Durham, N.C.); sets of bronze doors for the Sigman mausoleum and Judge         Schmuck mausoleum, at Woodlawn Cemetery (New York, N.Y.); and other funerary         monuments including the Bigham mausoleum, at Hawthorne, New York; La Gioia,         and John Lordi mausoleums, at Calvary Cemetery, (Queens, N.Y); <i>The         Rowan Panel</i>, at Woodlawn Cemetery, N.Y.; La Mattina-Guerriero, Calvary         Cemetery, N.Y.; a memorial for Art Smith, pioneer aviator, in Fort Wayne,         Indiana; a Columbus memorial at West Side Park, Jersey City, New Jersey;         and the MacSwegan memorial at Calvary Cemetery in Pittsburgh. Novelli         also produced various war memorials for Winfield, Queens; Bellows Falls,         Vermont, and Clason Point in the Bronx; and the <i>Thurman Memorial</i>         in Atlanta. Bronze portrait busts by Novelli exist of President Warren         G. Harding (in Marion, Ohio), Julius Berger, Irving Green, Margaret Lawson,         Anita Novarra, Peter Anderson, and portraits of his father and grandmother.         Finally, Novelli also produced a number of portrait reliefs, most notably         of James Cardinal Gibbons (Catholic University, Washington, D.C.), Charlotte         Brainard, Charles G. Brainard, Dorothy Langley, Dora Ford, Francis P.         De Luna, and William B. Drake, and a Madonna and child, now in a private         collection in South Norwalk, Conneticut.<small><sup>15</sup></small> </font></p>      <p><font class="second">The Gilded Age, that dynamic epoch between the end         of the Civil War and just prior to World War I, was an extremely productive         era for the advancement of American sculpture. The success of the Philadelphia         Centennial Exposition of 1876 inspired similar commemorative events in         other cities. These many extravagant expositions were paramount in contributing         to the public's awareness of sculpture as an art form, and the demand         for sculptural commissions was occurring at an unprecedented rate. Novelli,         no different than any other young artist who was eager to make a name         for himself, was caught up in this frenzy. The perpetuation of this plentiful         and lucrative art market convinced an extraordinarily large number of         young artists to channel their talents toward sculpture. This trend continued         throughout the early decades of the twentieth century until the number         of sculptors escalated to an unparalleled proportion.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">In retrospect, it was an exuberant economic period         that in actuality could not be sustained indefinitely. Novelli was but         one victim of this inflated interval of sculptural history -- unfortunately,         he was not alone. There were many, many more sculptors active during that         era who must have suffered similar adversities as Novelli, but whose stories         will probably never be told.</font></p>      <p><font class="second">If there were a need to judge the achievements of         these men, some people would say that their success should be measured         by their fame and fortune. I prefer to consider the ideas of Ralph Waldo         Emerson who wrote, &quot;... to appreciate beauty; to find the best in         others; to give of one's self; to leave the world a bit better ... this         is to have succeeded.&quot;</font></p>            <p><font class="second"><b>References:</b></font></p>      <p><font class="second">1.
