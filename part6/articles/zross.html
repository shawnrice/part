In his early               works Brancusi explored the sculptural styles of a variety of non-Western,               so-called &quot;primitive&quot; cultures. He followed a mimetic               sculptural process in an effort to draw himself closer to the implied               spiritual content of these traditional art forms. By doing so, Brancusi               hoped to construct a visual language capable of expressing his spiritual               views of the universe. As he probed various non-western sculptural               styles for meaningful symbolic representation, he either accepted               or rejected the forms based on the compatibility of each style's               implied spiritual content with his own views of the universe. By               1925, having entered the mature phase of his career, Brancusi had               assimilated a variety of formal influences and had joined them together               in a style that is at once unique and referential to the sculptural               traditions of other cultures.</font></P>            <p> <font class="second">Recent critics have sought to deconstruct               the individuality of Brancusi's sculptural style by analyzing the               formal similarities between his work and &quot;primitive&quot; art               forms or ideas: African tribal art, archaic art, Eastern religions               - particularly the writings of the Tibetan monk Milarepa - among               others. The readings of these similarities are then supported by               several types of evidence, including Brancusi's position within               the circle of Parisian avant-garde artists, evidence of his trips               to museums known for their &quot;primitive&quot; art collections,               quotes from the artist, other secondhand accounts, etc. Most Brancusi               scholars agree that each of the sources mentioned above have had               some influence upon his art; they each tend to acknowledge the work               of others while proceeding on with his/her own thesis.<small><sup>1</sup></small></font></p>            <font class="second">Brancusi's Rumanian heritage, however, is one             source of artistic inspiration that has elicited a disparate array             of responses. Critics have had a hard time accounting for the degree             to which Brancusi drew upon Rumanian folk traditions for inspiration             in his work. Some critics maintain that there is only slight evidence             of a link to these traditions, while others maintain that Brancusi's             ancestral origins provide the fundamental basis of his work. Although             the range of interpretations is wide and varied, the readings of Brancusi's             ties to Rumanian folklore occupies a central position in the critical             discourse on Brancusi, serving as the major point of distinction among             scholars. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">The search for Rumanian sources in Brancusi's             art is a complicated matter. The reasons for this are several: There             are few direct references to Rumanian folklore in his art (only one             sculpture, <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>, has a Rumanian title), and the formal             elements of his work that have been identified as Rumanian in nature             also resemble images and concepts from a variety of other cultures             and religions. Clouding the issue is the fact that Brancusi actively             promoted an identity of himself as a Rumanian peasant tied to the             ancestral traditions of his homeland. This self-construction has tempted             critics to read in Rumanian sources in Brancusi's work despite the             scant evidence of direct ties between his art and folk art traditions             of his homeland. This has led to the reception of Brancusi as a sagely             peasant living in Paris, an outsider to the trends of modernity sweeping             across the city. This essay attempts to define the central role that             Brancusi's self-construction has played in influencing the readings             of his work. It then relates this discussion of identity to two works             by Brancusi that critics have put forth as evidence of links between             his style and visual motifs from Rumanian folk art, the <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>             and the <i>Endless Column</i>. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">Brancusi was born in a rural region of Rumania             known as Oltenia, in the town of Hobitza. His parents were peasants             and small landholders. Around 1887, at which point Brancusi would             have been the age of 11, <small><sup>2</sup></small> he ran away from             home to Tirgu Jiu, where he later erected his only public monument.             There he stayed until 1892, when he went to Craiova. Three years later,             at the age of 22, he graduated with honors from the Craiova School             of Arts and Crafts. He received a grant and went to Bucharest to study             at the School of Fine Arts for three more years, where he distinguished             himself and won many awards. In 1904, he left for Paris, most of the             way on foot, and he remained there, with the exception of a few short             trips, for the rest of his life. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">In 1907, Brancusi became an assistant in Rodin's             studio. At the time, Rodin's studio was a bustling production line,             with approximately 50 assistants working under the great sculptor.             Brancusi worked there only one month. <small><sup>3</sup></small>             When asked later as to why he left, Brancusi responded with one of             his typical aphorisms: &quot;Nothing grows in the shadow of great             trees.&quot; After leaving Rodin, Brancusi changed his sculptural             style completely. He eschewed Rodin's sensual and dramatic aesthetic             in favor of new, minimalistic forms. He dropped the traditional modeling             techniques and moved to direct carving as he began exploring a new,             wholly distinctive sculptural style. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">Many scholars have sought to deconstruct Brancusi's             style by locating exact sources of formal influence. Most of these             efforts have surrounded the influence of so-called &quot;primitive&quot;             sculptural styles, that is, sculpture from outside the Western academic             tradition. These investigations have revealed a variety of such sources             of artistic inspiration. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">What must be understood before a formal analysis             of the connection between Brancusi's art and these &quot;primitive&quot;             sculptural traditions can be undertaken is that, from the very beginning,             the critical reception of Brancusi's art has been shaped by the perception             of his Rumanian heritage. It has been noted that Brancusi's art &quot;betrays             the grafting of a <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> Paris onto the mystic             and rough trunk of folkloric Rumania.&quot;<small><sup>4</sup></small>             This type of analysis has tended to work in Brancusi's favor, for             his &quot;peasant&quot; identity oftentimes placed him, by the hands             of the critics, closer to the essential qualities of &quot;primitive&quot;             arts, and thus above reproach for appropriating &quot;primitive&quot;             styles. In this vein, he has been described as &quot;like a forest             creature&quot;<small><sup>6</sup></small> and as &quot;half god, half             faun.&quot;<small><sup>6</sup></small> As Claire Guilbert said in             1957 about Brancusi, while other artists of the Parisian avant-garde             &quot;submitted to the influence of negro masks and primitive arts,             this Rumanian peasant, who is a real primitive, found himself on an             even footing with them.&quot;<small><sup>7</sup></small> Analyses             such as these serve to subjugate the influences of ideas from other             cultures to those of Rumania, in effect classifying them as secondary             and derivative. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">Brancusi's Rumanian heritage has also functioned             in a seemingly opposite fashion. A contemporary account of his work             from the 1930s maintained that &quot;instead of examining the negroes             like the cubists had done Brancusi simply recalled the memories of             his childhood, the immaculate whiteness of Rumanian churches perhaps,             the purity of their marvellously [<i>sic</i>] free and outlandish             style, where Byzantine, Roman and Gothic dispute their titles and             positions with folklore.&quot; <small><sup>8</sup></small> This is             interesting in that although Brancusi's Rumanian heritage is used             here to repudiate the influence of African art on his work (which             irrefutably had an impact on Brancusi<small><sup>9</sup></small>),             Brancusi's heritage is again offered as a spiritually &quot;pure&quot;             source of stylistic inspiration. Another more recent critic elevates             Brancusi's status as an outsider to Western sculptural tradition to             a fundamental position in 20th-century art by positing that sculpture             &quot;needed the detachment of a sculptor brought up <i>in an alien             tradition</i> to move beyond the accomplishments of Rodin.&quot;<small><sup>10</sup></small>             The contexts in which his ancestry has been invoked both during his             lifetime and up to the present are too many to number. </font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">Brancusi's Rumanian heritage thus serves as a             frequent point of departure for all subsequent formal analyses of             his work. One cannot undertake any study of Brancusi's sculpture without             addressing the question of his origins. Brancusi himself encouraged             his audience to make this assumption: &quot;My laws are those of Craiova             where I spent the decisive years of my youth.&quot;<small><sup>11</sup></small>             Indeed, the major reason critics have looked to Rumanian folk traditions             for sources of influence in Brancusi's sculpture is due to the artist's             own efforts to portray himself publicly as a Rumanian peasant. Brancusi             kept his studio in the fashion of a peasant's home. He often wore             peasant's clothing, even to formal occasions.<small><sup>12</sup></small>             He carved all of his own furniture, including the stove. He treated             his sculptures as his family - he's even said to have wept at the             sale of one of his works.<small><sup>13</sup></small> But most of             all, Brancusi promoted himself as a peasant by speaking in colorful             aphorisms, in essence promoting a popular idea of &quot;peasant wisdom.&quot;<small><sup>14</sup></small></font>            <p></p>            <font class="second">Many of these aphorisms refer to his life as             a Rumanian:</font>             <blockquote><font class="second">In my native village in the Carpathians               life was happy, without quarrels and illnesses; this was because               the civilization that spoils everything had not yet arrived.<small><sup>15</sup></small></font>              <p>               <font class="second">From the plenitude of my sunny province, I               built a reserve of joy for my entire life; only in this way was               I able to resist.<small><sup>16</sup></small></font>              <p> <font class="second">Life was happy, without quarrels or sicknesses,                 because the civilization that makes things false had never come                 there.<small><sup>17</sup></small> </font>            </blockquote>            <font class="second">These quotes are interesting because, even though             he ran away from home at a very early age, and left for Paris once             he had the chance, as he grew older, Brancusi felt a need to idealize             those traditions as part of his self-fashioning.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Brancusi's self-portrayal as a peasant had               a predictable effect on his critics: &quot;Wearing white pajamas               and a yellow, gnomelike cap, Brancusi today &#133;leads the same               humble life he led as a peasant boy in Rumania before the turn of               the century,&quot;<small><sup>18</sup></small> and it was presumably               there that &quot;he began his lifelong quest for forms which would               convey the essence of things.&quot;<small><sup>19</sup></small>               This type of reductive comparison to a child was espoused on many               occasions, with critics describing his art as portraying &quot;a               universe seen with childlike innocence and rendered with archaic               simplicity.&quot;<small><sup>20</sup></small> Brancusi reinforced               this perception by maintaining that &quot;when we are no longer               children, we are already dead.&quot;<small><sup>21</sup></small>               Under this construction, Brancusi's &quot;childlike&quot; vision               gave him access to a formal language beyond the limits of the &quot;modern&quot;               adult. Brancusi's identity as a &quot;peasant&quot; as well as a               &quot;child&quot; thus served to position him on the outside of               modern society. </font>            <p> <font class="second">Brancusi was frequently viewed not only as               an outsider to society, but also to the Parisian avant-garde circle.               Having been described in the 1920s as not &quot;one of the Montparnasse               gang,&quot;<small><sup>22</sup></small> Brancusi's outsider status               was thus confirmed. Equally telling is this account by a visitor               to Brancusi's studio: &quot;He was not in the least annoyed by the               intrusion, but was like the peasant who is glad of an excuse to               lay down his hoe or his ax&#133;He was not voluble nor even fluent               as so many of the modernists were, but seemed to be hunting for               words&#133;wasting none of them.&quot;<small><sup>23</sup></small>               Unlike Picasso, whose outsider status as a Spaniard was overlooked               by the Parisian avant-garde and their critics, Brancusi was, in               essence, forced to go it alone. However, each artist benefited from               their relative position within the art world. Picasso enjoyed tremendous               success as he distinguished himself as one of the avant-garde's               leading members, whereas Brancusi exploited his outsider status               in order to differentiate his work from that of his contemporaries.               Brancusi seemed happy to be perceived as an outsider as he preferred               not to be identified with any particular art movement: </font>             <blockquote><font class="second">I am not Surrealist, Baroque, Cubist,               nothing of this kind. My new I comes from something very old.<small><sup>24</sup></small>               </font>              <p>               <font class="second">I do not follow what is happening in art movements.               When one finds his own direction, he is so busy there is no time.<small><sup>25</sup></small></font>              <p> <font class="second">Those who let themselves be tempted to                 follow in the tracks of competition at the same time allow their                 creative forces to degenerate.<small><sup>26</sup></small></font>            </blockquote>            <font class="second">Brancusi catered to people's notions of what             a peasant is like, &quot;representing something that people wanted             artists to be.&quot;<small><sup>27</sup></small> In doing so he created             a personal identity that could be associated with his work. People             were much more likely to accept the polycultural references in his             sculpture once they understood his &quot;peasant&quot; personality.             Finnish architect Alvar Aalto perhaps summarized this view best when             he said that Brancusi's art defined &quot;the point of intersection             between Western and Eastern culture.&quot;<small><sup>28</sup></small>             Brancusi was viewed as being closer to the secrets of the universe             because he came from a more &quot;primitive,&quot; less &quot;modern&quot;             world.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Brancusi also followed a ritual-like pattern               of production in his work, repeating forms and ideas over and over               again. This is illustrated in his several series of works such as               his birds and eggs. According to Mircea Eliade, serial production               is &quot;a method characteristic of above all folk and ethnographic               arts, in which the exemplary models must be indefinitely reworked               and 'imitated'&quot; in order to discover the sources of their spirituality.<small><sup>29</sup></small>               Another formal attribute of his work that reflects this sort of               ritualistic behavior is the brilliant and shiny finish on his bronzes,               which required extensive amounts of work at smoothing and polishing.               He never allowed any of his assistants to help in polishing, reserving               this meditative habit exclusively for himself.</font>            <p> <font class="second">Another aspect of Brancusi's work that has               been compared to Rumanian folk tradition is his interest in wood               carving. Critics cite the prevalence of wood carving traditions               in Rumania, and make the unmistakable connection between this and               Brancusi's work. Brancusi had been trained in Craiova and Bucharest               in wood carving,<small><sup>30</sup></small> so he certainly had               some familiarly with the medium. Yet when Brancusi arrived in Paris,               he was working only in marble, stone, and bronze. In 1906, following               an exhibition of wood sculptures by Gauguin, many of the Parisian               vanguard artists took up direct carving as a technique in their               works, including Picasso, D&eacute;rain and Matisse.<small><sup>31</sup></small>               Brancusi took up direct carving in 1907 following the examples of               his contemporaries, although it is significant that he began his               foray into direct carving in stone. He did not complete his first               wooden sculpture until 1913, when he realized <i>The First Step</i>               (which, as Sidney Geist perceptively has pointed out, was <i>Brancusi's</i>               first step in wooden sculpture).<small><sup>32</sup></small></font>            <p> <font class="second">The process through which Brancusi returned               to wood carving is essential to understanding the development of               his style. Brancusi only returned to wood carving at the time he               began his Africanesque sculptures. Once his consciousness was provoked               by the African sculptures and their implications, Brancusi began               to add wood carving to his repertoire. Brancusi's process of self-discovery,               in which he learned to draw upon the folk art techniques he learned               in Rumania, grew out of contact with the avant-garde, in which artists               looked to &quot;primitive&quot; art for a new visual language.<small><sup>33</sup></small>               Aside from the Africanesque pieces, he made wood models of other               works which he then executed in marble or bronze, as well as his               famous wooden bases.</font>            <p> <font class="second">There are few direct references to Rumanian               folklore and tradition in Brancusi's work, making a formal analysis               difficult. In fact, Brancusi only made one such sculpture, <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>               (fig. 4), <small><sup>34</sup></small> one of his earliest sculptures.               According to Rumanian folklore, the <i>Pasarea Ma&#239;stra</i>               is a mythological bird figure that is a princess in disguise. The               <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>, as it goes, sings a song so beautiful that               it can resurrect the dead, with its other major quality being the               beauty of its feathers, which shine &quot;like a mirror in the sun.&quot;<small><sup>35</sup></small>               With Brancusi's <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>'s upwardly directed open mouth               and brilliantly polished finish, Brancusi captured each of these               two essential qualities. Furthermore, the image of the <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>               seems to have occupied a prominent role in Brancusi's imagination:               Barbu Brezianu notes that Brancusi, in listening to a Rumanian folk               singer, exclaimed &quot;Maria! I could carve for every song of ours               a <i>Pasarea Ma&#239;astra</i>!&quot;<small><sup>36</sup></small>               In these ways one can argue convincingly that <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>               relates to Rumanian folklore. <i>Ma&#239;astra</i> also was the               first bird sculpture Brancusi attempted, after which followed a               lifelong pursuit of a series of bird forms: <i>Ma&#239;astra</i>,               <i>Three Penguins</i>, <i>Yellow Bird</i>, <i>Golden Bird</i>, and               the iconic <i>Bird in Space</i>. <i>Ma&#239;astra</i> also was one               of his first sculptures endowed with the characteristic high polish.               </font>            <p> <font class="second">It is important to note, however, that the               golden (or solar) bird is seen in many mythologies around the world,               from China to Russia, from the Phoenix to Horus of ancient Egypt.<small><sup>37</sup></small>               Furthermore, many of the solar birds have beautiful songs that rejuvenate               and resurrect as well, including the Phoenix and the Chinese <i>Feng-huang</i>.<small><sup>38</sup></small>               In fact, there are so many similarities between the <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>               and other mythological bird-gods that many viewers from divergent               backgrounds are able to understand the essential meaning of the               sculpture without explanation. For although the reference to the               <i>Ma&#239;stra</i> of Rumanian folklore seems obscure, Brancusi,               in choosing to represent this mythological bird, touches upon ideas               and associations that are widely understood and speak to a more               general audience. This, in its essence, is what Brancusi strove               for in his work. </font>            <p> <font class="second">One of Brancusi's works that has been identified               as echoing the forms of Rumanian folk art is his Endless Column.               This is Brancusi's final column, built as part of a World War I               monument to Rumanian soldiers in Tirgu Jiu. The <i>Endless Column</i>               was a motif that Brancusi had worked on for years, starting as a               wooden sculptural base and eventually being transformed into a monumental               sculpture in its own right. </font>            <p> <font class="second">When asked what the purpose of the <i>Endless               Column</i> was, Brancusi replied that it was &quot;to support the               vault of heaven.&quot;<small><sup>39</sup></small> Mircea Eliade               notes that this description of the <i>Endless Column</i> matches               that of a Rumanian folklore motif, the &quot;pillar of the sky,&quot;               which is itself an extension of a mythological theme shown to exist               since prehistory. The &quot;pillar of the sky&quot; is an axis mundi,               of which numerous variants are known: The <i>axis mundi</i> supports               the sky and is the means of communication with the earth.<small><sup>40</sup></small></font>            <p> <font class="second">Formally, the repeating rhomboidal elements               of the <i>Endless Column</i> seem to elicit a feeling of ascension,               particularly the feeling that one could climb the Column as one               would a tree.<small><sup>41</sup></small> Ascension to the heavens               is something Brancusi had become preoccupied with, in the form of               flight, in his <i>Bird in Space</i>. Brancusi once exclaimed: &quot;All               my life I have only sought the essence of flight. Flight! what bliss!&quot;<small><sup>42</sup></small>               Given that it is a monument to the soldiers killed in WWI, the <i>Endless               Column</i>'s form seems germane to its symbolic evocation of ascension               to the heavens.</font>            <p> <font class="second">One author has attempted to connect the shape               of the <i>Endless Column</i> with the forms of Oltenian porch pillars               and cemetery death poles.<small><sup>43</sup></small> The argument               follows that the monolithic and solemn qualities of the death poles               may have inspired Brancusi in the search for his column's form,               especially in considering the commemorative nature of the Tirgu-Jiu               monument. It is more likely, however, that the <i>Endless Column</i>               is simply an extension of the form that Brancusi had conceived for               the column years earlier, when he employed its form as a sculptural               base.<small><sup>44</sup></small> It is also unlikely<small><sup>45</sup></small>               that Brancusi had the death poles in mind when he originally conceived               the form of the <i>Endless Column</i>.<small><sup>46</sup></small>               Rather, Brancusi seems to have been preoccupied with the ideas of               both ascension to, and support of, the heavens. As a sculpture in               its own right, the <i>Endless Column</i> serves symbolically to               support of the heavens and elevate the spirit, while as a base the               <i>Endless Column</i> can be seen as projecting the sculpture upon               it into space, in addition to serving its function as a support.               </font>            <p> <font class="second">As with <i>Ma&#239;stra</i>, what makes the               <i>Endless Column</i> so compelling is that it is representative               of the mythological and spiritual beliefs of a great number of cultures.               The sculpture's simple form conveys a meaning that is accessible               to all. The <i>Endless Column</i> has therefore elicited a wide               range of critical interpretation: Its serrated motif has been identified               as &quot;strikingly&quot; African,<small><sup>47</sup></small> and               has, more fancifully, been related to the &quot;liturgical recitative               of Gregorian Chant.&quot;<small><sup>48</sup></small> It has also               been likened to the Hindu myth of the Lingam.<small><sup>49</sup></small>               There are many other such comparisons.</font>            <p> <font class="second">As seen in the two cases considered here               (<i>Ma&#239;astra</i> and <i>Endless Column</i>) critics have struggled               to identify exclusively Rumanian sources of influence in Brancusi's               work. This is due to the fact that the symbols Brancusi chose to               employ in his art are somewhat ambiguous, and thus speak to a wider,               more general audience. While it is interesting to explore the possible               culturally derived sources in his work, it ultimately proves to               be somewhat futile, as the artist's intention was to embody a timeless               and universal sense of mysteriousness and of the sacred. He attempted               to dissuade viewers from looking for non-western formal influences               in his work: &quot;Do not look for obscure formulas or mysteries.               I give you pure joy. Look at my works until you see them. Those               that are closest to God have seen them.&quot;<small><sup>50</sup></small>               Further evidence of Brancusi's desire to avoid comparison with non-traditional               western sculptural traditions - including Rumanian folk art - is               supported by a statement he offered for a 1925 Paris exhibition               to which he contributed several works, in which he described his               nationality as &quot;Terrestrial, human, white species.&quot;<small><sup>51</sup></small>               Brancusi's goal was to produce a body of work that, although it               would draw upon ideas and forms from spiritually oriented sculptural               traditions, would speak universally about his own inner convictions.               Because of this, one needs ultimately to understand his Rumanian               heritage metaphorically rather than literally, owing it to the &quot;artist's               state of mind&quot;<small><sup>52</sup></small> that he endeavored               to enrich his visual lexicon with formal concepts that helped him               express his spiritual views in a universal formal language.</font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="zross_ref.html">References&gt;&gt;</a></font>             <p><font class="second"><a href="zross_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>              <br>              </font>           </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part and Zachary Ross.
