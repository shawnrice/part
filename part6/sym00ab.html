The first was               held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York between               April 25, 1998 and January 31, 1999 and was entitled <i>Spirits               in Steel: The Art of the Kalabari Masquerade</i>. This exhibit featured               sculptural works in steel by the Nigerian-born, London-based artist               Sokari Douglas Camp which were created in London but based upon               events related to the artist's African heritage, namely the masquerades               of the Kalabari people of Nigeria. Because of the location of this               exhibit, it must be considered in relation to the history of display               techniques which have been used within the &quot;natural history&quot;               museum context for objects from the African continent, ranging from               cabinets of curiosity to dioramas to the gallery-style presentation               of isolated objects. With this issue in mind, one might ask why               the work of a contemporary artist who is internationally recognized               as such would be shown in a &quot;natural history&quot; museum setting               that is typically associated with displays of specimens from the               plant and animal kingdoms? Furthermore, if these sculptures are               understood as examples of a &quot;culture,&quot; then of which is               Camp a representative? The Kalabari of Nigeria, the African Diaspora               artistic community in London, or some combination of groups? Why               was the American Museum of Natural History interested in mounting               such an exhibit: to expand the parameters of what is considered               appropriate subject matter for their museum or to create a modern               day &quot;diorama&quot; that employs contemporary artistic interpretations               of traditional African objects and activities? </font></p>            <p><font class="second">The second exhibit was <i>SENSATION: Young               British Artists from the Saatchi Collection</i>, held between October               2, 199 and January 9, 2000 at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. This show               included a work by Chris Ofili, a London-based artist of Nigerian               heritage, entitled <i>The Holy Virgin Mary</i>which received a great               deal of media coverage due, in part, to Mayor Giuliani's negative               reaction to the piece. Because the image includes balls of elephant               dung, a Virgin with dark skin and &quot;African&quot; facial features               and floating &quot;wings&quot; that were actually cut-outs of female               buttocks from sex magazines, Giuliani described it as offensive               to the Catholic religion and threatened to evict the museum. Ofili,               born of Yoruba-speaking Nigerian parents in Manchester, England,               was raised as an altar boy and considers himself a Catholic. His               work often explores issues of identity in relation to his African               heritage, the phenomenon of hero worship and popular culture, especially               &quot;blaxploitation&quot; images. Although it might initially seem               more possible to freely &quot;construct&quot; one's identity through               art in an &quot;art&quot; rather than &quot;natural history&quot;               venue, in this instance it was Ofili, rather than Camp, who encountered               more resistance. On the other hadn, it was also Ofili, rather than               Camp, who contributed a work which addresses the complexity of the               African Diaspora experience and the self-conscious nature of identity               construction.</font></p>            <font class="second"><b>Chlo&eacute; Georas<br>            <a href="mailto:bf20607@binghamton.edu">bf20607@binghamton.edu</a>             <br>            SUNY-Binghamton University <br>            &quot;Museums in a Tank: Re-Imperializations at the Mus&eacute;e des             arts d'Afrique et d'Oceanie&quot;</b></font><br>            <font class="second">My paper examines the changing locations of the             <i>Mus&eacute;e des arts d'Afrique et d'Oceanie</i> (Paris) in the             French social imaginary. Most of this museum's focus is on its history             as part of the Colonial Exhibition of 1931 where it emerged as the             <i>Muse&eacute; Permanent des Colonies</i>. However, I am concerned             with the transitions in the practices of representation of this museum             from the colonial to the post-colonial period. </font>             <p><font class="second">The Muse&eacute; Permanent des Colonies exalted               the <i>mission civilsatrice</i> of five centuries of French colonialism               such as the French expansion after the crusades, the &quot;exoticism&quot;               in French art and literature, and the purported economic and social               &quot;humanitarian&quot; role of France in the world. Once the struggles               for independence of France's colonial territories began, the museum's               change of to the <i>Mus&eacute;e des arts d'Afrique et d'Oceanie</i>,               became symptomatic of a necessary redefinition of their agenda.               The museum then attempted to recognize the different civilizations               and artistic production of the previously colonized territories               and their influence upon modern European art. Interestingly, many               of the proposed changes and renovations were never actually completed               and the collection still groups African and Asian art together which               is a clear legacy of the colonial administration of those regions.               However, what truly stands out in this respect is the relationship               of the aquarium of tropical fish in the basement to the art collections               upstairs. My paper will highlight the problematic conflations of               art an animal life that still epitomize the colonialist imagination               that gave rise to the museum in the first place.</font></p>            <p><font class="second">The museum exemplifies the process whereby               colonial institutions are transformed in an attempt to better engage               with the changing circumstances of the post-war era. It is a &quot;place               of memory&quot; that offers a microcosmic gaze of the global realignments               of France in the twentieth-century, above all marked by the loss               of the French empire. Yet, it is also a &quot;place of erasure&quot;               to the extend that its post-colonial mutations attempted to establish               a radical break with the past that twas never culminated, leaving               in its wake a half-hazard-decolonized museum. In this sense, the               museum materializes the problematic crux of colonial continuities               under post-colonial guises and a wider crisis of national identification               beyond an imperial subjectivity.</font></p>            <font class="second"><b>Thomas E.

Not in the pseudo-military,             end-of-the-world and/or civilization sense, nor as someone who has             persevered herself against a life of adversity and emerged the victor,             but as someone deeply committed to the continued existence of Native             Americans both physically and culturally. As a Native American photographer,             her work has continually been imbued with political statements about             Native identity and whose right it is to determine that identity.             </font>             <p><font class="second">During the 1980's, she began her career in               the San Francisco Bay area as a commercial photographer, doing promotional               materials for many of the Native American organizations in the area.               Encouraged by friends who are professional artists and curators,               she began to create photographic collages for the fine art field.               Many of her earlier images have centered on the contrasting images               of Native Americans in modern society: how they have been historically               portrayed as a &quot;vanishing race&quot; by Euro-Americans opposed               with the reality of Native American life an its continued existence               today. Her collaged images combine the romanticized historic images               of Native Americans and juxtapose them with her own images of contemporary               Native Americans to expose and then deconstruct false perceptions.               However, while these early works embraced the vitality of contemporary               Native life and were principally intended for Native viewers, the               audiences for the exhibitions she was now part of were predominantly               non-Native. Her sarcastic use of contemporary Native stereotypes               in juxtaposition with 'ethnographic' images often lead non-Natives               to misinterpret the images and thereby reinforce these stereotypes.               At the same time, certain nuances of her messages were reliant on               the intricacies of Native thought and culture which furthered the               misinterpretation of the image, or turned non-Native audiences away               from even trying to interpret them. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">More recently, her works have become more               direct and blunt in their messages, often for the benefit of the               non-Native audience. Tsinhnahjinnie has continued to collage photographic               elements, now digitally, but has streamlined the imagery for quick               recognition by non-Natives. She still uses 'ethnographic' and stereotyped               images, but now they are combined with historical images and photographs               from non-Native popular culture. This combination entices the viewer               with a ready sense of recognition, while Tsinhnahjinnie's humor               and sarcasm in the juxtaposition of the images quickly confront               the viewer with questions of identity, cultural survival, and sovereignty.               Once the viewer has been lulled into a sense of easy recognition,               Tsinhnahjinnie confronts them with an image so simple and straightforward               it begs for an easy interpretation. Yet there is not one without               a thorough understanding of Native history, thought, and culture:               the viewer is forced to recognize the artist's, and by extension               all Native Americans', authority to assign content and meaning with               an image dealing with Native Americans and their cultures. </font></p>            <font class="second"><b>Ruth Anne Phillips<br>            <a href="mailto:ruthanne_phillips@yahoo.com">ruthanne_phillips@yahoo.com</a><br>            The City University of New York, Graduate Center <br>            &quot;Framing the Inca Aesthetic&quot;</b></font><br>            <font class="second">Within the vocabulary of Inca aesthetics, there             is a tendency to emphasize particular objects, structures and even             whole sites by the presence of a frame or border. Some of these frames             have been manipulated by human technology, such as the low-lying walls             surrounding rock outcrops at Qenqo and Machu Picchu, as well as entire             buildings enclosing particular objects, as with the <i>Qorikancha</i>             at Cuzco and the Semicircular Temple at Machu Picchu. Additionally,             entire settlements and/or the surrounding landscape sometimes frame             one element at a site, such as the <i>ushnu</i> at Hu&aacute;nuco             Pampa. Conversely, such natural elements as rivers and mountains occasionally             framed whole sites like Cuzco which is framed by two rivers, and Machu             Picchu where both a sacred river and mountains frame the site. </font>             <p><font class="second">While one can look to the beliefs and worldviews               of a given culture in order to understand the meaning of its art;               one can also examine art as a way of determining a given society's               worldviews. By examining how the Inca chose to highlight objects               and sites, this paper will explore the possible cultural significance               of the Inca aesthetic of framing as it relates to architecture and               urban planning. This investigation is limited to four sites: Cuzco,               Qenqo, Hu&aacute;nuco Pampa and Machu Picchu, chosen for their variety               of state and religious functions as well as for their unmistakable               examples of framing. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Both Cuzco and Hu&aacute;nuco Pampa appear               to have been great administrative centers. As such, framing examples               at these places served to highlight the importance and power of               the Inca ruler. For example, <i>ushnu</i> platforms, used only by               Inca rulers, were framed by central plazas as well as by entire               cities. Qenqo and Machu Picchu, however, appear to have been major               sacred centers. Framing examples at these places would have highlighted               the juxtaposition of humans and gods by taking the form of low-lying               walls surrounding outcrops, fenestrated openings revealing natural               landscapes, and monuments echoing the shapes of the surrounding               natural world. These findings would suggest that framing within               the Inca aesthetic vocabulary took on particular forms in relation               to specific functions. Investigating Inca examples of framing, may,               therefore, provide deeper meanings for sites already excavated,               as well as for those yet to be unearthed. </font></p>            <p><font class="second"><b>Kinsey Katchka<br>              Indiana University<br>              &quot;Exhibiting 'The Popular': Urban Cultures and Transnationalism               in Postcolonial West Africa&quot; <br>              </b>Abstract not available</font></p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="links_events.html">Back>></a></font></p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="sym00bio.html">Bios of symposium               organizers>></a><br>              </font><font class="second"><br>              <br>              </font> </p>            </TD>          <TD width="5">&nbsp; </TD>        </TR>        </TBODY>       </TABLE>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=top align="right">&nbsp;</TD>  </TR>  <TR>     <TD vAlign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="index.html"><img src="reviews/parthome.gif" width="70" height="39" border="0" alt="home"></a>       </div>    </TD>  </TR>  <TR>    <TD vAlign=bottom>&nbsp;</TD>    <TD bgColor=#000066 colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="1">&copy;       2000 Part.
