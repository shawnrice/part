Although this is the sixth issue of PART, it is               its first issue completely under the direction of a new editor and               designer. This past spring, Alan Moore and John Angeline, the founding               editors of PART, decided to move on and asked me to take over as               managing editor. Alan and John had entrusted me with a project that               they had built from scratch, and I immersed myself wholeheartedly               into the production of the current issue. Obviously in the beginning               I had reservations, having never been involved in an e-journal or               its production, but the experience has been a rewarding and educational               one. Alan has been especially supportive and helpful, and also put               me in contact with someone interested in redesigning the website,               Emily Pugh. I feel truly fortunate to have Emily, a brilliant young               art historian and talented web designer, on my editorial staff --               Emily revamped the look of PART beginning with this issue. She had               the patience to deal the constant flow of material for uploading               to the site, with various hold-ups and deadline extensions, and               with my often less-than-perfect understanding of HTML. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">I originally proposed this issue to Alan and               John more than a year ago after hearing a lecture on Meta Vaux Warrick               Fuller given by Stacey Williams in a graduate Sculpture seminar               at the Graduate Center. Fuller, who studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts,               the Acad&eacute;mie Colarossi, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine               Arts, and privately under Rodin, was an important early twentieth               century sculptor and feminist at the height of the Harlem Renaissance               (unfortunately most of Fuller's early work was destroyed in a fire               in 1910). Stacey's work on Fuller inspired me to gather articles               on other important but lesser-known sculptors so that their work               and contributions to the history of art could be more widely understood               and explored. From Stacey's acceptance of my invitation to submit               her piece on Fuller, other equally fascinating essays followed:               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Stacy Easterday's essay on the significant               sculptor H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Bertaux, founder of the Union des               Femmes des Peintres et Sculpteurs and the major catalyst for the               opening of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris to women in 1896, is               the most recent publication on this artist to date. Her analysis               of the ways in which Bertaux marketed herself and her own sculpture               in her early years is a significant contribution to feminist discourse.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Josephine Murphy's tribute piece to the sculptor               James Novelli is an attempt to correct the omissions of recent New               York newspaper articles which surfaced when, in April of this year,               Novelli's <i>Victory</i> was destroyed by two rogues in Brooklyn.               Many sculpture historians were distressed by the unsettling news               of the sculpture's disappearance, and then its later discovery in               a scrap metal shop. Novelli's <i>Victory</i>, although not necessarily               famous, was a part of American sculpture history and its loss is               greatly felt. Its destruction makes many of us fear the loss of               our other public treasures and question the city's ability to protect               them. </font></p>            <p><font class="second"> &quot;Ghiberti and Manz&#249;: Alternative               Means of 'Piercing' the Flat&quot; is Raphy Sarkissian's second               contribution to PART. His essay imparts a refreshing and modern               analysis on perspective in the works of Lorenzo Ghiberti (in his               <i>Gates of Paradise</i>) and Giacomo Manz&#249; (in his <i>Gates               of Death</i>). The physical act of piercing, slashing, and puncturing               the surface of an object is investigated in relation to a complete               body of theoretical writings, giving the idea of perspective in               sculpture a renewed depth. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Zachary Ross deals with the issue of Brancusi's               legacy in his article, &quot;Peasant Wisdom: An Analysis of Brancusi's               Rumanian Heritage.&quot; Rarely explored in Brancusi studies is               the affect that the artist's youth in Rumania became a source of               inspiration for his later works; thus Zachary attempts to correct               this omission. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Brian Edward Hack's essay is an absorbing               account of the underlying theme of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International               Exposition, held in San Francisco. The American interest in Eugenics               and Social Darwinism at the very moment of the Exposition gave rise               to an abundance of sculptures promoting the idea of human biological               perfection. It is both fascinating and frightening to learn of the               interest in the <i>&uuml;bermensch</i> in America, and its stalwart promoters               in art and science, years before the advent of the Second World               War. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Two essays in our Reviews section deal with               recent exhibitions or installations. Robin Clark's review of Robert               Smithson's drawings from the early 1960s is based on a recent exhibition               held at Cohan Gallery this past spring. It is a pleasure to publish               a piece on the output of a sculptor in another medium; most sculptors               produce excellent drawings which are often ignored by scholars.               Dana Pilson offered to review the recent completion of the second               phase of the Greek galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.               Although many of us have visited the newly renovated rooms, it is               wonderful to have a current account of the project and information               about its final phase. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Our Practice section features articles which               deal specifically with recent ideas in teaching, museum work, process               notes and field research. For this issue we have received contributions               from Elena Kemelman, Herbert Hartel and Betti-Sue Hertz. Two are               concerned with sculptures on CUNY campuses. Elena's process notes               on the Hall of Fame For Great Americans, located on the scenic campus               of CUNY's Bronx Community College, is the most complete account               of the sculpture program to be published to date. Her lists of artists               and figures represented and related websites will be vital resource               for anyone working on nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American               sculpture. Herb's piece on John Crawford's Queens College Marker               is a discussion of one of a series of Crawford's 'markers', and               relates the sculpture convincingly to Richard Serra's <i>Tilted               Arc</i>. Betti-Sue Hertz has contributed a review which was originally               published in the catalogue for <i>Transposed: Analogs of Built Space</i>,               an exhibition she curated at the Sculpture Center last spring. </font></p>            <p><font class="second">Finally, I want to thank all who contributed               new ideas, suggestions, comments and even criticisms, in the hopes               of reshaping and improving the journal: Jennifer Farrell, Karen               Lemmey, Mele Mauala, Margaret Stenz, Lisa-Jaye Young, and Raul Zamudio.               </font></p>            <p><font class="second">I would like to invite our readers to bookmark               our site and visit often for updates.
