Zemel has pointed                   out that Van Gogh had a wish to return to the simple, peasant                   life of the weavers of the village of Nuenen where he grew up.                   Zemel explained that Van Gogh read books, like George Eliot&#8217;s                   <em>Silas Marner</em> (1861), which reinforced this longing                   for a &#8220;Bucolic Paradise&#8221;.

Homberg explains &#8220;During his two month visit                   to Arles, Gauguin tried to convince Van Gogh that he should                   not paint from nature, but base his composition on memory. Only                   then, could the artist use his imagination to create a truly,                   modern work of art that was an extraction from nature instead                   of a representation.&#8221; Gauguin articulated his ideas on                   painting from his imagination in a letter to a friend. He wrote,                   &#8220;Do not copy too much from nature. Art is an abstraction;                   derive it from nature whilst dreaming in front of nature, and                   think more of its creation than the result.&#8221; </p>                <p class="second">15.

Van Gogh, <em>Letters</em> Vol.3, Letter 594,179.                   Cirlot writes that the colors green and black have a strong                   symbolic connection. Green is the color of vegetation and black                   is the color of the fertilized earth. This combination of these                   two colors symbolizes the cycle of death and regeneration. In                   my opinion, Van Gogh&#8217;s combing of these two colors for                   the cypress may also symbolize this idea of rebirth or immortality.                   Chevalier writes of a similar symbolism of the color black,                   &#8220;In the west black is the color of mourning, yet originally                   it was a symbol of fertility, in ancient Egypt, for example;                   and in North Africa, being the color of rich earth.&#8221; It                   is also interesting to note that Van Gogh referred to the Egyptians                   in his letters as &#8220;eternal tillers of the soil.&#8221;                   One wonders, if he knew of this symbolism, especially since                   he also associated the cypress with Egyptian obelisks as noted                   in this study. </p>                <p class="second">29.

She wrote, &#8220;The cypress                   tree is infused with energy, movement, and light, with the flickering                   quality of passing between two worlds, earth and air, reality                   and dream.&#8221; She then went on to quote Michelet who wrote,                   &#8220;The Persian idea, true as well as sublime, is that the                   cypress, a pyramidal tree whose tip imitates a flame, is a mediator                   of land and sky.&#8221; (La Montagne, pg. 129.) She went on                   to conclude that this quote was &#8220;An imaginable model for                   Van Gogh&#8217;s hallucination.&#8221; </p>                <p class="second">30.Van Gogh, <em>Letters</em> Vol.2, Letter                   596, 185. </p>                <p class="second">31.Van Gogh, <em>Letters</em> Vol.3, Letter                   520, 7. </p>                <p class="second">32.Van Gogh, <em>Letters</em> Vol.3, Letter                   347, 234. </p>                <p class="second">33.

In letter W8, Van Gogh encouraged his sister Will to                   read Whitman&#8217;s poetry. He noted a particular love for                   the poem, &#8220;A Prayer of Columbus.&#8221; He wrote: Have                   you read the American poems by Whitman?...I strongly advise                   you to read them&#8230;He sees in the future, and even in the                   present, a world of healthy, carnal love, strong and frank--of                   friendship--of work-- under the great starlit vault of heaven                   as something which after all, one can only call God -- and eternity                   in its place above the world. At first it makes you smile, it                   is all so candid and pure; but it sets you thinking for the                   same reason. The &#8220;Prayer of Columbus&#8221; is very beautiful.&quot;                   Van Gogh may have found comfort in several sections of &#8220;Prayer                   of Columbus.&#8221; In the poem, Whitman referred to the power                   of God as &#8220;A ray of light&#8230;Rare unintelligible.&#8221;                   This type of linguistic imagery would have appealed to Van Gogh,                   because he often referred to the divine power of God, as a &#8220;Ray                   on high.&#8221; He might also have identified with this particular                   poem because it speaks of life&#8217;s journey, as one traveled                   on a rough sea seeking the guidance of the Lord. This idea is                   also found in Bunyan&#8217;s <em>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</em>.                   Van Gogh viewed his choice to become an artist as a perilous                   ocean journey under divine guidance. He wrote, &#8220;I will                   take the risk and push off to the open sea.

Kuebrich explained                   that on the night of President Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s inauguration,                   Whitman wrote in his notebook that the &#8220;western star,                   Venus&#8230;has never been so large, so clear&#8230;it seemed                   a &#8220;miracle&#8221; which &#8220;suffused the soul.&#8221;                   Kuebrich went on to say that after the President&#8217;s death,                   the poet identified Lincoln&#8217;s immortal soul with Venus,                   in his poem &#8220;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed.&#8221;                   In this poem Whitman wrote, &#8220;O powerful western fallen                   star!&#8221; in reference to Lincoln. Kuebrich felt that this                   quote refers to resurrection and immortality.

Presently, I am working on my master's thesis                   exploring both Whitman and Van Gogh&#8217;s interest in the                   plight of the lower classes of society. Both men treated peasant                   and working class laborers in their work.
