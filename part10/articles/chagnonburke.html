class="second">In                   the winter storms of 1999, one of the first items of news to                   be widely reported by the French media was the destruction of                   many of the ancient trees on the grounds of the Ch&acirc;teau                   de Versailles. Many of the last trees planted during Louis XIV&#8217;s                   reign fell, and experts announced that it would take over two                   hundred years for the park to look the same again. Versailles                   and its spectacular gardens like the Forest of Fontainebleau                   and its castle, which are the topic of this essay, are examples                   of monuments where nature has become as significant as the buildings                   it surrounds.</p>                <p class="second"> In France as well as in other western countries,                   the longevity of trees and especially oak trees has been for                   centuries a way to measure the passage of time. The oak tree                   and the specific symbolism that has grown around it since antiquity                   was by the 1850s a privilege site for anchoring French national                   identity. Beyond wars, revolution, heroes and their deeds, the                   oak tree has been witness to the temporality of human life and                   political regimes. The oak tree brought the French back to their                   native soil, to nature itself, beyond their personal and political                   allegiances. The oak tree has always been considered the archetypal                   French tree: from the druids to King Saint Louis, who chose                   to administer justice under its branches, to being the choice                   for the liberty tree during the Revolution, the oak tree has                   long been recognized as the national tree.</p>                <p class="second"> This essay examines a specific moment in order                   to better understand the fascination trees have held for urbanized                   western society in the past two hundred years. In the 1850s,                   Parisians looked at nature in a very different way than the                   people who actually lived in the country. It was a way that                   was, of course, deeply conditioned by their urban lives. Nature                   and the forest were not considered exploitable natural resources.                   Wilderness, untouched nature, was cherished and not simply a                   wasteland to be put to use. The forest was a place where one                   could escape; find subjects matter for artistic works, and experience                   with nostalgia for an ancient and undisturbed order of things.</p>                <p class="second"> While the 1840s saw the development of Parisian                   metropolitan culture, it also witnessed the anchoring of French                   identity in its countryside and its geographical diversity.                   The paintings of the naturalist landscape artists of the Barbizon                   School, the works of historians such as Augustin Thierry and                   Jules Michelet, and the desire to escape a city which was increasingly                   perceived as corrupt and unhealthy are all part of the same                   phenomenon, the crystallization of this new sense of national                   character.[1] The Forest of Fontainebleau, some forty miles                   south of Paris was the perfect place to embody these new ideas                   about national identity. It was bordered at one end by the royal                   residence of Fontainebleau and on the other by the small village                   of <a href="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part10/articles/www.discoverfrance.net/France/%20Museums/Ecole-Barbizon.shtml" class="linkbody">Barbizon</a>                   where most of the artists had settled by 1849.[2]</p>                <p class="second"> As historical site, the forest has enjoyed                   uninterrupted fame as a royal hunting ground since Francis I,                   while providing kings and emperors with substantial revenues.[3]</p>                <p class="second"> Its privileged status as a royal domain paradoxically                   protected the forest from disappearing completely under the                   pressure of the surrounding agriculture. It was accessible only                   through an infrastructure of paths and alleys maintained by                   official agents and civil servants. During the July Monarchy,                   for instance, its staff numbered fifty-two. By the 1840s the                   forest had become a favorite haunt of artists and tourists alike,                   for all were able to enjoy this place whose longevity celebrated                   the endurance of national character through an unbroken connection                   with the past.[4]</p>                <p class="second"> The extreme diversity of its landscapes was                   initially what attracted artists to the forest of Fontainebleau.                   Artists had recognized these qualities since the early 1800s.                   Tourists followed soon after.[5] By the late 1830s, the growing                   appreciation by the urban middle-class of landscape paintings                   made the Fontainebleau forest an excellent destination for artists.[6]                   As It was close enough to the capital to be easily reachable                   first by coach then by train; the forest itself soon became                   a familiar subject matter, easily recognizable by the potential                   client. From manicured alleys and well-tended tree plantations                   (too many for artists&#8217; tastes) to barren canyons and sandy                   deserts (much preferred by the artists), from ponds to fields                   dotted with strange granite boulders, the forest was capable                   of provoking a wide range of sensations in its visitors. It                   was a microcosm representative of the many landscapes of the                   nation. </p>                <p class="second">The period of roughly 1830 to the 1870s was                   a period of relative peace in France, essential for the construction                   of this new self-image. It would eventually find its full political                   and cultural expression during the early Third Republic, when                   landscape painting was finally officially accepted as an integral                   part of the healing and reconstructing process after the trauma                   of the Franco-Prussian War and of the Commune. After decades                   of neglect, at the 1874 Salon the State finally bought twenty-nine                   landscape paintings, and in 1879 Jules Ferry announced major                   changes in State art policy in favor of open-air painting and                   modern-life subjects.[7]</p>                <p class="second"> By the late 1840s, however, the artists and                   writers associated with the village of Barbizon realized that                   what they had revered in the forest a sense of timelessness,                   of communion with the wild was gradually being compromised by                   the tourist industry and by the commercial exploitation of the                   forest itself. </p>                <p class="second">While revered, the majestic oaks of Fontainebleau                   were also being destroyed by commercial exploitation. In 1861,                   the oak trees still numbered over fifty percent of all the trees                   in the Fontainebleau forest. However, pine trees had been systematically                   planted since the eighteenth century as re-forestation rapidly                   threatened them, despite the fact that pine trees were not indigenous                   to the forest. In the most barren areas, beeches and some silver                   birches grew.[8] The oak trees brought the most revenues to                   the royal coffers. As the forest was part of the liste civile,                   which was the personal fund of the rulers, its profits went                   directly into first Louis-Philippe and then Napoleon III&#8217;s                   pockets. According to Denecourt&#8217;s 1840&#8217;s guide,                   the forest could yield a revenue between 500,000 to 600,000                   francs a year, and more precise records indicate that some years,                   especially in the 1840s, could bring in 900,000 francs from                   sale of timber from these trees.[9]</p>                <p class="second">Throughout the July Monarchy and the Second                   Empire, many art critics joined artists, such as Th&eacute;odore                   Rousseau, in denouncing the negative impact of tourism, as well                   as the commercial exploitation of the forest. This included                   quarries as well as timber, for the cobbled stone that covered                   Paris&#8217;s new boulevards was made from the granite of the                   Fontainebleau forest. As early as 1839, <em>L'Artiste</em>,                   the leading art magazine of the period published an article                   denouncing a plan to plant even more pine trees on the barren                   sandy wastes of the Fontainebleau forest. In the press and in                   special letter campaigns to the authorities, critics and artists                   set out to defend the forest and their livelihood against the                   encroachment of developing capitalism.[10]</p>                <p class="second">Among Th&eacute;odore Rousseau&#8217;s papers,                   now in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, there is the copy of a petition                   that echoes the articles published in the press. In that petition                   written in 1852 and addressed to Napoleon III, Rousseau demanded                   that the forest be designated as monument historique. He denounced                   the commercial exploitation of the forest, stating that the                   1100 hectares already protected were insufficient and proposing                   that the forest should be protected in the name of art. He attacked                   the forestry administration and the tourist industry for putting                   profits before the interests of the forest. Rousseau and his                   friend/biographer/dealer-promoter Alfred Sensier presented the                   petition to the Emperor through le duc de Morny. Morny had been                   impressed by Rousseau&#8217;s work, having attended the auction                   sale of his paintings earlier that year. Rousseau essentially                   wanted to preserve the most spectacular and untamable sites                   of the forest: The Bas-Br&eacute;au, the Gorges d&#8217;Apremont,                   the Monts-Girard, the Plateau de Bellecroix, and the Gorges                   aux Loups [See Map of the Forest of Fontainebleau, Th&eacute;odore                   Rousseau, <em>The Great Oaks of Old Bas-Br&eacute;au</em>, 1864,                   Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Th&eacute;odore Rousseau, <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/view1.asp?dep=11&item=96%2E27" class="linkbody"><em>The                   Edge of the Woods at Monts-Girard</em></a>, 1854, Metropolitan                   Museum of Art]. These were the sites that he and other artists                   painted most often.</p>                <p class="second">A survey and study of the forest followed Rousseau&#8217;s                   petition. In this study the forest agents argued against Rousseau                   and his ideas of non-intervention. If the forest was to be preserved,                   it was through selective exploitation and re-planting. If the                   trees were allowed to die naturally, as Rousseau wanted, the                   forest would eventually degenerate, the official said. But finally                   in 1863, Napoleon III signed a decree setting aside 1,097 hectares                   of the Fontainebleau forest as a r&eacute;serve artistique,                   which could not be exploited commercially. Ultimately this area                   was actually much larger than what the foresters had recommended.<br>                  For the artists and their supporters, preserving the wildness                   of the forest and its diversity meant letting nature pursue                   its course with minimal human intervention. It was not motivated                   only by what we would now call environmental concerns, but also                   by the fear of losing still more picturesque views to the pine                   trees, tourist paths, and woodcutters&#8217; saws. <br>                  Among these artists, some lived in Barbizon year round or stayed                   for extended periods of time in the summer, others traveled                   from Paris or from neighboring villages, but they all maintained                   closed connections to the capital. Th&eacute;odore Rousseau,                   for example, kept a Parisian studio after moving to Barbizon.                   The critic Th&eacute;ophile Thor&eacute; visited him in Barbizon,                   and then turned his visit into a series of articles promoting                   the work of Rousseau and the threatened wilderness as if they                   were one.[11] Both Rousseau and the oak trees were described                   as the indigenous inhabitants of the Forest. This trope was                   developed even further by Alfred Sensier, who, in his later                   biography of Rousseau, claimed that the painter could hear the                   voice of these ancient treesand understand their stories without                   word, positing an ecological model of communication between                   all different members of the similar environment.[12]</p>                <p class="second">By looking at the paintings that Camille Corot                   and Th&eacute;odore Rousseau excecuted of the ancient oaks of                   the Fontainebleau Forest, we can see that they can acquire a                   much richer meaning if they are examined against the growing                   concern with the transformation and the preservation of the                   forest. Paintings such as Corot&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mairie-lyon.fr/evenements_archives/ecole_de_barbizon/presentation_1.html" class="linkbody"><em>Fontainebleau,                   Le Rageur</em></a> (1830-32, private collection) and Rousseau&#8217;s                   <a href="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part10/articles/www.artchive.com/artchiv/R/rousseau_t/rousseaut_apremont.jpg.html" class="linkbody"><em>Oak                   Trees in the Gorge of Apremont</em></a> (c.1850-52, Mus&eacute;e                   du Louvre), best exemplify the symbolic value attached to such                   trees. Denoncourt gave the ancient oak trees of the Fontainebleau                   Forest names such as Le Rageur, Le Sully, Le Henri IV, le D&eacute;luge,                   and Le Gutenberg. By 1893 there were two hundred and seventy-six                   named trees, and three hundred and twenty-three by 1916. The                   oldest still standing is named Le Jupiter. In <em>Fontainebeau,                   Le Rageur</em>, Corot presented the oak tree as a survivor,                   growing wild out of the boulder. While this tree embodied the                   symbolic qualities of longevity and endurance it was also one                   of the most threatened species of the forest,. In <em>Fontainebleau,                   Le Rageur</em>, Corot confronts the audience with a piece of                   nature, as if seized by a traveler on the move; the oak dominates,                   while the human presence lets us measure the real size of the                   tree. </p>                <p class="second">In one of the earliest articles on the School                   of Barbizon published in 1866 in <em>L&#8217;Artiste</em>, Hector                   Callias stressed the connection between the Barbizon painters                   and primordial France, comparing the painters to druids worshipping                   the oak tree. He argued that as the Gauls opposed the Romans,                   these painters rejected the classical tradition to find their                   exclusive inspiration in nature. Callias's article is an example                   of the prevalence of this new national consciousness. In keeping                   with the idea of a Gaelic France and by transforming the painters                   of Barbizon into druids, he claimed for these artists an ancestry                   outside the Greco-Roman classical tradition valued by the Academy.[13]</p>                <p class="second"> Callias assert a quasi-religious status for                   these artists by referring to them as druids, but he also promoted                   them as rugged and primitive bearded individuals, close to the                   nature they painted. Just like the peasant-painter, the trope                   of the original savage-painter, uncorrupted by the urban civilization                   and academic teaching, was firmly in place by the middle of                   the century. One needs only to remember how in the 1850s the                   realist painter Gustave Courbet actively cultivated his controversial                   persona: the artist as ruffian, individualistic and unmannered.                   He made sure he retained his regional accent and customs as                   a sign of independence from the official artistic institutions.[14]</p>                <p class="second"> This preoccupation with France, its historical                   past, its national character, and its countryside had once been                   related to romantic nationalism and the need to redefine national                   boundaries after the fall of Napoleon&#8217;s empire in 1815,                   but by the 1830s, it had become a truly complex phenomenon.                   The landscape paintings of the School of Barbizon were only                   one expression of this attempt to define Frenchness. One could                   see in the rustic novels of George Sand, the poems of Pierre                   Dupont and the works of historians such as Augustin Thierry                   and Jules Michelet, some other facets of a similar phenomenon.                 </p>                <p class="second">Thierry and Michelet&#8217;s works on the Gauls                   and the origin of France shed new light on the history of the                   Third Estate. Instead of concentrating only on the monarchy,                   Michelet insisted that the &#8216;true France&#8217; was rural                   France. Since the 1789 Revolution, the Gauls had been replacing                   the Franks as the founding fathers of France. The acceptance                   by the bourgeoisie of its Gaelic origins came to symbolize democratic                   freedom. After the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, the Franks were                   finally totally dispossessed from their historical role, they                   were definitely too German.[15]</p>                <p class="second"> We should understand the denunciation of the                   commercial exploitation of the Fontainebleau forest not so much                   as an act of political rebellion against the oppressive governments                   of the July Monarchy and the Second Empire, but rather as the                   penetration into the establishment of an early nationalistic                   rhetoric only a few decades after the Revolution of 1789. These                   paintings seem to have supported a specific idea of what France                   meant to its people, an idea rooted in the permanence of the                   past, the rural and the historical, where man works in symbiosis                   with nature, part of the natural order. Rousseau&#8217;s <a href="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part10/articles/www.metmuseum.org/collections/view1.asp?dep=11&amp;full=1&amp;item=11.4" class="linkbody"><em>A                   Forest at Sunset in Winter</em></a> (1846-67, Metropolitan Museum                   of Art) and <em>Group of Oaks in the Apremont Gorges</em> (1852,                   Mus&eacute;e du Louvre) [Ill. #1] exemplify these specific ideas.                   In an 1857 article published in <em>L'Artiste</em>, S. Cambray                   reviewed all the different type of trees and their value to                   the painter. The oak is quickly elevated to anthropomorphic                   form, the equivalent of the human figure in history painting                   imbued with nobility and virility, and is also compared to a                   hero from antiquity, withstanding the elements with courage                   and majesty even in its old age.[16]</p>                <p class="second">Like Rousseau himself, the peasants he represented                   in the painting live in symbiosis with nature. They are either                   herding animals, by then a disappearing practice or gathering                   fallen dead wood. Unlike Millet, Rousseau rarely painted the                   cultivated fields. These paintings were not about agriculture,                   about the domination of men over nature, as in paintings of                   Rosa Bonheur such as <a href="http://www.culture.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=AUTR&VALUE_1=BONHEUR%20Rosa&DOM=All&REL_SPECIFIC=1&IMAGE_ONLY=CHECKED" class="linkbody"><em>Haymaking                   Auvergne</em></a>, (1855, Mus&eacute;e des domaines nationaux                   du ch&acirc;teau de Fontainebleau). Being able to let your cattle                   graze and gathering dead fallen wood had been two special privileges                   given traditionally to the population surrounding the forest                   as compensation for the damages incurred on their private property                   during royal hunts. But just as Monet later turned his back                   on the pollution and the factories of Argenteuil, as in his                   <a href="http://www.nga.gov.au/MonetJapan/Detail.cfm?WorkID=W290" class="linkbody"><em>Effets                   d&#8217;automne &agrave; Argenteuil</em></a> (1873, Courtauld                   Institute Gallery, London), in <em>A Forest at Sunset in Winter</em>                   Rousseau made Bas-Br&eacute;au look inaccessible and untouched                   by modernity, as none of the tourist paths are visible. The                   faggot gatherers are here rendered minuscule, blending into                   the fabric of the paint itself. Rousseau looked at the relationship                   between all living things in a specific environment. The forest                   of Fontainebleau had become its own ecosystem, where peasants                   and painters were naturalized as its original inhabitants. Painters                   and their supporters were allied against the tourists and pine                   trees, they were both rejected as foreign elements.</p>                <p class="second"> In <em>Fontainebleau, Le Rageur</em> and in                   <em>A Forest in Winter at Sunset</em>, each artist decides to                   erase any trace that could connect us with the tourist or commercial                   exploitation of the forest. Their vision is rooted in nostalgia,                   in the land and its inhabitants. But the painters also provide                   a vision of the forest that could please and soothe a potential                   client, usually an urban dweller who wanted--even imaginatively--                   to escape the city, and sought the same emotion that Rousseau                   aims to preserve in his canvas. On the contrary, if one looks                   at a contemporary photograph taken in the forest of Le ch&ecirc;ne                   de l&#8217;Empereur, one can see that the photographer has not                   chosen to avoid modernity, but has embraced the cohabitation                   of the top-hat urbanite with the white smock peasant [ill. #2,                   William Harrison, Pr&egrave;s de la mare &agrave; Dagnan, le                   ch&ecirc;ne de l&#8217;Empereur, 1870.</p>                <p class="second"> The forest, and by extension the paintings                   which depicted it, attracted many different ideologies. For                   Alfred Sensier, it symbolizes a mythical eternal agrarian natural                   order. While his ideas were grounded in the philosophy of the                   Enlightenment and in the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, they                   were also imbued with a by now secular democratic-republican                   ideal typical among the Parisian bourgeoisie that Sensier, a                   civil servant, belonged to.[17] However, Sensier&#8217;s agenda                   was rather conservative; but for radical critics like Th&eacute;ophile                   Thor&eacute;, the forest epitomized freedom rather than nostalgia.                   Thor&eacute;&#8217;s republicanism pushed him to politicize                   Rousseau&#8217;s paintings in order to support his demand for                   a national art. This proves that nature was never really as                   a neutral place as it seemed to be.[18]</p>                <p class="second"> The symbolism attached to the Forest of Fontainebleau                   and evident in the canvases of artists like Rousseau, Corot,                   or Dupr&eacute; was used by different voices for different reasons.                   It could be used to support the views of the conservative Parisian                   bourgeoisie but also the views of the utopian socialist followers                   of Saint-Simon and Fourier, who had so inspired Thor&eacute;.                   Their pursuit of love and harmony saw the establishment of rural                   communes as the cornerstone of their new order. Finally there                   were two additional factors extremely significant in Napoleon                   III&#8217;s decision to set aside part of the Forest of Fontainebleau                   for conservation against the advice of his foresters. First,                   nature was not just preserved for its own sake, but because                   the administration recognized the important role the forest                   played in the renewal of French landscape painting, which was                   hailed as the glory of the French School by the early 1850s.                   In an article by Philippe Burty for La Renaissance artistique,                   1872 Fontainebleau was not seen as only a museum but also as                   the &#8220;wet nurse of modern landscape.&#8221;[19] To conserve                   plots of &#8220;untouched&#8221; ancient forest for artists                   and tourists meant that wilderness survived only to be transformed                   into the ultimate artifice: a painting. But most importantly                   this also meant that the government understood that after the                   succession of revolutions since 1789, nature and in this particular                   case the Forest of Fontainebleau, could be used to promote ideas                   of permanence and stability.</p>                <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>                <p class="second"><a href="chagnonburke_notes.html" class="linkbody">Sources&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p class="second"><a href="chagnonburke_bio.html" class="linkbody">Author's                   Bio&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p class="second">&nbsp; </p>                </td>          <td width="10">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>       <td height="511" valign=bottom>         <div align="center">          <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../index.html">P<em>ART</em></a></font><a href="../index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            home </font></a></p>          </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>      <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;         2004</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">         P<i>ART</i> and V&eacute;ronique Chagnon-Burke.
