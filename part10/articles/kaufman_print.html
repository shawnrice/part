She was also a theorist and promoter                   of experimental cinema and a participant in the now legendary                   1940s-50s American avant-garde centered in New York City&#8217;s                   Greenwich Village. By the 1950s Deren&#8217;s ideas on art and                   film were often dismissed for several reasons: she was a woman                   interested in abstract ideas and objectivity, she was an active                   initiate in Haitian Voudoun, and she was intense, outspoken,                   and unconventional. In spite of this dismissal, her films, though                   few in number, helped establish experimental film as a vital                   and valid art form in the U.S. and continue to hold an influential                   place in our cultural imagination.</p>                <p class="second"> Deren&#8217;s concept of art includes a complex                   and multidisciplinary notion of nature, which in her films is                   represented through landscape. By examining this aspect of her                   work and thought, we can better consider the &#8220;cinematic                   landscape,&#8221; an under-recognized twentieth-century reworking                   of landscape traditions.[1]</p>                <p class="second"> In <em>Anagram</em> (1946), Deren expresses                   her most complete statement on art in order to posit experimental                   film as a fine art and distinguish it from commercial narrative                   and documentary film. Deren reiterates throughout her essay                   the implications of the split in human consciousness caused                   by scientific rationality.[2] Deren notes that science made                   nature secular and separate from human beings, which led to                   nature being seen as amoral, ambiguous, and irrational. Yet                   science also allowed people to transform nature through applications                   of rational consciousness. Some, especially the romantic artists,                   tried to reunite with nature to absolve moral responsibility,                   but Deren sees these artists as narcissistic and self-exalting.[3]                   Deren believes that artists must be conscious in their creative                   acts, morally engaged, free of ego-based individualism. Thus                   she rejects expressionism and its subjectivity and sees the                   surrealist goal of the unconscious artist using automatism as                   unachievable and irresponsible. </p>                <p class="second"> The basis of art for Deren is consciousness.                   For her, consciousness replaces God in secular modern cultural                   aesthetics. But this consciousness has nothing to do with mimetic                   or realist art, which for Deren is too familiar and uncreative                   since it substitutes description for art.[4] Instead art requires                   a &#8220;horizontal&#8221; process of memory through which one                   can access all experience and knowledge simultaneously.[5] Through                   Deren&#8217;s horizontal process, one may think abstractly about                   one&#8217;s experience, which leads not to subjectivity, but                   to depersonalization and detachment. Memory facilitates imagination,                   which &#8220;accelerates&#8221; natural processes so that they                   become unreal and abstract. The artist tries to create forms                   that are as dynamic as those in nature without copying them.                   Thus, nature is a model for art, but a parallel one that does                   not lead to surrealist revelation, or realist or documentary                   mimesis.</p>                <p class="second"> In Deren&#8217;s concept of art, memory and                   consciousness lead artists to use abstracted forms to relate                   to whatever they deify or most value.[6] This relationship makes                   art a form of ritual that refers to origin, function, and preservation,                   and origin, or what we might call identity and use. Deren, who                   studied Haitian Voudoun and Balinese dance, sees this ritualistic                   aspect of art as cross-cultural. To Deren artistic ritual is                   related to scientific investigation in that both art and science                   depend on conscious and objective exploration. Deren&#8217;s                   art is synthetic and generalized, a life force unto itself that                   is of social consequence because it raises consciousness in                   both the artist and the viewer.</p>                <p class="second"> Unlike most modernists who used cross-cultural                   interests as a form of primitivism, Deren rejects the &#8220;primitive&#8221;                   as a construct of western individualism through which artists                   escape into subjectivity.[7] Instead of appropriating the forms                   of other cultures, Deren engaged the community she found there.                   She believed that western culture had lost its sense of community                   partly through its loss of ritual. What drew her strongly to                   Voudoun in the late 1940s, after her most influential films                   were made, was its possibilities as a social ritual experienced                   through community and the totality of one&#8217;s consciousness.                 </p>                <p class="second"> To Deren, ritual involves the mind and the                   body. The more aspects involved, the more effective the ritual.                   Deren&#8217;s attraction to dance, poetry, film and music was                   her conviction that these were what remained of ritual in our                   society. She wanted art to create new forms of ritual that would                   lead to new social community, and we are reminded that in the                   1930s, like many intellectuals from Eastern Europe, Deren was                   a socialist activist. This may be why the theme of social transformation                   plays such a major role in her work.</p>                <p class="second"> Deren&#8217;s writing in <em>Anagram</em> is                   done in non-linear and generalized sections so that topics are                   not developed conventionally, but through overlapping themes.                   One of these themes is our relationship to nature and landscape.                   Deren did not think of landscape in symbolic terms. Symbols                   were for her meanings whose original cultural contexts were                   lost to our memory and thus had to be learned or studied, and                   therefore were less vital in the ritual context defined above.[8]                   It is noteworthy that Deren frames then-current debates about                   art in terms of landscape. There is the familiar landscape of                   the realist and the interior landscape of the surrealist, both                   of which she rejected. Instead she sees herself working more                   on the utopian landscape that she associates with the romantic                   tradition, and which she calls &#8220;inner or outer geography.&#8221;[9]                   She celebrates the romantics for their quest for originality                   and skill, but not for their subjectivity and escapism. We will                   return to the romantic threads of Deren&#8217;s landscape when                   we analyze <em>At Land</em>.</p>                <p class="second"> The term &#8220;inner and outer geography&#8221;                   situates the human being in Deren&#8217;s concept of landscape.                   Her concept is much closer to what Malcolm Andrews and Holmes                   Rolston call an environment, or a landscape defined by a living                   being existing in nature and experiencing it as a complex of                   sensations.[10] Inner and outer geography relates to an environment                   in which people experience interior and exterior states. This                   concept of geography relates to how Deren defines an image and                   its formal qualities.</p>                <p class="second"> From the poetry of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound,                   which Deren studied for her masters thesis, she took the idea                   that an image synthesizes form and content in an intellectual                   and emotional complex revealed through the logic of its formal                   structure.[11] Another English poet, whom Deren might have studied                   or absorbed indirectly through her studies of the Imagists,                   is Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-89, published in 1918), who theorized                   the concept of an &#8220;inscape.&#8221; To Hopkins an inscape                   is a landscape that is penetrated intellectually and emotionally,                   manifests laws of energy, and whose natural patterns are abstracted                   forms.[12] As we shall see this is an apt description of how                   Deren realizes &#8220;inner and outer geography&#8221; and landscape                   in <em>At Land</em>.</p>                <p class="second"> Part of this logic of form for Deren was how                   art creates it own gestalt context of an &#8220;emergent whole.&#8221;                   She thought this formal context of art was artificial and that                   art&#8217;s wholeness of form subsumes and transcends an art                   work&#8217;s parts.[13] How this wholeness unifies the multiple                   images of shots and sequences defines film as a medium. Deren,                   influenced by her psychiatrist father who had studied physiological                   perception with the same teacher as did the Russian filmmaker                   Vertov, believed that perception is a complex and synthetic                   physical process involving multiple senses.[14] Such an analysis,                   coupled with her experience in modern dance, led Deren to define                   an aesthetic of objective physiological effect related as much                   to the body as to mental and visual processes. Deren thought                   that the content of a work depended on context, but saw context                   as the gestalt form of the work. Such ideas prefigure the minimalist                   aesthetic of the 1960s, which also related to ideas of dance                   and gestalt psychology.</p>                <p class="second"> Although Deren was critical of the split caused                   by science and its ability to create atomic weapons of mass                   destruction, she thinks that art, like science, must be objective                   and based on rational planning and skills. As in scientific                   research, Deren saw the creative process as a logical extension                   of a known reality.[15] Countering the Beat aesthetics of Jonas                   Mekas, Deren was against film as improvisation. Improvisation                   was too ego-based and subjective for Deren.[16] To her film                   was a formal effect, based not on the narrative realism and                   drama of Hollywood, which Andre Bazin influentially theorized,                   but on space/time/motion manipulation.</p>                <p class="second"> Deren&#8217;s focus on form categorizes her                   as a formalist or classicist, but this did not lead her to abstract                   film. She saw abstract film based on animation as too much like                   painting. Hollywood film may have formal sense, but Deren thought                   it formulaic, commercial, and without sustained creativity or                   transforming responsibility. To her Hollywood produced empty                   dreams.[17] Deren believed that film form was a result of its                   material technology. In many ways her ideas about media specificity                   parallel ideas developed by the critic Clement Greenberg, but                   make more sense because of the photographic and mechanical nature                   of film processes. </p>                <p class="second"> Deren, in an effort to complicate meaning,                   layers the memory/narrative development (the linear horizontal)                   with &#8220;verticality&#8221; or poetic and associative meanings.[18]                   To understand what Deren means by horizontal and vertical landscape                   more fully, one must turn to her films and examine them more                   closely. Though <em>Meshes of the Afternoon</em> (1943) and                   <em>A Study in Choreography for Camera</em> (1945) refer to                   landscape, it is <em>At Land</em> (1944) in which landscape                   is featured. Considered by many to be the first complete expression                   by Deren without the collaborating influence of her husband,                   Alexander Hammid, the &#8220;verticality&#8221; of the fifteen-minute                   At Land was later described by Deren as a reversal of Homer&#8217;s                   <em>Odyssey</em> in which she plays the lead. Deren relates                   how her version differs because instead of searching, the protagonist                   finds the universe has taken dynamic action away from human                   will by replacing stability of place with an impersonal, relativistic                   flux that leaves identity as the only constant.[19] </p>                <p class="second"> Inspired partly by the mythic grandeur of Martha                   Graham&#8217;s archetypes and by her own cross-cultural studies                   of Hinduism (she changed her name in 1943 to Maya, the Hindu                   Goddess of illusion and cosmic motion), Deren often speaks in                   terms that are mythic and cosmological in scope. This doesn&#8217;t                   mean that her ideas are outmoded, but that we need to translate                   them through our own ideological and theoretical prejudices.                   Mark Franco writes that the milieu of modern dance that Deren                   experienced in New York contributed to her use of the human                   body as a depersonalized and abstract form rather than as a                   carrier of character. He also says that Graham&#8217;s concept                   of &#8220;inner landscape,&#8221; which was about feminine introspection                   and denied to male dancers, was very influential.[20] This may                   have influenced Deren, who often featured dance in her films,                   to think of the female figure moving in a landscape of &#8220;inner                   and outer geography.&#8221; She also argued that filmmaking                   was similar to choreography because in both one works with space,                   time, and motion.</p>                <p class="second"> The narrative part of <em>At Land</em>&#8217;s                   &#8220;horizontal&#8221; synopsis can be described as follows.                   Ocean waves break against the shore. There is a woman (Deren)                   on the shore and the waves wash over her. She seems semi-conscious,                   but we cut to her point-of-view. She sees waves go out in reverse.                   She sees gulls in the sky. After a dislocating jump shot, the                   woman reaches for roots that are embedded in the cliff-like                   edge where the land goes from beach to vegetation. She pulls                   herself upwards through exposed tree roots. We see close-ups                   of her face framed by gnarled wood. She reaches a plateau, but                   as she climbs over its edge, it is a long dining table in a                   room. </p>                <p class="second"> Inside she sees seated men and women in suits                   and dresses, smoking and talking. We see her feet rise from                   the driftwood to the table and she begins crawling. As she crawls,                   the front of her body returns to nature as she pushes through                   plants. In other shots, visually continuous through her forward                   motion, she is on the table being ignored by the party guests.                   These shots alternate between wild plant life and the table                   until she reaches the end of the table, where a game of chess                   is being played by a man. The people leave the table and the                   chess pieces move by themselves until one piece drops through                   rock formations on the beach into a small waterfall. The protagonist                   follows the piece, but it is carried away by water. </p>                <p class="second"> We cut to a new scene. On a dirt road of two                   parallel paths formed by tire tracks in the grassy sand, the                   woman walks towards the camera. A man walks parallel to her                   and they talk, but as the camera cuts back and forth between                   the walkers, the man changes (film critic Parker Tyler, musician                   John Cage, filmmaker Alexander Hammid). The walkers go through                   branches and the man walks ahead. The woman tries to catch up                   to him but he goes into a ramshackle wood cabin and closes the                   door before she can reach it. She crawls in through an opening                   underneath the cabin. </p>                <p class="second"> Inside there is a room that does not fit the                   outside of the building. It is filled with furniture draped                   in white sheets. The woman sees a different man in a chair wrapped                   to his chin in drapery. He watches her, but seems immobile.                   She drops a cat and walks through doors that seem to meet in                   a corner-like maze. Going through the last of the doors leads                   her to the rocky, vertical edge of the beach. She jumps up to                   climb, but then crawls down backwards in slow-motion and seems                   to slide and fall between crevices. Overhead she sees a wooden                   scaffold-like lookout tower. </p>                <p class="second"> The woman is on the sandy beach and walks over                   dunes to the left. She diminishes in scale becoming an abstract                   vertical line. The camera pans overhead looking down on her                   vertically from a bird&#8217;s-eye-view. From there cut to a                   pan parallel to her as she walks and bends over picking up rocks                   and dropping them. She looks backwards and sees two women with                   long hair, a blonde and a brunette, playing chess at the edge                   of the water. She moves near them and watches them, but they                   don&#8217;t seem to see her. They chat and smile. </p>                <p class="second">Suddenly the chess opponents are on the same                   side of the board and the protagonist is behind them. She strokes                   their hair and they bend their heads back, smiling as they continue                   to play. The watcher grabs a chess piece and then runs as her                   double watches her and another double is still trying to gather                   rocks. The woman with the captured chess piece runs over the                   dunes with her arms bent at the elbows and forearms up in the                   air. As she runs, it cuts to her moving through trees. The film                   cuts to the room where she crawls on the table, then to her                   footprints along the beach, then to her running. She becomes                   small again and disappears in the distance to the right.</p>                <p class="second"> Now that we have a linear &#8220;horizontal&#8221;                   framework on which to overlay meaning, we can proceed with some                   &#8220;vertical&#8221; associations, mindful that the horizontal                   effect of memory can interject plot connections simultaneously.                   As in all interpretation, this cannot be a &#8220;closed&#8221;                   reading, especially since Deren consciously leaves room for                   ambiguity and interpretative play. But as an interpretation,                   it can point to how Deren wanted her films to be seen.<br>                  According to Andrews, since the Enlightenment landscape has                   had strong cultural meanings.[21] Deren uses these meanings                   and often contradicts our expectations of them to create an                   effect. The woman on the beach is washed to shore like the classical                   goddess Venus. The sensuality of these shots support such an                   allusion. With such classical associations, we assume that there                   might be other pastoral allusions to love and nature&#8212;the                   beach as a secure, open space freed from the tyranny of the                   ocean, the landscape as primal and creative space, as spiritually                   and morally regenerative. There does seem to be an intimacy                   with nature in the first scene in which the body and its physicality                   seem free from modern urban alienation. Nature seems simple,                   direct and unmediated by culture. The landscape is generalized                   and might be imaginary though it was actually shot at Port Jefferson,                   Long Island.[22] These first shots suggest what Andrews calls                   the essentialist view of landscape&#8212;nature as transcendental                   and common experience, where both natural and female beauty                   are absolute. </p>                <p class="second"> Deren, however, then challenges these landscape                   traditions. The waves reverse as if something is not right with                   the laws of nature. There is disorientation. A look of intensity                   on the woman&#8217;s face counters the collapsed sensuality                   of her body and suddenly she is dislocated through a jump-cut                   into a physical task, which though still makes her look beautiful,                   begins to seem threatening to her. Most of these images suggest                   that outer and inner geography are being juxtaposed in some                   strange balance. In some ways the camera work in At Land explores                   the female body as abstracted form as in the work of Edward                   Weston&#8217;s still photography (but without the nudity). </p>                <p class="second"> Another dislocation is that the intensity of                   the ocean shots is thwarted by another filmic choice, the silence                   of the film. The waves crash, but we hear nothing; allowing                   for exclusive focus on visual patterns. Sound is formal element                   that is a difficult to control, and one that tends to subliminally                   dominate visual form, something Deren would not have favored.                   One is reminded of the importance of silence, dissonance and                   intervals in the music of John Cage, who appears briefly in                   the film and would later work on musical &#8220;landscapes.&#8221;[23]                   That people in music, art, literature, dance and film all refer                   to concepts of landscape in their work in the 1940s and 1950s                   suggests the prevalence of landscape as a conceptual artistic                   paradigm. </p>                <p class="second"> This landscape sequence in <em>At Land</em>                   suggests both inner (interior to the body) and outer (exterior                   to the body) geography, but this is further complicated by introducing                   the table and interior in which the party is taking place. The                   landscape is contrasted with the social scene; an interior which                   confuses inside and outside. While the woman&#8217;s unacknowledged                   presence suggests an inner state of social alienation, she also                   inhabits her body more fully than anyone in the room (as evidenced                   by her crawling&#8212;a sort of primal movement before walking).                 </p>                <p class="second"> Deren later wrote that she wanted the crawling                   to look as if she were underwater and that she was trying to                   swim through air.[24] Deren also loved cats, identified with                   them, and observed them enough to help Hammid make a documentary                   on their pets, <em>The Private Life of a Cat</em> (1945). As                   someone interested in bodily motion, Deren used the mobility                   of cats as a model, and this can be seen in how she moves in                   <em>At Land</em>, especially when her movements are accentuated                   by slow-motion.</p>                <p class="second"> The crawling in <em>At Land</em> is also similar                   to the dislocated motion that Jean Cocteau&#8217;s artist/poet                   experiences in <em>Blood of the Poet</em> (1930) when the artist                   crawls along a corridor of rooms. We know that Deren liked this                   film and its imaginative treatment of the artist&#8217;s journey                   and sacrifice.[25] Deren&#8217;s crawl is different from that                   of Cocteau&#8217;s character in that we do not identify the                   woman as an artist and she alternates back and forth between                   landscape/nature and the room interior. While both of these                   protagonists observe others, Deren&#8217;s is more interactive                   because of her dislocations. Throughout the protagonist&#8217;s                   crawl in <em>At Land</em>, she remains the most conscious of                   anyone in the film. Almost everyone else seems oblivious to                   the environment and to her. Landscape and the room both seem                   to signify inner/outer states, and perhaps another state that                   is both inner and outer, that of the voyeur. Only the protagonist                   in <em>At Land</em> adjusts her actions accordingly.</p>                <p class="second"> At the end of the table, after crawling through                   societal ritual of the dinner party, we come to another ritual&#8212;the                   game of chess. Deren saw games as a type of ritual in which                   people play and form social bonds. She probably also knew that                   chess is an old game that originated in India. She knew Marcel                   Duchamp and his love of the game.[26] She admired his <em>Anemic                   Cinema</em> (1925-26) and had worked on a film which she never                   finished, <em>Witch&#8217;s Cradle</em> (1943) about Duchamp&#8217;s                   installation of string at the 1942 &#8220;Art of This Century&#8221;                   Surrealist exhibition. </p>                <p class="second"> The chess game/piece in <em>At Land</em> perhaps                   refers to the protagonist&#8217;s longing to be included, to                   play along and to be a part of social rituals that slip from                   her grasp. When she finally does obtain the piece by stealing,                   the act forces her away from others. The mobility of Deren&#8217;s                   protagonist is opposite that of the piece representing the king                   whose mobility is limited and is the prize of the game. In the                   film the woman pursues and obtains a queen with lesser status                   and more mobility than the king. Tim Cresswell and Deborah Dixon                   see mobility as an element of identity in the play of power                   and meaning within social and cultural networks of meaning,                   and this fits the context of <em>At Land</em>.[27]</p>                <p class="second"> The journey of Deren&#8217;s protagonist, partly                   in pursuit of the chess piece, takes place through another landscape                   tradition&#8212;the walk through nature. German romantics considered                   walking in landscape an experience of the relationship between                   the social and nature, exactly what the protagonist seems to                   be experiencing in Deren&#8217;s walk alongside a man (or men).[28]                   Think how walks continue to be rituals of experiencing nature,                   whether in parks or on hiking trips. Walks also remain rituals                   of courtship, suggesting privacy and freedom from social constraints                   and act as public declarations of commitment and mutual attraction.                   In Deren&#8217;s film, the walking woman on the path is equal                   to the man, but as she pursues him, he lures her to an interior                   where she finds a more paternal-looking and immobile man. Her                   other walks on the beach are more solitary, and equally frustrating,                   as when she picks up rocks, or exhilarating, as when she walks/runs                   over the dunes.</p>                <p class="second"> When the protagonist is in the draped room,                   she leaves through a maze-like corner set of doors. This walk                   through a door that steps out onto a beach recalls the ending                   of the Dal&iacute;/Bu&ntilde;uel film, <em>Un Chien Andalou</em>                   (1928-29) where the female lead also steps out on to a beach.                   In that film, filled with Freudian symbols that Deren would                   have disliked&#8212;she believed psychoanalysis was a system                   alien to art that demystified it&#8212;the beach scene symbolizes                   the &#8220;little death&#8221; of orgasm destroying desire.[29]                   As we have already seen, the beach in <em>At Land</em> is much                   more open-ended in meaning and attempts to represent conscious                   states.</p>                <p class="second"> Once back to the beach, the protagonist is                   threatened by a backward fall in slow motion much as Cocteau&#8217;s                   poet retraces his gravity-free crawl from his imagination back                   to the reality of his studio. The woman in <em>At Land</em>                   loses control of her mobility and is given over to gravity,                   which drops her back to the beach where she again walks, but                   this time over the dunes. In <em>At Land</em> the woman becomes                   a sort of female flaneur, transported from an urban context                   to that of a landscape. She tries to pick up stones, as one                   often collects pebbles or shells on the beach&#8212;again a                   sort of ritual. But in the film the task has an elemental, almost                   Sisyphusean quality because the stones are too large and she                   cannot hold them all, though she keeps trying until the very                   end.</p>                <p class="second"> When the protagonist sees the chess game again,                   two women are playing&#8212;whereas at the table there was a                   single man&#8212;and the protagonist is more comfortable and                   in control. She even makes contact with them by stroking their                   hair, although they don&#8217;t speak. The sensuousness seems                   to take them off guard and the observing woman captures the                   white queen, which by this time possesses a talisman-like quality.                   The protagonist is victorious and runs away like a child taking                   candy, but an insecurity remains because she watches herself                   in the form of a double and she sees another double picking                   up stones. </p>                <p class="second"> If we do not interpret the doubles as the Freudian                   uncanny, as is typical now, we are left to think of them as                   simultaneous and as relating to memory and the motion of time.                   This triple appearance of the self is a prime example of Deren&#8217;s                   horizontal and vertical motion combining with each other. Lauren                   Rabinowitz sees the multiple selves here as occupying contiguous                   spaces rather than the same space as in <em>Meshes</em>, implying                   that the protagonist represents a woman in relation to her self.[30]</p>                <p class="second"> As the woman runs away, and we recall her running                   away earlier in the film in a different direction, she rises                   her arms like a dancing figure on an ancient Greek vase. As                   we relive her past and present, we are left to wonder whether                   she is running away from the realities of her experience or                   towards an integrated self, perhaps both impossibilities in                   this film&#8217;s context. Identity formation in <em>At Land</em>                   is more entropic and fluid. As something is added, something                   else falls away, like the stones the protagonist tries to gather,                   like the natural processes of geology.</p>                <p class="second"> Throughout <em>At Land</em> Deren reconfigures                   ideas of landscape, giving us a new vision of what a cinematic                   landscape might be. Situating the woman in a natural environment                   impacts on nature. She makes footprints, gathers stones, and                   moves through the environment, sometimes as a free agent and                   sometimes as a reactionary one. She is conscious of the place                   and of nature changing around her and she acts accordingly.                   It is difficult to tell if she is conscious of the effect of                   her actions on her self or on others.</p>                <p class="second"> For Deren the traditional landscape representing                   a natural order is subverted and made creative by breaking through                   formal contexts such as dislocations in time, space and expectations.                   Landscape transforms as a place of energy and change much as                   in the romantic landscapes of Turner.[31] Deren&#8217;s geography                   triggers daydreams and lost of self, but identity keeps interpenetrating                   these realities. By avoiding character and plot motivation,                   sensuality is depersonalized and somewhat de-eroticized. Culture                   and nature seem to reinforce, rather than oppose, each other.                   The masculine sublime is so mixed with the feminine picturesque                   that the representation of nature becomes androgynous. <br>                  Nature is not threatening, but it is sometimes wild and uncontrollable.                   The protagonist is not punished for her sensuality or her social                   transgressions. Men are present, but are not very powerful or                   controlling, often due to their lack of mobility. Men do not                   visit the beach; they are only on the parallel road and usually                   inside or going inside rooms filled with furniture. There are                   no words spoken on the beach, and even if people speak on the                   road or at the party, we cannot hear them. It is as if nature                   has made speech impotent. No music romanticizes the forms and                   patterns of nature. </p>                <p class="second"> The deep space of the landscape offers the                   protagonist the ineffable power of running away, of escape towards                   change. Landscape offers a spatial alternative to the claustrophobic                   rooms of social relationships and conventions, but the landscape                   is not without social contact and not without the environmental                   reality of the self. Landscape functions as a spatial labyrinth                   or maze through which the self wanders, reminding us of Theseus,                   and Picasso&#8217;s obsession with the minotaur as self.</p>                <p class="second"> <em>At Land</em> was made during World War                   II, a war fought through the natural boundaries of air, land                   and sea. Landings and battles on beaches were common, especially                   in the Pacific, but also on D-Day.[32] In the film Deren is                   washed ashore and crawls like someone invading a space, even                   though she seems somewhat lost. The title and context of the                   film suggests that one can be as bewildered on land as &#8220;at                   sea.&#8221;[33] In the film, the beach is an edge or place of                   transition, a site where nature and the social interact, where                   transitions may not be merely personal but larger in scope.                   Countries are often delimited by their natural coastlines. The                   ocean and the sky there also imply infinity and a cosmological                   significance. <br>                  The experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage, who knew Deren, complimented                   her on how she could manipulate film and meaning in a way that                   seems fresh and natural.32 Her manipulations never seem like                   tricks or special effects, even after repeated viewing. I think                   that her theory of art and nature and her distinctions in defining                   art and science allowed her to integrate nature as a model into                   her work in a way that withstands critical thinking. Representations                   of landscape are not something outmoded and sentimental. Nor                   are they limited to earth works and environmental works. The                   cinematic landscape is a rich system of meaning that continues                   to inform who we are and how we see our place in the world in                   both experimental film and popular cinema. As we have seen in                   Deren&#8217;s &#8220;mythological voyage of the twentieth century,&#8221;                   the representation of landscape is a subject of innovation,                   tradition and fascination.[34]</p>                <p class="second">&nbsp; </p>                </td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;         2004 P<i>ART</i> and John Kaufman.
