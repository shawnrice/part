Despite the abundance of literature that exists regarding the                   career of Louis Comfort Tiffany, little serious attention has                   been paid thus far to his work in mosaic. This is in no small                   part determined by public perception of mosaic as an art form:                   dry, Byzantine and most often associated with ecclesiastical                   settings. Certainly the bulk of Tiffany&#8217;s work in this                   medium tends to confirm these impressions. The vast majority                   of his works in mosaic tend to be either located in churches,                   or else mimic the flattened Byzantine format despite their secular                   placement and themes. However, a small body of Tiffany's work                   radically broke with this tradition and sought, for the first                   time, to endow the medium with a sense of pictorial depth by                   experimenting with both linear and atmospheric perspective.                   The culmination of these experiments is evident in <em>The Dream                   Garden</em> mosaic [figure 1], installed in the Curtis Building                   in Philadelphia in 1916, about which Tiffany stated:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p> I trust it may stand in the years to come for a development                     in glassmaking and its application to art which will give                     to students a feeling that in this year of nineteen hundred                     and fifteen something worthy has been produced for the benefit                     of mankind, and that it may serve as an incentive for others                     to carry even further the true mission of mosaic. [1]</p>                </blockquote>                <p> Although his work in mosaic dated back to 1889 with the interior                   design for the Havemeyer House, it is in the first two decades                   of the twentieth century that Tiffany seemed to solidify an                   artistic vision for mosaics based upon a faithful rendering                   of pictorial space. <em>The Garden Landscape and Fountain</em>                   (1905-15) at The Metropolitan Museum of Art [figure 2], and                   the <em>Mosaic Curtain</em> for the Mexican National Theatre                   (1911) [figure 3], two extant commissions which preceded <em>The                   Dream Garden</em>, can be used to trace this trajectory, demonstrating                   a continued reliance on the modernization of materials even                   while preserving a fervently anti-modern aesthetic sensibility.</p>                <p> One of the difficulties in examining any aspect of Tiffany&#8217;s                   career in terms of modernity is the inherent contradiction created                   by his revolutionary exploration of materials when compared                   to his rather conservative employment of them. His artistic                   career, which spanned six decades and saw numerous developments                   in the arts, remained almost anachronistically singular in its                   concerns. This longevity is the source, in many ways, of the                   tension between innovation and conservatism one finds in his                   oeuvre. What seemed an inspired, fresh approach to interiors                   and the materials used within them in the middle of the 1870s                   had, by the 1910s, become pass&eacute; and regressive. The opulence                   of the aesthetic movement and its concern for color, pattern                   and texture remained a hallmark of Tiffany&#8217;s style despite                   the changing artistic environment around him. Tiffany&#8217;s                   artistic vision, as Martin Eidelberg has noted, &#8220;was firmly                   rooted in the historic revivalism which dominated much of mid-nineteenth-century                   design&#8230;inspiration [was] drawn from the experience of                   past European styles and from foreign cultures.&#8221;[2] Rather                   than adapt and respond to emerging modernity in the United States                   and abroad Tiffany seemed remarkably unfazed by the developments,                   although at times he decried them. A notable example is his                   1895 commission by Siegfried Bing to translate one painting                   each by artists Bonnard, Vuillard, Toulouse Lautrec and Ranson                   into glass. Despite the completion of these windows, there is                   no discernable visual impact on Tiffany&#8217;s style, or in                   the productions of his staff.[3] Rather, he continued in the                   same vein, unmoved and unchanged by the art world around him.                   Beyond merely being attributable to his age or wealth, Tiffany&#8217;s                   rejection of modernism clearly relates to the aesthetic vision                   he had forged for himself during the early part of his career.                   Returning from Paris in 1913, for example, he stated, &#8220;the                   cubists are hammering away, but I think they will peter out,&#8221;[4]                   and later in the Evening Telegraph noted &#8220;they call it                   modern because it can&#8217;t be called art.&#8221;[5] Even                   the success of other glass artists at the turn of the century,                   like Blanche Ostertag and Orlando Giannini, whose Japonisme-tinged                   mosaic work garnered them critical acclaim at the Chicago Architectural                   Club exhibition of 1900, had no noticeable impact on Tiffany's                   work. He retained the sensibilities of the aesthetic era far                   longer than other artists of his time and rejected the penchant                   for flatness and two-dimensionality that modernism embraced.                 </p>                <p> The significant development that preceded and enabled these                   mosaics was Tiffany&#8217;s advancements in rendering perspective                   and atmosphere in stained-glass windows. His mastery of perspective                   in his landscape or ecclesiastical windows should be seen along                   the continuum of his experimentation in glass and constant desire                   to advance the medium. Aside from their material construction,                   the two mediums have little in common in terms of technique.                   At the time Tiffany began experimenting with glass, in fact,                   landscapes were believed to be a wholly unsuitable subject for                   that medium. As <em>Harper&#8217;s New Monthly Magazine</em>                   noted in 1879:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p> A glass-painting is incapable of those nice gradations of                     color and of light and shade which are indispensable for close                     imitations of nature, and for producing the full effect of                     atmosphere and distance. And even if this defect could be                     overcome, the lead and metal work would infallably ruin the                     picture. For these reasons it would be improper to select                     landscape, for instance, as the principal subject of a glass-painting.[6]</p>                </blockquote>                <p> It was not a foregone conclusion that issues of perspective                   would be solved; rather, it should be understood that Tiffany                   was working to explore the full potential of the glass, relentlessly                   transforming the material and adapting its compositional possibilities.                   It is his spirit of inventiveness, rather than any particular                   achievement in window making, that should be emphasized. By                   1899, for instance an art reviewer from the <em>New York Times</em>                   visiting the exhibition of Favrile glass at Tiffany&#8217;s                   New York Showroom noted that &#8220;some of the windows done                   in this glass as well as some of the other objects shown, have                   a play of color and a transparency and vitality which are remarkable.                   The windows in particular have really the effect of beautiful                   paintings, and in distance, atmosphere and color are hardly                   surpassed by the products of the brush.&#8221;[7] The main obstacle,                   however, in rendering perspective in mosaic, is the lack of                   plating or overlapping of segments that is possible in the windows.                   This trait is well illustrated by Tiffany's window <em>Magnolia                   and Irises</em> (c. 1908) at The Metropolitan Museum of Art,                   in which he softened the outline of the mountain by placing                   the leading behind the primary glass of the pictorial plane.                   The magnolia blossoms, which seem to flutter on the branches,                   are the result of folded and manipulated glass. These blossoms,                   made from sheets of glass worked as it is cooling, project from                   the plane of the image&#8212;a trait that is not appropriate                   for mosaic. </p>                <p> While Tiffany demonstrated a willingness to defy the prevailing                   attitudes regarding the suitability of glass to landscape subjects                   in his landscape windows of the late 1890s and early 1900s,                   it is within the glass vessels of this period that he developed                   the formal vocabulary necessary to execute this vision. The                   arrival of Arthur John Nash in 1892 and the subsequent construction                   of the Tiffany Furnaces in Corona, Long Island shortly thereafter                   heralded a new era in Tiffany&#8217;s glass production that                   led to the development of his trademark Favrile glass. [8] Nash                   was a talented artisan who had been chief designer and manager                   of White House Glass Works in Wordsley, England beginning c.1875-80;                   he later joined Dennis Glass works c.1887-90. It is in this                   time period, in February 1892, that Tiffany dissolved Louis                   C. Tiffany, Incorporated and formed Tiffany Glass and Decorating                   Company. The shift in manufacturing to Favrile glass in 1893                   under the stewardship of Arthur J. Nash resulted in a radical                   new material whose possibilities changed the design of Tiffany                   mosaics. As a company brochure suggested, &#8220;through its                   limitless range of color, diversity of tone and endless variety                   of texture&#8230;this new glass&#8230; is particularly and peculiarly                   fitted for windows and mosaics.&#8221;[9] As the firm clearly                   acknowledged, &#8220;Tiffany Favrile Glass not only complies                   with every condition required in mosaic work, but it goes further                   and furnishes the mosaicist with an unlimited range of colors,                   so that he never has to resort, like the workers of old, to                   contrasting colors in order to supply the deficiency of his                   palette.&#8221;[10] By broadening the spectrum of color available,                   Tiffany&#8217;s new glass expanded the compositional and illusionistic                   options that could be executed within the medium.</p>                <p> The first tangible evidence of these developments evident                   in mosaic occurs in his <em>Garden Landscape and Fountain</em>                   which the Metropolitan Museum has dated between 1905-15. Despite                   the uncertainty in dating that the ten-year range implies, it                   would seem that this example is stylistically the earliest,                   and served as a precursor to the larger commissions to follow.                   The <em>Garden Landscape</em> explored pictorial space in a                   new way precisely because Tiffany was actively exploring the                   tonal and textural possibilities of his Favrile glass. As the                   writer H. L. Vivian noted, &#8220;Mr. Tiffany, in the making                   of Favrile glass, has achieved the delicate colours for glass                   mosaic demanded by modern taste, so that we have now a magnificent                   series of pinks, greys, grey-blues, greenish yellow and yellow.                   These tones were impossible to reproduce in the old mosaics                   where only the primary colours were used.&#8221;[11] Tiffany                   exploited the three main characteristics of his glass: clarity,                   color and surface, thus expanding the pictorial possibilities                   of the medium. The border for the fountain [figure 4] provides                   a remarkably clear illustration of these features and of the                   effects that are possible by altering them. Clarity as a feature                   gives the glass a sense of depth that recedes into the picture                   plane. One looks through the square, clear tesserae and notice                   the variation and texture of the gold foil that backs each piece.                   The clear casing over the gold gives a sense of depth to the                   color that is markedly different from the milky-green opalescent                   sections that surround them. These tesserae are pure color,                   and seem to sit on the plane of the picture, offering a neutral                   environment that neither pulls into the wall nor comes off of                   it. By contrast, the iridescence of the pieces surrounding the                   central squares actively asserts a sense of surface. The metallic                   glazes create a spatial illusion that draws these tones away                   from the picture plane and activates the surface when lit. </p>                <p> For some, though, the reliance on material detracted from                   the artistry of the creation. As critic and rival mosaicist                   Charles Rollinson Lamb noted, &#8220;as much as we may admire                   the beauty of the glass, the artistic use of it by the designer                   is the main thing to be considered. What should we think of                   a painter who should lay more emphasis on the grinding of his                   pigments than upon the composition of his picture?&#8221;[12]                   Professional rivalries aside, it is clear that Tiffany&#8217;s                   emphasis on the primacy of glass to the composition enabled                   him to achieve effects that were unavailable to artisans using                   lesser materials. By altering the combinations of these three                   traits - color, clarity and surface - Tiffany was able to realize                   a sense of pictorial illusion and atmospheric perspective previously                   unattained in mosaic.<br>                  Tiffany&#8217;s next major landscape mosaic, the <em>Mosaic                   Theater Curtain</em> (1911) for the Mexican National Theater,                   built upon the developments of the Garden Landscape and expanded                   them to a much larger scale. Not only was the physical size                   of the commission increased, but the expanded pictorial space                   allowed for a more dramatic representation of linear and atmospheric                   perspective. Instead of the shallow, measured recession into                   space evident in the <em>Garden Landscape</em>, one finds a                   foreground with fir trees &#8220;in bold relief&#8221; and colorful                   leaves of Bouganvillia and Aralia, which Tiffany insisted created                   a &#8220;picture truthfully portraying the charm of the country.&#8221;[13]                   The middle ground was essentially a void, and vast characterless                   plains lead the viewers&#8217; eyes into the volcanoes in the                   distance. Depth was achieved by a softening of line and a reduction                   of color intensity. The quality of illusionistic depth that                   Favrile Glass could render allowed it, Tiffany Studios claimed,                   not only to equal but to surpass in effect the art of painting.                   As the studio&#8217;s promotional pamphlet suggested:</p>                <blockquote>                  <p> On viewing the curtain the spectator is impressed with the                     deftness of the artisans at the studios who executed this                     poem in glass. The minutest details, such as the stem of a                     flower or the needle of a fir tree are as realistically pictured                     as the glistening sides of the snow covered mountains. The                     completed curtain illustrates the decorative and ornamental                     possibilities of the Tiffany Favrile Glass. Its opalescence,                     iridescence, and the beauty of its finish lend a touch of                     reality to landscape scenes and pictures of natural beauty                     that cannot be obtained as effectively through other mediums.[14]</p>                </blockquote>                <p> The curtain was displayed in Tiffany Studio&#8217;s New York                   showroom before it was shipped, where critics praised the effects                   not only of the glass, but of the artistry of the execution                   as well. A reviewer from <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>                   noted: &#8220;The artists who made the studies for the final                   composition are to be congratulated for the result of their                   labors. The picture, regarded simply as a decoration, irrespective                   of the feats of Craftsmanship involved, having great beauty                   and a moving quality of color.&#8221;[15] In addition, the segmented                   bronze work, which mimicked the effect of window mullions, further                   reinforced the notion of gazing into a picturesque landscape.                   Considering both the physical distance at which the audience                   was placed and the sharp break between the foreground and background                   compositional elements, the <em>Mosaic Theater Curtain</em>                   emphasized a very traditional idea of pictorial space in which                   the composition broke through the wall and became a window onto                   the outside world. Leslie Nash, who managed the Furnaces after                   his father Arthur John Nash, noted that &#8220;the curtain was                   so important to us that no book on Favrile glass could be written                   without mention of it.&#8221;[16]</p>                <p> Despite its smaller size of forty-nine feet by sixteen feet,                   <em>The Dream Garden</em>, installed in 1916 in the Curtis Building,                   Philadelphia, represented the culmination of Tiffany&#8217;s                   experiment with perspectival space in mosaic. Though the success                   of the project was paramount in Tiffany&#8217;s mind, the commission                   of the mosaic had more to do with providence than preference.                   During the construction of the building, the architect had originally                   consulted muralist Edwin A. Abbey, notable for his <em>Quest                   for the Holy Grail</em> (1890-1902) in the Boston Public Library,                   and commissioned him to decorate the entrance space.[17] Abbey                   had &#8220;selected his subject, made his preliminary studies,                   and was about to begin work on a mural when his death occurred.&#8221;[18]                   Maxfield Parrish, who was completing murals in the upper floors                   of the building and whose work was regularly featured in Curtis                   publications, was asked to undertake the commission but refused                   because of time constraints. It was eventually agreed that he                   would provide a small painting, which would then be executed                   in glass mosaic by Tiffany Studios. The successful exhibition                   and subsequent critical acclaim of the <em>Mosaic Theatre Curtain</em>                   were the determining factors in awarding the commission. As                   the company noted, &#8220;The exhibition of the curtain called                   forth expressions of the greatest enthusiasm from the artists                   and connoisseurs who saw it&#8230;here, then, obviously, was                   the solution to the difficulty which the mural had seemed to                   present to the Directors of the Curtis Publishing Company.&#8221;[19]                   The firing of the glass and construction of the mosaic continued                   from 1915 into 1916 and was supervised by Tiffany himself and                   his assistant Joseph Briggs.[20]</p>                <p> <em>The Dream Garden</em> represented for Tiffany the culmination                   of the poetic possibilities of glass mosaic, achieved through                   both relentless experimentation in the medium and a singular                   focus on creating illusionistic space. Ironically, while the                   previous examples of this trend were the result of Tiffany&#8217;s                   own artistic sensibility, or those of his studio, <em>The Dream                   Garden</em>&#8217;s success is inevitably linked to Maxfield                   Parrish&#8217;s style and its suitability to the medium. The                   hard lines and photographic quality of Parrish&#8217;s painting                   in conjunction with his penchant for glowing color made Favrile                   glass mosaic the perfect vehicle for <em>The Dream Garden</em>&#8217;s                   execution. In addition, the formal qualities of the work, such                   as the highly-detailed foreground and sweeping recession into                   space, mirrored the Mosaic Curtain&#8217;s composition and allowed                   Tiffany to readdress similar formal issues. However, unlike                   the <em>Mosaic Curtain</em>, <em>The Dream Garden</em>&#8217;s                   effect was predicated not merely on the imitation of nature                   but on endowing nature with romantic, glowing color. The combination                   of the romantic and realistic sensibilities of the mosaic were                   particularly pronounced when Tiffany displayed the work in his                   studios before it was installed in Philadelphia. As one reviewer                   noted, &#8220;one sits in the darkness to observe it, and the                   light behind the spectator is gradually increased until dawn                   is changed to noonday, then to late afternoon, then to moonlit                   night&#8230;The textures are all closely imitated, and, of course                   the changing light gives as in theatrical lighting the illusion                   of reality.&#8221;[21] These realistic effects were further                   heightened by a more complex and technically proficient handling                   of the glass. </p>                <p> While Tiffany had manufactured glass specifically for the                   <em>Mosaic Theater Curtain</em>, it is in <em>The Dream Garden</em>                   that these innovations come to fruition and crystallize the                   meeting of technical proficiency and artistic vision that remains                   the hallmark of the landscape mosaics. Each tesserae and sectilae                   performed distinct functions; creating optical illusions which                   represented material forms, mimicked the effects of atmosphere,                   and indicated the change of light across the scene. Whereas                   in the <em>Garden Landscape Fountain</em> Tiffany relied on                   segmented sectiliae for the blossoms of flowers, <em>The Dream                   Garden</em> featured numerous multi-colored blossoms constructed                   from a single piece of glass. [figure 5] Utilizing the &#8216;paperweight&#8217;                   technique, which he had employed in his blown glass since the                   late 1890s, [figure 6] Tiffany was able to construct individual                   blossoms full of veining and shading without having to place                   mortar lines within the flower. At the left-hand side of the                   mosaic, the iridescent blue glass creates a pool of water which                   shimmers behind the plant forms, each leaf mottled and varied                   with hues ranging from an olive green to a deep red. Tiffany&#8217;s                   sensitivity to the effects of the color and texture of the glass                   are likewise evident in the construction of the main tree, whose                   branches reach convincingly back into the pictorial space&#8212;demonstrating                   a sense of recession and of volume not fully realized in his                   other landscape mosaics. The use of small sectilae among the                   branches allowed Tiffany to vary the orientation of the pieces                   as well as the color in order to create unparalleled effects                   of texture and shading which heightened the sense of pictorial                   depth. [figure 7] The same strategy can be seen in the distant                   mountains, whose varied color and complex structuring create                   the effect of the sun setting over jagged rocks. While color                   is the primary indicator of the position of the rocks, the varied                   pattern of the sectilae within both the light and dark sections                   of the mountains further amplifies the sense of structure within                   these color-fields. In addition to altering both the structure                   and color of the sectilae within the flowing water in the right-hand                   side of the mosaic, Tiffany manipulated the iridescence of the                   glass to create the impression of mist.[figure 8] This carefully                   crafted detail, created by changing both the color of the glass                   and its surface effect, lends further credence to the illusion                   of depth by allowing the viewer to look through the effervescence                   of the atmosphere to the solid forms of the rocks behind. </p>                <p> While the commission clearly demonstrates the peculiarly anti-modern                   aesthetic impulses of Tiffany Studios, it also serves to highlight                   their technical achievements in glass color, and in rendering                   pictorial depth. The New York Times stated that:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p> as a phase in the development in modern taste it cannot                     fail to be interesting. It is interesting, too, to reflect                     that so special and technical art as that practiced with the                     medium of glass should within our own generation have run                     the scale from the medieval type as shown in such work as                     Miss Armstrong did for the windows in Mrs. Belmont&#8217;s                     armory, through the La Farge glass to this amazing realism                     at the Tiffany Studios&#8230;[22]</p>                </blockquote>                <p> The commission would prove to be the last landscape mosaic                   Tiffany executed and signified the culmination of his vision.                   Changing artistic trends, the outbreak of World War One, the                   subsequent decline of opportunities for such work, as well as                   his advancing age were likely factors that forced this cessation.                   Bankruptcy, a reduction in innovation and the general sense                   that perhaps he had outlived his artistic relevance marked his                   later years, and his death in 1933 precipitated the closing                   of his remaining industries.</p>                <p class="maintext"> Although Tiffany has been frequently aligned                   with Art Nouveau and an emerging modern sensibility, this relationship                   is tenuous at best, and ignores substantial parts of Tiffany's                   oeuvre in order to secure an American artist&#8217;s place within                   the cannon of early modern design.[23] As these mosaics demonstrate,                   Tiffany&#8217;s predilections turned more to the mimicry of                   nature than to an abstraction of line and form.[24] His continued                   innovation in glass was tempered either by a relianc<span class="maintext">e                   on historical models, as seen in his early interiors and windows,                   or by the fidelity to nature one witnesses in his later windows                   and landscape mosaics. The artistic impulses that informed <em>The                   Dream Garden</em> were decidedly anti-modern and rejected whole-heartedly                   the dominant aesthetics that had emerged in C&eacute;zanne&#8217;s                   wake for nearly two decades. In reexamining these often-neglected                   works, a more precise picture of Tiffany&#8217;s artistic ambitions                   emerges which, despite its contradictions, is instructive in                   illustrating the full scope of artistic expression possible                   within the early modernist period. For patron and artist alike,                   <em>The Dream Garden</em> represented a physical and aesthetic                   retreat from the frenetic pace of the modern world.</span></p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p class="maintext"><a href="clancy_notes.html" class="linkbody">Sources&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p class="maintext"><a href="clancy_bio.html" class="linkbody">Author's                   Bio&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p>&nbsp; </p></td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center">          <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../index.html">P<em>ART</em></a></font><a href="../index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            home </font></a></p>          </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>      <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;         2004 P<i>ART</i> and Jonathan Clancy.
