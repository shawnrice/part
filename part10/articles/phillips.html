This paper will                   investigate the reasons the Inka may have constructed such frames,                   positing politico-religious functions that directed one&#8217;s                   gaze to the sacred or elite, protected or segregated the viewer                   and/or reinforced power relations between human and sacred realms.</p>                <table width="28%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="phillips_1.jpg" width="400" height="255"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Figure 1.

Here, one finds the longest and second                   highest mountain chain in the world, some of the world&#8217;s                   driest coastal deserts and dense tropical jungles. Distinct                   ecological zones, each producing its own set of goods and crops                   are packed so tightly together that in some areas several zones                   can be reached within one day&#8217;s walk.[1] Additionally,                   the Western Andes is prone to earthquakes, mudslides, flash                   floods and other natural disasters, making it a very difficult                   place to settle. Using political acumen and warfare, the Inka                   subjugated this large and culturally diverse area in only about                   one hundred years (c. 1430 - 1532) but were themselves conquered                   by the Spanish by the mid-sixteenth century.</p>                <table width="39%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="phillips_2.jpg" width="400" height="295"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Figure 2.

Archaeologists                   have found evidence of complex reciprocal trade relationships                   dating as far back as c. 2500 BC through midden and grave remains                   that originated from a variety of climactic zones. Dualistic                   imagery, seemingly stemming from this intense reciprocity, is                   commonly seen in even the earliest art forms of the Andes.[2]                   Reciprocal relationships, however, were not limited to people.                   Andean cosmology featured an animate and sacred landscape full                   of deities that demanded worship and offerings in exchange for                   such necessities as water, abundant crops and good health. Although                   early Andean culture did not employ an alphabetic writing system,                   scholars have found evidence of these reciprocal attitudes in                   artistic iconography. Early vessels, such as one Moche pot depicting                   an anthropomorphized mountain dripping with the blood of sacrificial                   victims, for example, illustrate Andean beliefs in reciprocity                   between deities and humans&#8212;in this case illustrating human                   sacrifices to mountain deities in return for abundant rain.</p>                <table width="34%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="phillips_map.jpg" width="270" height="400"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Map 1.

Though                   incorporating the various motives and biases of their authors,                   these works, written mainly in Spanish or in a combination of                   Quechua (Inka language) and Spanish, provide invaluable primary                   data, particularly regarding Inka religious practices and politics.[3]                   We know, for example, that the Inka believed in many gods that                   resided in or comprised the natural world. These deities were                   responsible for providing water and bountiful crops but could                   also cause such disasters as droughts, floods and earthquakes,                   if not venerated properly. Among the main deities were Viracocha,                   the Creator god, Inti, the Sun god, and Ilyap&#8217;a, the god                   of Thunder.[4] The ruler was believed to be the divine son of                   Inti and, as such, was both a political and sacred symbol.[5]                   Powerful warriors and highly effective negotiators, Inka rulers                   mobilized thousands of people to build vast road systems and                   state structures that altered the landscape. Not only did these                   constructions help facilitate state business but they served                   as visual reminders to the people of those who had political                   control. </p>                <p class="maintext">Similarly, frames as part of Inka elite constructions,                   likely pointed to the sacred while serving to remind one of                   the political power of those who put the frames in place. But                   could there have been other reasons for the frames? To explore                   the various possibilities of meaning of the frame, it is helpful                   to understand the significance of the &#8220;subject&#8221;                   being framed. Whether that which is framed is an object, a particular                   feature of the landscape or an elite personage, the very act                   of framing creates a relationship between subject and viewer.                   The choice of material used for both frame and framed may have                   also held significance to the Inka who held special regard for                   certain animate and inanimate objects.</p>                <p class="maintext">Stones, for example, played particularly important                   roles in Inka belief systems as they could be called suddenly                   to action to help their human counterparts, even turning into                   humans themselves. One story recounts rocks on a battlefield                   rising up as warriors at a particularly perilous moment in the                   fight to help the Inka soldiers defeat their enemy.[6] According                   to Susan Niles, &#8220;Origin myths tell of founding ancestors                   emerging from the earth, being converted to stone, and remaining                   for all time as tangible proof of the story.&#8221;[7] Rebecca                   Stone-Miller writes: </p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="maintext">The Inkas felt a special interchangeability                     with stones, believing them to be alive and able to transform                     into people and vice versa. . . . Inka stonework seems alive                     as it dynamically responds to natural formations, creates                     active surfaces, and dances in the strong light of the high-altitude                     sun. At the same time, this dynamic Inka feeling of identity                     with stone led them to manipulate stones, mountains, and streams                     toward imperial expressive ends. Being one with the earth,                     they proclaimed themselves able to construct cultural statements                     with its materials and preexisting forms. To geometricize,                     enhance, frame, and move people through the environment they                     subtly changed natural outlines.[8]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="maintext">Natural-looking boulders are the most frequent                   objects set within borders, while all extant Inka frames are                   made of rock. This may be an issue of preservation, however,                   as stone does not disintegrate as easily or quickly as organic                   materials, possibly distorting the surviving sample. Other factors                   may distort the data surrounding frames as well. There is no                   way of comparing how many frames were originally created to                   those that remain since natural phenomena and later human activity                   may have disrupted the placement of a frame. Another issue concerning                   the current framing sample lies in how some sites or features                   within these sites were later reconstructed. Despite these questions,                   it is valuable to analyze the frames that remain as important                   clues regarding their meaning may emerge that can be corroborated                   with other material findings or with historical descriptions                   that further our understanding of Inka world views.</p>                <table width="76%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="phillips_3.jpg" width="400" height="247"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Figure 3.

This site is striking                   for its location on top of a narrow mountain crag (Figure 4).                   The Sacred Rock was placed in the northern corner of Machu Picchu,                   visually near the taller peak of Huaynu Picchu to the north                   and the Yanantin mountain &#8220;behind&#8221; it to the northeast.                   (The &#8220;back&#8221; of the Sacred Rock faces almost due                   north.) At first glance the monument appears to be a large (approx.                   12&#8217; x 20&#8217; x 3&#8217;) natural boulder surrounded                   by a low-lying (approx. 3&#8217; x 25&#8217; x 1 1/2&#8217;)                   rectangular wall made of smaller, rough stones. However, the                   boulder was subtly manipulated to mimic the surrounding mountains.                   While the Yanantin mountain is almost always cloud-covered,                   when the clouds are lifted, one can see that the stone and mountain                   behind it look strikingly similar.</p>                <table width="30%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><div align="left"><img src="phillips_4.jpg" width="400" height="287"></div></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td><div align="left" class="maintext">Figure 4.

According to Johan Reinhard, mountain deities                   were particularly important to the Inka as they were responsible                   for providing rain and abundant crops. This is most likely why                   child mummies, sacrificed in special ceremonies, have been found                   on some of the highest mountain peaks in the Andes.[9] Identifying                   the significance of the Sacred Rock as a visual reminder, however,                   belies the pan-Andean tendency to emphasize an object&#8217;s                   essence rather than outward appearance. As Rebecca Stone-Miller                   has pointed out, this concept of essence explains why the Nazca                   Lines were too large to have been seen from the ground or why                   Inka and other Andean goldsmiths sometimes masked precious metals                   with pigment or other materials.[10]</p>                <p class="maintext">But if the signficance of the Sacred Rock                   was not to replace the hidden mountain, what other function                   could it have had? Perhaps another pan-Andean concept is applicable                   here--reciprocity. Given the emphasis on reciprocal relationships                   between communities and between people and gods, it seems reasonable                   that Andean artists wanted to create a monument that would illustrate                   the reciprocal relationship between humans and mountain deities.                   &#8220;Mountain stones,&#8221; such as the Sacred Rock, litter                   the site of Machu Picchu but none come close to its scale, and                   none other is framed. Why did the Inka artisans go to the trouble,                   then, of constructing this surrounding wall, particularly in                   the rugged terrain of a site like Machu Picchu? Could it have                   been a purely decorative choice? While this is possible, it                   is not likely as there are no other Inka examples of &#8220;mere                   aesthetics&#8221; and no mention of the concept of art as it                   exists in the West in any of the post-Conquest texts. The presence                   of the low-lying wall seems to point to the special character                   of the Sacred Rock itself. Perhaps it marks a special visual                   dialogue between stone and mountain,[11] or was produced as                   a way of commemorating the supernatural mountain to bring it                   into the human realm, and vice versa.</p>                <p class="maintext">The wall also sets up a visual boundary between                   viewer and rock. Perhaps the stone wall was used as a means                   of keeping people at a distance from a particularly powerful                   object or was a marker of the extremely sacred. Sacred places,                   beings or objects called huacas dotted the Inka landscape. These                   huacas took on many forms including springs, mountain peaks                   and rocks and facilitated communication with the supernatural                   world.[12] As such, they would have served as powerful mediators                   between the supernatural and natural, making it too dangerous                   for ordinary people to touch them. Frames around these powerful                   objects may have protected or reminded the viewer not to get                   too close. </p>                <table width="33%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="phillips_5.jpg" width="400" height="273"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Figure 5.

In this case, the finely cut walls of the D-shaped structure                   curve around the embedded boulder which has been subtly manipulated                   to mark an astronomical alignment. A window opening, located                   on the curved wall faces northeast and was oriented toward the                   Pleaides rise azimuth (65&deg;) during the fifteenth century.[13]                   Upon the rising of the sun at the June Solstice, the sun&#8217;s                   rays would have lined up with an edge cut into the stone.[14]                   In this structure, then, framing takes on multivalent functions.                   Not only would the entire structure have acted as a border for                   the rock outcrop, but the window located in the curved wall                   would have framed the astronomical phenomenon that occurred                   annually at this spot.</p>                <table width="33%" border="1" align="left" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="phillips_6.jpg" width="400" height="250"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Figure 6.

Susan Niles states that                   the &#8220;Inka repertory of forms includes viewing platforms,                   thrones and fenestrated walls oriented to frame prominent features                   of the landscape.&#8221;[15] Whereas Paternosto notes that windows                   facing east oftentimes &#8220;framed mountains that must have                   had a sacred character.&#8221;[16] One structure at Machu Picchu,                   &#8220;Temple of the Three Windows,&#8221; has three unusually                   large trapezoidal windows that face east (Figure 6). Not only                   do the openings direct one&#8217;s gaze to the Yanantin mountain                   to the east, but the presence of three windows may visually                   signal the recreation of an Inka origin myth. The Spanish chronicler,                   Sarmiento de Gamboa, relates that the birthplace of the first                   four Inkas was from three windows in the side of a hill, much                   like the structure at Machu Picchu.[17] The framing devices                   here, then, make an implicit connection between human observer,                   sacred landscape and Inka rulership.</p>                <p class="maintext">Just as with the &#8220;Sacred Rock,&#8221;                   the Intihuatana or &#8220;Hitching Post of the Sun,&#8221; appears                   to have been sculpturally manipulated to replicate the curvature                   of the mountain behind it (Figure 7). Located at the highest                   point of the main plaza area of Machu Picchu, it is visually                   framed by flanking structures. Although its function has not                   yet been determined, it may have served as a place to set offerings                   to the Sun or may have symbolized the &#8220;place spirit&#8221;                   of the mountain.[18] Whatever its function, it is clear from                   its high placement, mimicry of the surrounding mountains as                   well as the presence of framing devices that the Intihuatana                   was a very important monument.</p>                <p class="maintext">Another framing technique commonly employed                   by the Inka is serial doorwayor window alignment. While there                   are many examples of this type of alignment at Machu Picchu,                   Hu&aacute;nuco Pampa provides a particularly striking example.                   Hu&aacute;nuco Pampa is a well-preserved site located north                   of Machu Picchu on a flat plain high above the Urqumay River                   in Peru. The site covers an area of approximately 1.24 square                   miles and originally held approximately 4,000 structures.[19]                   Finely cut stone, associated with the elite, can only be seen                   in the eastern sector of buildings which is thought to have                   been a palace complex for the Inka ruler, Thupa Inka Yupanki.[20]                   It is in this elite sector that Inka artisans constructed a                   series of four trapezoidal, double-jambed doorways each aligned                   to frame the other as one looked from the main plaza toward                   the palace compound (Figure 2). These gateways would have traced                   a long east-west passageway connecting the main plaza to the                   ruler by framing him as he walked out of his palace toward the                   people gathered in the central plaza. The eastward direction                   traveled by the Inka as he arrived at the plaza, and the westward                   direction in which he returned, may have emphasized, together                   with the bordering elements, the ruler&#8217;s sacred and political                   power.</p>                <p class="maintext">The framing examples at Machu Picchu and Hu&aacute;nuco                   Pampa suggest that Inka artisans deliberately chose to frame                   certain objects through the strategic placement of stone or                   architectural elements. These examples point to functions that                   adhere to deeply ingrained Inka worldviews, namely reciprocity,                   politico-religious sanctity and the continuous dialogue between                   humans and the surrounding sacred landscape. </p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p><a href="phillips_notes.html" class="linkbody">Sources&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p class="second"><a href="phillips_bio.html" class="linkbody">Author's                   Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>                  &nbsp; </p></td>          <td width="10">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center">          <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../index.html">P<em>ART</em></a></font><a href="../index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            home </font></a></p>          </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>      <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;         2004 P<i>ART</i> and Ruth Anne Phillips.
