<p class="second">                   During the nineteenth century there was an increased international                   interest in the work of seventeenth-century Dutch landscapists.                   This sparked many Dutch artists to develop a new appreciation                   for their artistic heritage, particularly landscapes. This genre                   of painting was revitalized in the work of Hague School artists                   such as Anton Mauve and Jacob Maris. In works like Mauve's <a href="http://www.vertechinc.com/archive/country22/mauve.htm" class="linkbody"><em>Changing                   Pasture</em></a> (1880's) these artists celebrated Holland's                   rich, agrarian past. Both their seventeenth-century predecessors                   and the French Barbizon School influenced these artists. The                   Hague School used a muted color palette similar to earlier Dutch                   artists. The group used a naturalistic style similar to the                   Barbizon School, but gave their subjects a more sentimental                   feeling.[1]</p>                <p class="second"> It was against this backdrop of renewed artistic                   ferment that the young Vincent van Gogh found part of his inspiration                   to become an artist. Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the                   Hague School, particularly its artists&#8217; ability to capture                   nature on canvas. He commented, &#8220;A picture by Mauve, Maris,                   or Isra&euml;ls says more, and says it more clearly than nature                   herself.&#8221; [2]</p>                <p class="second"> This love of nature and peasant life also had                   its roots in his early childhood. His father, Theodorus van                   Gogh, had been a minister in the Groningen sect of the Dutch                   Reformed Church, whose members celebrated God's divine presence                   in the natural world.[3] Evidence of this is found in Van Gogh's                   own writings. Van Gogh reminisced about his childhood love of                   nature: &#8220;Has everybody been thoughtful as a child, has                   everyone who has seen them really loved the heath, fields, meadow,                   woods.&#8221;[4]</p>                <p class="second"> After several failed attempts at various careers,                   in 1883 Van Gogh returned home to the Netherlands in 1883, where                   he decided to become an artist. Here he depicted the Dutch countryside                   of Drenthe. He felt that the land had a timeless quality, which                   harkened back to a purer, simpler time before the rise of modern                   industrialization. He wrote, &#8220;If you come to the remote                   back county of Drenthe&#8230;you will feel as if you lived in                   the time of Van Goyen, Ruisdael&#8230;such natural surroundings&#8230;roused                   in the heart&#8230;something of that free, cheerful spirit of                   former times.&#8221;[5] He felt that his depictions of the countryside                   linked him to the great Dutch masters of the past. </p>                <p class="second"> During this period, Van Gogh continued his                   artistic exploration of the nobility of peasant labor and its                   connection with the sanctity of work and the land. This was                   accomplished through his depiction of the weavers in the village                   of Nuenen, as seen in his <a href="http://www.mystudios.com/art/post/van-gogh/van-gogh-weaver-1884.html" class="linkbody"><em>Weaver                   with a View of Nuenen Tower</em></a> (1884).</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh depicts the weaver actively working                   at his loom. Through the open window, we can see the countryside,                   with a woman picking crops and a church steeple in the distance.                   Here he depicts all the things that he values: the dignity of                   manual labor (as seen in the weaver working on the mechanical                   loom) and the importance of one who labors close to nature (represented                   by the woman toiling in the field). All this takes place in                   the presence of God, symbolized by the church steeple in the                   distance. The presence of the steeple also links the painting                   visually with the landscape works of his Dutch predecessors.                   The symbolism of this painting is similar, in certain respects,                   to images such as Jacob van Ruisdael's <a href="http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/r/ruysdael/jacob/2/view_haa.html" class="linkbody"><em>View                   of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds</em></a> (1665)[6].</p>                <p class="second"> It was also during this period that Van Gogh                   began to work with a perspective frame. The frame had strings                   that ran through its center. They were used to line up the landscape                   so the artist could paint it. Debora Silverman has pointed out                   that Van Gogh came to associate his frame with that of the weavers.                   He had been taught to think of painting as a craft by his secondary                   school teacher, Constantijn Huysmans. Silverman argues that                   Van Gogh thought of himself as a painter-artisan, weaving his                   paintings with his perspective frame.[7]</p>                <p class="second"> At the same time, Van Gogh was also developing                   his own color theories. He based them on the complementary color                   theories of Michel Chevreul, director of the Gobelins Tapestry                   Works.[8] Inspired by Chevreul's work in the weaving industry,                   Van Gogh kept a box of colored yarn, which he used as a complementary                   color palette. In addition, Van Gogh thickened his brush stroke                   in order to give his paintings the feeling of woven cloth.[9]<br>                  In 1886, Van Gogh moved to Paris. Here he experimented with                   new painting techniques, like Pointillism, which caused him                   to lighten his color palette. He began to use colors more arbitrarily                   in order to express emotion. This trend, which affected his                   later landscape paintings, would continue to develop throughout                   his career.[10]</p>                <p class="second"> In 1888, growing weary of the hectic city life                   in Paris, he moved to Arles, a small town in the South of France.                   It reminded him of his home in Holland. Van Gogh wrote that                   the landscape was &#8220;exactly like Holland in character.&#8221;[11]                   In Arles, he returned to two of his major subjects: the peasant                   and the landscape.</p>                <p class="second"> While in Arles, Van Gogh was joined by his                   friend Paul Gauguin. They worked together for two months, but                   tensions soon arose, resulting in Van Gogh's mental breakdown.[12]                   In May 1889, Van Gogh, realizing that he could no longer live                   on his own, and voluntarily checked himself into the asylum                   of St. Paul-de-Mausole in St. R&eacute;my de Provence. While                   at the hospital, Van Gogh continued to paint, at times in the                   surrounding countryside. He also painted the view from his hospital                   room. He was particularly fascinated by the stars of the early                   morning sky.

Its most                   prominent building is its church, which dominates the center                   of the hamlet with its tall, thin spire. The small community                   is nestled in what appears to be the Provencal countryside near                   the asylum. In the background are the rugged Alpilles Mountains.                   A twisted cypress tree dominates the foreground, to the left                   of the village. The presence of the native cypress and the distant                   Alpilles both help identify this landscape as the one near the                   asylum. However, the most striking feature of the image is its                   dramatically rendered, star-filled evening sky. It contains                   eleven stars, whose blazing auras illuminate the heavens. The                   brightest star is located near the horizon, just to the right                   of the cypress. In the upper right corner, we see a crescent                   moon whose aura also illuminates the image. The central portion                   of the sky is dominated by a swirling wave-like pattern. Lastly,                   we see another undulating pattern, in the lower portion of the                   sky, running just above the hills.</p>                <p class="second"> Most scholars have pointed out that the scene                   is imaginary. It has its roots in the Provencal landscape around                   St. R&eacute;my, in Van Gogh's Dutch homeland and perhaps even                   in literature, specifically, the work of George Eliot.[13] Van                   Gogh placed a Dutch church from his childhood memory in his                   St. R&eacute;my landscape. The landscape, minus the village,                   was visible from his <a href="http://www.vangoghgallery.com/photos/remy5.htm" class="linkbody">cell                   window</a>. Here we see Gauguin's influence on the artist. He                   had encouraged Van Gogh to paint from his imagination.[14]</p>                <p class="second">Because Van Gogh's cell was located on the second                   floor, he gave the painting a high vantage point. The presence                   of the Alpilles Mountains confirms an easterly view.[15] Scholars                   have deduced that the cypress was also visible from his room,                   based on an old <a href="http://www.vangoghgallery.com/photos/remy3.htm" class="linkbody">advertisement</a>                   for the asylum.[16] </p>                <p class="second"> The painting looks as though it was viewed                   through the artist's cell window. Deborah Silverman has pointed                   out that during his Nuenen period, Van Gogh would use a window                   as a substitute for his perspective frame.[17] This is confirmed                   by the artist. He wrote, in May 1889, &#8220; through the iron                   barred window, I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure,                   a perspective like a Van Goyen, above which I can see the sunrising.&#8221;[18]                   The view from Van Gogh's cell window may be seen here.</p>                <p class="second"> Silverman also felt that Van Gogh's use of                   the perspective frame had symbolic religious significance linked                   to one of his favorite books, John Bunyan's <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>                   (1678). In the book, Bunyan used the idea of a spyglass as a                   metaphoric tool for spiritual focus. Silverman believed Van                   Gogh thought of his perspective frame as a spyglass which he                   used to create his paintings.[19] This idea was confirmed by                   the artist when he wrote, &#8220;I think you can imagine how                   delightful it is to turn this spy-hole frame on the sea or on                   the snowy fields in winter.&#8221;[20] With this in mind, Van                   Gogh may have wished the viewer of Starry Night to see the landscape                   as he did, through his window, like a perspective-frame spyglass;                   focused on the church, the symbol of the heavenly city of Jerusalem.</p>                <p class="second"> The painting's high vantage point, panoramic                   view with its large expanse of sky, and distant church link                   it visually with artists of both The Hague School and the seventeenth                   century Dutch landscapists. Van Gogh similarly used dual perspective                   points, created by the cypress in the foreground and the church                   steeple in the distance.[21]</p>                <p class="second"> This use of perspectival distance might also                   have deep religious significance. The far-off church often represents                   the heavenly city of Jerusalem in seventeenth-century landscape                   painting.[22] It probably serves a similar function here. The                   church is Dutch in style with a pointed steeple. The actual                   church of St. Martin in St. R&eacute;my had a dome and was not                   visible from Van Gogh's cell.[23]</p>                <p class="second"> The depiction of a Dutch church and Dutch formal                   elements such as the foregrounded tree is also symbolic of Van                   Gogh's wish to return home during this stressful time in the                   asylum. On numerous occasions, Van Gogh wrote that he wished                   to &#8220;return north.&#8221;[24]</p>                <p class="second"> The cypress in the foreground may also serve                   a dual function, both compositional and symbolic.[25] The tree,                   like the church steeple, is used to guide our eyes upward to                   look at the stars. To Van Gogh, the cypress had a deeper spiritual                   meaning. In his letter, he referred to these trees as &#8220;funeral                   cypresses.&#8221;[26] Around the Mediterranean, cypresses were                   planted in cemeteries. Ancient peoples also considered them                   symbols of immortality because of their long life.[27] The blackish                   green color of these trees also holds a similar meaning.[28]                   Van Gogh's flame-like treatment of the tree branches gives one                   the sensation that it is on fire. Fire has often been associated                   with rebirth or immortality. As a phoenix was reborn from fire,                   and then ascended skyward, so too, the flame-like branches of                   the cypress rise heavenward in the painting, suggesting immortality.[29]</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh said that the trees reminded him of                   &#8220;line and proportion like that of an Egyptian obelisk.&#8221;[30]                   He knew of the obelisk&#8217;s association with the life-giving                   powers of the Egyptian Sun God, Ra. The obelisk represented                   the sun's rays and Van Gogh had referred to the Provencal sun                   as &#8220;the good god sun.&#8221;[31]</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh's choice of the cypress can also be                   understood as a way to celebrate the specificity of the Provencal                   landscape. The cypress, like the olive tree (another favorite                   subject during this period), was native to the region. Possibly,                   Van Gogh identified with these hearty trees, which could survive                   in the harsh terrain around the asylum. In the past, he had                   referred to himself as &#8220;course&#8221; and &#8220;rough&#8221;[32],                   both words that can be used to describe these trees.</p>                <p class="second"> However, the main focus of the work is the                   heavenly bodies that fill the night sky. Scholars have attempted                   to identify the stars. The star lowest to the horizon is Venus,                   the Morning Star.[33] This is corroborated by Van Gogh, who                   wrote, &#8220;This morning I saw the country from my window                   a long time before sunrise with nothing but the Morning Star.&#8221;[34]                   The same scholars have also debated over the identification                   of the other stars.[35]</p>                <p class="second"> Like the rest of the elements in the work,                   the stars had a spiritual meaning. Since he was a young boy,                   Van Gogh had a deep fascination with the night sky. Based on                   believes of the Groningen sect he learned as a child, he associated                   the celestial bodies with the divine presence of God in the                   world.[36] Even after he became disenchanted with organized                   religion, Van Gogh still felt the spiritual pull of the stars.                   He wrote in 1888, &quot;[when] I have the terrible need of I                   dare say religion&#8230;then I go outside at night and paint                   the stars.&#8221;[37]<br>                  Van Gogh's depiction of stars can be linked to several literary                   sources. The eleven stars in the sky may symbolize the Biblical                   story of Joseph. The story of Joseph is one of suffering and                   spiritual triumph. This would have fit in well with Van Gogh's                   mind set at the time, as he struggled with his mental disability                   hoping for eventual salvation.[38]</p>                <p class="second"> The painting may also be connected to the poet                   Walt Whitman's book <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1855). Excerpts                   from the book were available in French in 1888; including poems                   from a section entitled &#8220;From Noon to Starry Night.&#8221;[39]                   Whitman and Van Gogh had a similar ideological outlook. Both                   believed in the presence of the divine in nature and celebrated                   it in their work. Each man rejected organized religion. They                   also had similar tastes in literature and art. Both read Dickens                   and Michelet and loved the paintings of Millet. In an 1888 letter,                   Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for Whitman's work.[40]</p>                <p class="second"> In <em>Starry Night</em>, Van Gogh captured                   the essential character of Whitman's work. In his poetry, there                   are numerous references to stars with their connection to the                   spiritual and the eternal. For both men, stars symbolized immortality.[41]                   Like Van Gogh, Whitman had a particular fascination with Venus,                   the &#8220;Morning Star.&#8221;[42]</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh noted seeing the &#8220;Morning Star&#8221;                   from his cell window on several occasions. He wrote of his association                   between the soul&#8217;s survival among the stars after death.                   He put down these thoughts in a letter, wondering, &#8220;Perhaps                   death is not the hardest thing in a painter's life&#8230;But                   looking at the stars makes me dream. Why shouldn't the shining                   dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map                   of France? Just as we take a train&#8212;we take death to reach                   a star.&#8221;[43]</p>                <p class="second"> The connection between Van Gogh and Whitman                   goes beyond the stars and their symbolic meaning. In other poems,                   such as &#8220;Weave In, My Hardy Life,&#8221; Whitman used                   weaving imagery to celebrate the creative life force in the                   world and in humanity. This type of imagery would have had great                   appeal for Van Gogh. He often depicted scenes celebrating the                   nobility of manual labor.[44] He would have also been interested                   in the weaving imagery for he thought of his canvases as tapestries                   interwoven with color. Also appearing high up in the heavens                   is the moon, which is clearly visible among the stars. Its depiction                   as a crescent also comes from Van Gogh's imagination. The moon                   was actually in a gibbous phase when the painting was created.[45]                   Like the stars, it too is steeped in symbolism. Van Gogh repeatedly                   used the crescent moon in his work.[46] It was a personal symbol                   of consolation. As a young man, he drew a crescent moon on a                   page of his Psalm book. The verse next to it speaks of spiritual                   hope.[47]</p>                <p class="second"> The moon may also refer to a passage from the                   &#8220;Book of Revelations.&#8221; Meyer Schapiro saw the moon                   embracing the sun in the painting. He believed that the image                   may refer to a passage from &#8220;Revelations xii&#8221; which                   describes the appearance of &#8220;a woman clothed with the                   sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head she wore a                   crown of twelve stars&#8221;.[48] If Schapiro is correct, the                   painting is to be read as one with apocalyptic overtones, not                   spiritual exultation, or consolation, which is more likely the                   case.</p>                <p class="second"> To the left of the moon is a large wave-like                   pattern. There has been much speculation as to its true meaning.                   It could be identified as a spiral galaxy or a comet.[49] I,                   myself, would argue that the wave-like pattern might depict                   the strong Mistral winds that are native to the region. Van                   Gogh referred to them and the difficulty they created for him                   in his attempt to paint outside in the countryside.[50]</p>                <p class="second"> Just below the wave, we see a long horizontal                   strip, which runs parallel along the horizon, following the                   shape of the mountains. This may represent the pre-dawn glow                   of the sunrise, since we know that the painting is focused in                   an easterly direction in the hours just before sunrise.</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh used an extremely expressive brushstroke                   in order to create a strong sense of rhythm in the painting.                   Undulating wave-like and circular patterns appear throughout                   the work. The pattern starts in the foreground bushes as small                   ball-like shapes. It then begins to widen out into an undulating                   shape, to accentuate the flow of the mountains in the background.                   It is repeated again just above the mountains in the highlighted                   horizon. It continues upward through the background of the sky,                   blending into the central wave-like shape. This shape becomes                   particularly important to the design composition, for here is                   where the transition is made into the circular shapes repeated                   in the eleven stars and their auras as well as the moon and                   its outer glow. </p>                <p class="second"> The horizontal movement is also felt in the                   roofs of the town buildings. This time the brushstrokes are                   more linear, to accent the geometry of the buildings. Contrasting                   the horizontality of the landscape and sky, are the vertical                   waves of the cypress branches and the sharply delineated church                   steeple. Van Gogh chose to outline most of the elements in his                   landscape, including the cypress. This ultimately helps distinguish                   the earthbound elements from the sky.</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh's trend toward stylization in this                   work is based on his continued dialogue with Gauguin. He expressed                   his desire &#8220;to seek a style&#8221;. He wished to make                   it &#8220;more viral by deliberately drawing&#8221;.[51] He                   felt that this put him in a similar category with Gauguin because                   his linearity is reminiscent of his Synthetist technique. Van                   Gogh wrote that, through these new techniques, they wished to                   create a modern art that would give spiritual &#8220;consolation&#8221;                   without overt religious symbolism, thus creating an image, which                   captured the &#8220;purer nature of the countryside.&#8221;[52]                   However, Van Gogh's work is more expressive and filled with                   a dynamic energy than that of his compatriot. This affinity                   for quick, expressive brushwork also had its roots in his Dutch                   past. He had admired the spontaneous brushwork of Frans Hals.                   He wrote of his admiration for Hals, &#8220;I saw Frans Hals                   you know how enthusiastic I was about it&#8230;about painting                   in one stroke.&#8221;[53]</p>                <p class="second"> The thick application of the paint in distinctive,                   linear strokes reminds one of woven cloth. Perhaps, this was                   a conscious choice by the artist because he thought of his paintings                   as being woven on his perspective frame or loom. Van Gogh referred                   to the application of his brushwork as being &#8220;interwoven                   with feeling&#8221;.[54] The strokes on the mountains remind                   one of tilled soil. Van Gogh liked to think of himself as a                   laborer or craftsman. He described how he painted as &#8220;plowing                   on my canvas as they do on their fields.&#8221;[55]</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh's choice of the complementary color                   scheme served a similar function as the brushwork: expressing                   a feeling. Of the expressive potential of color, he wrote, &#8220;color                   suggests ardor, temperament, any kind of emotion.&#8221;[56]                   He believed that the dominant color scheme of cobalt blue and                   citron yellow had a direct connection to the divine. He described                   the feeling of the infinite that these colors gave him, in his                   description of his painting, <a class="linkbody" href="http://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/p_0462.htm%20"><em>The                   Poet Eug&egrave;ne Boch</em></a> (1888). The artist explained,                   &#8220;I exaggerate the hair&#8230;pale citron yellow&#8230;I                   paint infinity, a plain background of the richest blue&#8230;and                   by this simple combination, the bright head against the rich                   blue background, which gets a mysterious effect, like a star                   in the sky in the depths of azure.&#8221;[57]</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh's association of these colors with                   the divine had its roots in the work of Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix.                   Van Gogh greatly admired Delacroix's work as a colorist. He                   believed that, &#8220;By going the way of Delacroix&#8230;by                   color and a more spontaneous drawing&#8230;one could express                   the purer nature of the countryside.&#8221;[58] Delacroix had                   depicted the image of Christ in his painting, <a class="linkbody" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=11&viewMode=1&item=29%2E100%2E131"><em>Christ                   Asleep During the Tempest</em></a> (1853).</p>                <p class="second"> He used the complementary color combination                   of citron yellow and a Prussian blue to express Christ's divinity.                   He used the yellow for Christ's halo and the blue to depict                   his cloak, which covered his head. Seeing this painting reinforced                   this color scheme's association with the divine.[59]</p>                <p class="second"> This color scheme, combined with the expressive                   movement of the brushwork, gives the night sky a feeling of                   divine exultation. The circular strokes of citron yellow around                   the stars and moon give the illusion that these heavenly bodies                   vibrate with radiant energy. Van Gogh's expressive style placed                   him in the forefront of the Post-Impressionist movement.[60]</p>                <p class="second"> Van Gogh's love of nature was one of the central                   themes of his life. This resulted in his creation of a body                   of work dedicated, in part, to the art of landscape painting.                   He associated the landscape with the presence of God in the                   world. This came out of his exposure to the Groningen School                   of Protestant theology of his childhood. Through this belief                   system, he came to value the importance of manual labor and                   the divinity of nature. He incorporated these themes into his                   work. During his hospitalization in St. R&eacute;my, Van Gogh                   had time to reflect on his childhood in Holland and the values                   he held dear. This resulted in the creation of one of his most                   celebrated works, <em>Starry Night</em>, which embodied these                   principle beliefs. In this image, created partially from memory,                   we see a Dutch village under a star-filled sky, a veritable                   tapestry of stars, and a symbol of spiritual consolation. This                   tapestry of stars, created by this weaver of images, has inspired                   a similar sense of wonder in viewers for much of the twentieth                   century, and will continue to fascinate well into the new millennium.</p>                <p class="second"><a href="etling.html" class="linkbody"><br>                  </a>                 <p class="second"><a href="etling_notes.html" class="linkbody">Sources&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p class="second"><a href="etling_bio.html" class="linkbody">Author's                   Bio&gt;&gt;</a> <br>                  &nbsp; </p></td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>       <td height="325" valign=bottom>         <div align="center">          <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../index.html">P<em>ART</em></a></font><a href="../index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            home </font></a></p>          </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>      <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;         2004 P<i>ART</i> and Jacquelyn Etling.
