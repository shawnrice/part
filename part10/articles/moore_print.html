Viewing Horn&#8217;s                   photographs and reading her text, the audience can travel on                   a psychogeographic journey that provides both a critique of                   and a solution to the deathly consumerism of contemporary culture.</p>                <p class="second">This work actually has two forms: <em>Another                   Water (The River Thames, for Example)</em> is the title of an                   artist's book while <em>Still Water (The River Thames, for Example)</em>                   refers to a series of exhibition photographs. The latter are                   sometimes shown in their entirety, as at SITE Santa Fe in 2000-2001,                   or in a smaller format; for example, only four were displayed                   in 2002 in the MoMA QNS Tempo show. The exhibition differs somewhat                   from the book in scale and aesthetic effect. The photographs                   in the exhibit consist of large close-ups of moving water (roughly                   30 x 41 inches), and the images of water are speckled with footnotes                   which match numbers in the tiny black text running along the                   white &quot;footer&quot; just underneath the photograph [Fig.                   1].</p>                <p class="second">In the more intimately scaled paperback book,                   no footnotes appear on the surface of the water and each photograph                   is split by the central binding of the book. The paper is matte                   and unframed, and the photographs extend to the edges of the                   page except along the bottom. The footnotes begin on the cover                   and wrap around into the book itself, ending mid-sentence on                   the back cover, thus creating a book with no end. The pictorial                   form of the book is therefore consonant with its physical form;                   together they reinforce the visceral impression of the endlessly                   running river [Fig. 2].</p>                <table width="35%" border="1" align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="moore_2.jpg" width="395" height="288"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext"><div align="center">Fig. 2.

Printed on the right side of the page, the paragraphs                   of text face the white, blank left side, in stark contrast to                   the photographs, creating a full stop in the otherwise seamless                   page-flipping [Fig. 3].</p>                <p class="second"> These documents of suicides add a fictional                   note, since it is hard to believe even the British police or                   newspapers are eccentric enough to report such details as: &quot;lavender                   sweater with scalloped white edging, black polyester knit leggings.&quot;                   There is no citation anywhere in the publishing information                   acknowledging police reports or permission from newspapers,                   so it can probably be assumed that they are indeed falsified.                   This element was not present in the Tempo or SITE Santa Fe exhibitions,                   and changes the mood of the work.</p>                <p class="second"> In fact, the obituaries make clear the subtext                   of <em>Another Water</em>: the attraction of the Thames River                   for suicides. Footnote: #397 reads: </p>                <p class="second">(Drowning is a more common suicide here than                   in the States. In the States it's mostly shooting. Maybe it's                   because you can't get guns here. But maybe it is also the quality                   of the water. It must be, because foreigners come to drown themselves                   in it). </p>                <table width="48%" border="1" align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="moore_3.jpg" width="243" height="432"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext"><div align="center">Fig. 3.

(Their motives or the                   effects of their actions are not mentioned, and Horn does not                   speculate about them - although the work as a whole can be considered                   an indirect speculation on the reason for their deaths). The                   most ordinary, normal-seeming people are documented in Another                   Water, as well as people in more unusual circumstances. Most                   striking perhaps is how prepared many of the suicides are -                   one man strapped his bike to his chest, other people taped their                   possessions to their bodies in cellophane bags. One particularly                   upsetting footnote (#158) describes a woman who drove her Ford                   Fiesta into the river with her Irish Setter, the windows closed,                   the door locked and the dog's leash wrapped around her hand.                   Horn&#8217;s apparently morbid interest in this facet of the                   river reflects her underlying theme - the question of meaningful                   existence in contemporary society. </p>                <p class="second"> In the footnotes underneath the water, Horn                   refers to many American and British cultural and literary sources,                   including the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Wallace Stevens,                   the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, Raymond Carver, and Flannery                   O'Connor, the novels of James Joyce, William Faulkner, Joseph                   Conrad, and Charles Dickens. She usually quotes a line, such                   as &quot;#47 (Between grief and nothing, I will take grief.)&quot;                   which refers to &quot;#48 From the novel The Wild Palms by William                   Faulkner, 1939.&quot; The text mentions numerous popular songs                   having to do with the river and death (Neil Young, Hank Williams,                   and The Temptations, to name a few), and various filmic moments,                   such as when the protagonist Alex considers suicide in <em>A                   Clockwork Orange</em> by Stanley Kubrick. Horn also refers to                   philosopher Martin Heidegger's 1967 essay &quot;What is a thing?&quot;                   [2], a meditation on the nature of existence. Critic Meg O'Rourke                   has commented that Horn's art &quot;does not come out of a sculptural                   tradition so much as an intellectual history that philosophically                   embraces the world and its disciplines.&quot; [3] Horn's many                   references to other sources create a web of associations and                   meanings, cumulatively adding to the effect of her art by engaging                   with a vast cultural array of ideas.</p>                <p class="second"> The unconventional use of footnotes in Another                   Water also recalls the fiction of David Foster Wallace, whose                   best selling 1996 novel <em>Infinite Jest</em> centers around                   a father's suicide. The notes lend an air of scholarly reassurance,                   functioning at times in a short series related by a theme which                   ends after a number of notes, and at others in discrete thoughts,                   such as &quot;#4: Thinking about water is thinking about the                   future - or just a future&quot; or &quot;#93 It's hard to talk                   about water without talking about oneself.&quot; They refer                   to various historical and sociological aspects of the Thames,                   such as the &quot;jumpers,&quot; Dead Man's Ledge (a place where                   bodies washed up in the nineteenth century before it was blocked),                   the many bridges, the pollution, and the birds. </p>                <p class="second"> The importance of language and the appropriation                   of literary and other cultural sources has a history in Horn's                   work. After graduating from the Yale MFA program in 1978, the                   New York-based artist began her career making conceptual, machine-made                   metal sculptures, quickly moving to pieces using Emily Dickinson's                   poetry and quotes from Simone Weil. In the 1980's Horn exhibited                   drawings of sentences, made from cut and pasted fragments of                   letters, and in the 1990's she began to experiment with photography,                   creating a number of artist's books in the series <em>To Place:                   &Iacute;sland</em>. These works, which document geologic and                   social realities intrinsic only to Iceland, reveal Horn's interest                   in the specifics of geographic location, an aspect also present                   in The River Thames. Horn's Iceland series relies heavily on                   this &quot;site-dependency,&quot; exploring various aspects                   of that country&#8217;s geologic oddities, such as its thermal                   waters or its unusual land formations, as metaphors for a primal,                   individual experience of nature. </p>                <p class="second"> Horn has not moved away from geography nor                   geology in <em>Another Water</em>, but her photographs here                   disavow a specific sense of place, extending the idea of landscape                   into a psychogeographic terrain. She has cropped out any distinguishing                   features of the river, such as its banks and bridges, showing                   only close-ups of the water itself. The only reflection Horn                   ever captures in the river photographs are abstract patterns                   created by the rippled surface of the water. Usually, in walking                   along or looking at a river, as Horn invites us to imagine we                   are doing, one is aware of the surrounding environment; the                   weather, the shores, buildings, human and animal presence, the                   sound of the river. Horn mentions several of these elements                   - she compares the noise of the river to the sound of the trees                   in the park scene from the movie <em>Blow-Up</em> and she has                   several passages referring to the bridges (&quot;So many bridges...invitingly                   scaled - a virtual forest&quot; #645); but they remain external                   to the direct visual impact.</p>                <p class="second"> Despite the increasing use of photography in                   her work, Horn has said that she does not consider herself a                   photographer per se. Her photographs usually rely on the indexical                   nature of the photograph; the fact that this place or person                   once existed and therefore that the photograph is a referent                   of the real.[4] However, in <em>Another Water</em>, the coordinates                   of time and space are absent, leaving the viewer to contemplate                   a metaphor of universality. <br>                  Because of the timeless, placeless quality of the photographs,                   Horn's geographical location and temporal setting is created                   instead by the text. The only landmarks, literally on the exhibition                   photos and figuratively in the text, are the footnotes: &quot;#466                   These notes, rootless, flowing one into another, are tiny landmarks                   of relation.&quot; Although she could be talking about any river,                   any water (footnote #807 &quot;Are you wondering if I'm talking                   about the Ganges? Or the Yangtze? Or even the Congo?&quot;),                   she discounts her native, New York Hudson (#175 &quot;The Hudson                   is black, too, but it's not dark&quot;). The Thames in particular                   calls forth these speculations. This focus on the uniqueness                   of a particular geographic area is part of Horn's ongoing project                   to retrieve the specificity of place so easily lost in contemporary                   life. It points to a shift away from the idealism and romanticism                   Horn has evinced for Iceland to the more sordid reality of Anglo-American                   life. </p>                <p class="second">Although on the one hand Horn encourages us                   to imagine the sound of the river or the look of the bridges,                   she also asks us to view the photographs not as images of water                   but in their object-ness, as literal paper. Her text causes                   us to consider the notes not as a fictive narrative presented                   in its totality but as a possible site for interaction with                   the author: &quot;What about this note? Do you like it?&quot;                   asks footnote #287. &quot;I could have moved it to another page,                   but that might have changed its content.&quot; Horn requires                   the viewer to become aware of his or her actions and interactions                   with the work, while calling up associations of other works                   and other ideas.</p>                <p class="second"> <em>Another Water</em> takes Horn's use of                   photography and interest with text and literary and cultural                   references in a new direction from most of her previous work,                   which reviewers have called &quot;austere and cerebral,&quot;[5]                   or &quot;laconic and seemingly hermetic.&quot; [6] But in <em>Another                   Water</em>, ideas jump to life and the viewer is almost overwhelmed                   by the intimate, confiding presence expressed through the text.                   The work speaks to us, as viewers; it engages us with questions                   and directs us with its syntax and references. Both text and                   photographs consciously play with the conventions of traditional                   writing and photography. Sometimes they are synchronized, producing                   together the effect of staring at water and letting one's thoughts                   run and drift. On other pages, the photographs contradict the                   text, such as when Horn discusses all of the &quot;eensie, weensie&quot;                   bodies of babies that must be in the Thames, creating the fantastic                   vision of a primordial soup. In contrast, the water appears                   clean, clear and entirely innocent. Horn also addresses the                   complexities of photography and her use of it in the text. A                   series of footnotes runs as follows: </p>                <p class="second"> #124 This photograph is an image of a moment                   on the Thames. It is also a moment similar to other moments                   of moving water and especially moments of rapidly moving water                   that were hardly visible...You feel like you've seen it before..                   But you haven't, what you've actually seen is a slur: the form                   a river often takes in real time.<br>                  #125 When you photograph water you strip it of its form: of                   its restless, liquid reality.<br>                  #126 When you photograph water you give it an image that in                   essential ways bears no likeness to water.<br>                  #127 When you photograph water you speak in graphic terms about                   something that has no graphic aspect.</p>                <p class="second"> In these footnotes, Horn reminds the viewer                   to be aware of the representational capacity of photography                   by pointing out all of the aspects of a river that photography                   cannot represent: its temporal quality of constant change, its                   wetness and its motion. Through words, she reminds us of the                   quality of water's very &quot;being,&quot; which can only be                   imagined and not actualized, reproducible neither by words nor                   by images. </p>                <p class="second"> Critic Frances Richard has said of Horn's sculpture                   that it &quot;grapples with the maddening and/or ecstatic drift                   that plagues representational systems, the tenuous connection                   between extant objects and their names or pictures.&quot; [7]                   The use of three means of representation in Another Water -                   written description, photography, and what appear to be official                   documents - shows Horn&#8217;s continued interest in the processes                   of representation and their meanings. The intersections of these                   systems move towards a more comprehensive effect of meaning.                   The numbered footnotes create a de-centered, flowing chain of                   thoughts; a system, but one that changes, revealing slight inconsistencies.                   For example, footnote #832 exactly repeats #285 except that                   the word &quot;brownish&quot; is substituted for &quot;greenish.&quot;                   The whole text repeats itself several times but not in quite                   the same order, leaving the viewer to wonder, did I read this                   before? In relation to what? But this is a gentle disruption,                   only mildly disorienting. The photographs, which do not repeat                   (although they could and it would be difficult to tell) represent                   different moments in time on the river, revealed by their different                   colors, light and surface texture. </p>                <p class="second"> <em>Another Water</em> brings predecessors                   to mind, such as Vija Celmins' <em>Untitled (Ocean)</em> (1970),                   a highly skilled graphite drawing of waves covering an entire                   sheet of paper. Another Water also suggests Felix Gonzalez-Torres's                   &#8220;stack&#8221; <em>Untitled</em> (1991), a roughly three                   by four foot rectangular pile of paper with the same black and                   white photograph of water printed on every sheet, and Lani Maestro's                   1993 <em>a book thick of ocean</em>, which contains pages of                   photographs of water without edges or borders. Clearly there                   is something unique and mysterious about this image of endless                   water that lends itself to each work. Despite the similarity                   in imagery, however, these works are not repetitive. The different                   forms and media, and especially Horn&#8217;s inclusion of text,                   which the others lack, differentiates them. Horn&#8217;s friendship                   with Gonzalez-Torres - they made works for each other, such                   as Horn&#8217;s <em>Gold Mats, Paired For Ross and Felix</em>                   (1994-1995) and Gonzalez-Torres&#8217;s <em>Untitled (Placebo-Landscape                   for Roni)</em> (1993) - makes the connection with death and                   repetition between <em>Another Water</em> and Gonazalez-Torres's                   stack particularly pertinent. <em>Untitled</em> (1991) is black                   and white, however, endlessly repeating the same, rather sinister                   image of black water, while Horn&#8217;s color photographs differ                   from each other, and her use of color gives the photographs                   a life and vibrancy not present in Gonzalez-Torres&#8217;s work.                 </p>                <p class="second"> Yet another conceptually and visually similar                   work is Andreas Gursky's digitally manipulated photograph of                   the Rhine river, <em>Rhine II</em> (1999). But again, Horn&#8217;s                   inclusion of chatty text gives this piece a markedly different                   feel from the mute image of Gursky, and her visual contemplation                   of the Thames, a river as significant for Anglo culture as the                   Rhine is for German, is given a sense of passing time, motion                   and multiplicity by her variety of photographs, at the same                   time that her text evokes its more sinister qualities. <br>                  Horn remarks, </p>                <p class="second"> I am convinced the Thames itself is partly                   responsible for the suicides that end up there...The river evinces                   intimacy and fear. It possesses a monumentality without scale,                   and its surface is at once transparent and opaque. I took thousands                   of images of it, and I have come to see it as the ultimate metaphor,                   a mirror for our rights and wrongs, a surface in which we see                   ourselves. [8] </p>                <p class="second"> This mirror of rights and wrongs, in Horn's                   words, seems in fact only a mirror of wrongs - suicides, murders,                   pollution - unless one considers the stunning beauty of the                   photographs. Susan Sontag has said &quot;So successful has been                   the camera's role in beautifying the world that photographs,                   rather than the world, have become the standard of the beautiful.&quot;[9]                   Often photographs of ordinary or ugly places can display a composed                   beauty through the artifice of the photographer, and this collection                   of photographs, through being cropped of any landmarks and through                   close-up and careful attention to light, surface, and pattern,                   attends to this ability of the camera to create beauty where                   possibly none existed. Despite the sometimes strange, gelatinous                   textures and murky colors, the photographs seem to glow; it                   is clear that of the thousands of images Horn took, she used                   the most striking in this work. The landscape that Horn evokes                   in her text runs in an uneasy counterpoint to the striking visual                   beauty of her photographs. Hardly a landscape in the traditional                   sense, eschewing all visual representations of buildings, countryside,                   and people, Horn's text instead reminds us of the psychogeography                   of place, the panoramic combination of history, breaking news,                   trivia, cultural influences, and passing ephemera that accompany                   a personal and solitary experience of an actual landscape. That                   Horn hopes to portray such a psychogeography of contemporary                   culture can be seen in her peculiarly modern understanding of                   her subject. She acknowledges her postmodern style - the appropriation                   of other sources, usage of mixed media, and deconstructivist                   tendencies - in the wry footnote, &quot;We should recognize                   that contemporary water is mostly a parody of waters past;&quot;                   but this irony extends not only to her style but her view of                   death. All of Horn's references, other than her brief mention                   of Swift (not footnoted), are taken from literature, songs,                   films and philosophy of the mid-nineteenth to twentieth centuries.                   The earliest is a Poe short story dating from 1841. This seems                   less than coincidental if one considers possible works Horn                   does not cite - Hamlet, for instance, with Ophelia's drowning                   and Hamlet's constant, morbid preoccupation with ghosts, vengeance                   and death, seems at first an appropriate source to include in                   <em>Another Water</em>. But the noble tragedy of Shakespeare                   is antithetical to the modern, ironic attitude expressed by                   Horn. The suicides in <em>Another Water</em> are haunting precisely                   because their tragedy lies in the banality and everydayness                   of their lives and their existence in a consumer culture. They                   were ordinary men and women who subscribed to Hello, rode mountain                   bikes, and drove Ford Fiestas. </p>                <p class="second"> Such references in <em>Another Water</em> to                   brand names reveals Horn&#8217;s view of consumerism. She says:</p>                <p class="second"> My work is in part a critique of the ways,                   so pervasive in the television and entertainment industries,                   of placing the viewer in a passive relationship to the world.                   This cultivation of passivity is a by-product of the domestication                   of technology. It gives me the sense that America is dying of                   entertainment - dying of lack of contact or dialogue. [10] </p>                <p class="second">To combat this passive, banal death decreed                   by popular culture, Horn actively invokes a dialogue with the                   viewer by addressing the viewer through text - and also by introducing                   the topic of suicide, the presence of death as the choice of                   an individual. Horn&#8217;s documentation of these supposed                   suicides in intimate detail provides an indictment of popular                   culture and its unthinking fascination with goods that are supposed                   to provide happiness. <br>                  Yet Horn offers a solution at the same time, through her tracing                   of art, literature, and music that refer to death and the choice                   of being. In Horn&#8217;s engagement of the viewer, who is required                   to actively respond and to think, feel and question, and through                   the references to literature, film and music, Horn creates various                   webs of meaning and associations. The overall effect of Horn's                   writing is inclusive, ever-expanding, associative, and entertaining                   - the opposite of an alienation assumed to be felt by someone                   considering suicide. Her text invites surprise and the pleasure                   of following her inventive thoughts. Although some of the narrator's                   ideas are grisly or strange, the tone varies between poetic                   and jaunty, as in footnote #434:</p>                <p class="second"> I console myself with the horror of it...I                   try to visualize the viruses and bacteria as well, like hepatitis                   and e coli and the little bacteria of dysentery and cholera                   and that disease called Weils and, who knows, maybe a remnant                   of the plague, just lingering the way things tend to do near                   water. </p>                <p class="second">The pleasure of gaining new information, of                   connecting literary works, or of following a surprising train                   of thought or experiencing an amusing insight, together with                   the sinister beauty of the photographs, subverts the morbidity                   of the work.</p>                <p class="second"> The underlying point of Horn's correlation                   of the suicides of the Thames with her ontological interest                   represented by the river as a metaphor is revealed in the Heidegger                   essay that Horn cites. For Heidegger, a person is defined only                   by his or her death, because only at death is a person&#8217;s                   life essentially completed. Horn focuses specifically on suicides                   because they throw the question of being into high relief. In                   their choice to die, suicides make especially vivid the philosophical                   correspondence between being and death. And it is precisely                   the question of being, of contemporary existence in its meaning,                   its illnesses, its pollution, its proximity to death, and yet                   its ability for pleasure despite this, through literature and                   culture, which Horn examines. </p>                <table width="48%" border="1" align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000">                  <tr>                     <td><img src="moore_4.jpg" width="244" height="360"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext"><div align="center">Fig. 4.
