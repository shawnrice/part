class="second">                   My warmest thanks go to all the editors of PART who have been                   there every step of the way. Without their diligent editing                   and their unfailing support, these essays and reviews could                   not have been posted and could not contribute to the on-going                   debate of the role played by landscape in shaping art history.                   Thanks to Caterina Pierre who first approached me with the idea                   of editing an issue of PART devoted only to landscape and landscape                   painting, and to Allison Moore, Kate Bussard, and Dan Quiles                   for making it happen. Finally, thanks to the contributors of                   the articles, reviews, and practice, my deepest gratitude for                   having challenged me to revisit the topic which, if we lived                   in a perfect world, would remain the focus of my career.</p>                <p class="second"> I came to landscape painting, and especially                   French landscape painting of the 19th century, from a traditional                   modernist training. The story went this way: sometime in the                   middle of the 19th nineteenth-century, in France, artists explored                   a genre of painting that had been deemed minor by the official                   Academy. They did this in order to free themselves from the                   constraints of narrative story-telling in order to base their                   work on what they saw, experienced, and felt. In the generations                   following Th&eacute;odore Rousseau, Claude Monet, Paul Gauguin                   and Paul C&eacute;zanne, it was easy to travel to arrive at                   the abstraction of Wassily Kandinsky. This was one side of the                   story, but when I revisited the possibility of looking at landscape                   painting again as a topic for my dissertation, I found I wanted                   to include many other scenarios. They included looking beyond                   that neat Darwinist schema of evolution to consider such issues                   as the role played by landscape painting in the formation of                   national identity and the political and cultural implication                   of the triumph of landscape painting as the modernist genre                   par excellence.</p>                <p class="second"> It has now become a standard interpretation                   to link the rise of landscape painting with the rise of the                   bourgeoisie and the subsequent development of a metropolitan                   culture, to see the Argenteuil landscapes of Monet, the Proven&ccedil;al                   vistas of C&eacute;zanne, and Homer&#8217;s painting of Prout&#8217;s                   Neck as a reaction to a certain type of urban modernity. This                   connection between landscape painting, nature, and escape is                   easier for urban dwellers of the twenty-first century such as                   us to understand and empathize with, and this may be one of                   the reasons which make the papers in this issue strike the right                   chord and seem so relevant. There is perhaps no greater testament                   to this relevance than the central importance of the theme of                   landscape in contemporary art.</p>                <p class="second"> As the proposals came in throughout last spring                   and last summer, it became evident that my more traditional                   understanding of landscape--grounded in French painting of the                   late 1800s--was to be put to a serious test. I actually welcomed                   the challenge as I realized that the same issues were still                   at stake: the connection between landscape painting and spirituality                   in times when traditional religion seems often seemed bankrupted;                   the connection between a place and a construction of one&#8217;s                   cultural and national identity; the link between landscape,                   nature, and decoration; and, finally, the importance of confirming                   the existence of an imaginary landscape that exists beyond the                   local. I had already encountered all these issues while working                   on nineteenth century landscapes, but I had not realized they                   were all at work in the art of modern and contemporary artists                   as well as those of non-western cultures. And while a majority                   of contemporary art historical writing has made the body its                   main concern, the essays that comprise this issue of PART speak                   to the centrality of place and nature to global artistic production.</p>                <p class="second"> I had envisioned this editorial as being similar                   to the series of &#8220;State of Research in &#8230;&#8221;                   articles published in The Art Bulletin. But the contributions                   that I selected revealed another option to me, that of thinking                   about landscape as the beginning of a journey to distance places.                 </p>                <p class="second">When considering the transition from the worldview                   reepresented by my article on Rousseau and ecology and Jacqueline                   Etling&#8217;s investigation of the spiritual power of place                   for Vincent van Gogh to Jonathan Clancy&#8217;s consideration                   of Tiffanny&#8217;s mosaic The Dream Garden, it seems that we                   have witnessed the end of one era and the beginning of another.                   In Tiffany's Dream Garden, made at a time when Europe&#8217;s                   landscape was being ravaged by war, corporate capitalism chose                   to grace their workers and clients with an idyllic, but artificial,                   view of a shimmering nature, thereby bringing artifice to its                   ultimate conclusion. John Kaufman&#8217;s essay on Maya Deren&#8217;s                   film At Land sets the tone for the second part of this issue.                   Here, we move into an imaginary landscape created by the mind                   where, thanks to film's specificity, landscape becomes capable                   of embodying many symbolic narratives simultaneously. The journey                   continues with Allison Moore&#8217;s reading of Roni Horn&#8217;s                   Another Water, which links Horn&#8217;s work to the Situationist                   International and the experience of place. Our journey ends                   across the ocean from Europe, in South America, where Ruth Anne                   Philips considers the subtle ways in which the Incas framed                   their landscape via architecture, creating sacred space within                   the natural landscape. Considering this work brings us full                   circle and reminds us of the achievement of the work of twentieth-century                   land artists such as James Turrell and Richard Long. </p>                <p class="maintext">The books chosen by the reviewers are equality                   telling and challenging. They shed new light on more traditional                   aspects of landscape paintings, from the painting of the Hudson                   River School to the landscapes of Pre-Raphaelites to Earth Art.                   These three reviews present a sampling of what recent scholarship                   on the topic as to offer. The last two reviews consider books                   that deal with gender and landscape, their contribution to the                   field is probably one of the most useful for anyone interested                   in the subject, but also for any scholar interested in the historical                   role of gender and representation.</p>                <p class="second"> Finally, as the reader discovers Joshua Shamsi&#8217;s                   Urban Idylls photographs, it becomes obvious that, although                   landscape painting has traditionally offered an escape mechanism                   for its urban audience, contemporary artists can now create                   art from those urban spaces which exist exclusively to allow                   us to escape from urbanity itself. <br>                  <br>                </p>                <p> </p>                <p class="second"><a href="articles/chagnonburke_bio.html" class="linkbody">Author's                   Bio&gt;&gt;</a></p>                <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>                </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center">          <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="index.html">P<em>ART</em></a></font><a href="index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            home </font></a></p>          </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>      <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;         2004 P<i>ART</i> and V&eacute;ronique Chagnon-Burke.
