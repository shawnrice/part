Not an exhibition catalogue in the traditional sense,                   Udall&#8217;s book is meant to accompany and compliment the                   exhibition while standing on its own as a trade publication.                 </p>                <p class="second"> Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) and Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe                   (1887-1986) are undeniably the most famous female artists of                   the 20th century and have for decades inspired veritable cottage                   industries of art historical and feminist scholarship. The artists                   have proven equally irresistible commercially. In May 2001 Christie&#8217;s                   New York sold O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s <em>Calla Lillies with                   Red Anenome</em> (1928, oil on masonite, Private Collection)                   for just over $6 million, setting the world auction record for                   a work by any woman artist. Prices for Kahlo&#8217;s paintings                   do not lag far behind, and it is well known that pop icon Madonna                   is an avid collector. The market for Kahlo and O&#8217;Keeffe                   and their works also extends to the more general public. Their                   images proliferate as posters that adorn innumerable college                   dorm room walls, and coffee mugs and calendars that inhabit                   countless homes and offices. The shop at the O&#8217;Keeffe                   Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico offers a product line ranging                   from jewelry and clothing to videos and compact discs, all inspired                   by the artist&#8217;s life and work. Miramax&#8217;s 2002 biographical                   film <em>Frida</em> is the largest commercial venture to date,                   capitalizing on the enormous dramatic potential of the artist&#8217;s                   well-known life story.</p>                <p class="second"> Emily Carr (1871-1945) has likewise been the                   subject attention lately, though on a much smaller scale than                   her counterparts. Udall&#8217;s book is one of two recently                   published on Carr. That the second, Susan Crean&#8217;s 2001                   <em>The Laughing One: A Journey to Emily Carr</em>, is a personal                   take on and tribute to the artist indicates that Carr&#8217;s                   own biography may have the dramatic potential it takes to endear                   her to both scholars and non-scholars alike, and thus propel                   to her cult figure status. Canadian landscape painting of the                   first half of the 20th century has become increasingly popular                   in recent years. Numerous exhibitions and publications have                   been dedicated to the subject, and prices for the works have                   been soaring.</p>                <p class="second"> In bringing Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo                   together, Udall sets out to highlight both the similarities                   and differences in their approaches to creating art and creating                   their own lives. Taking a broad approach to The Americas, Udall                   demonstrates how each of these three female artists &#8211;                   in Canada, the United States, and Mexico &#8211; rooted herself                   in her native landscape and then reinvented the image of that                   place in her work. Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo were each                   expressing a keen sense of national identity, which Udall conceives                   of as &#8220;a space which is simultaneously physical, linguistic,                   symbolic, cultural, and social.&#8221; (9) But because the three                   were artists in an increasingly &#8220;transnational period,&#8221;                   their aesthetic and geographic boundaries were fluid and permeable.                   This process of reinventing the landscape, Udall argues, holds                   the key to aspects of each artist&#8217;s developing social                   and personal identities. </p>                <p class="second"> Udall&#8217;s methodological approach negotiates                   a place between essentialist and social constructivist theories.                   She argues &#8220;that women&#8217;s identity is complex and                   nuanced, a product of both history and social construction&#8221;                   (vii) and draws upon feminist, and postcolonial theory, as well                   as on ethnohistorical material. Rather than approaching her                   subjects via biography (as Kahlo and O&#8217;Keeffe scholars                   almost always do), Udall begins with the works themselves. Careful                   analysis of the themes, structures, and forms of their art bears                   out her point that their works and creative processes were inextricably                   linked to tied to their sense of place and developing sense                   of self. Their work shares an attachment to place and nationality,                   an intense connection to nature and to indigenous cultures,                   and a resistance to European influence that unites Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe,                   and Kahlo in their conception of the landscape.</p>                <p class="second"> The book is organized in three parts, within                   which are smaller chapters. In Part One, &#8220;Landscape and                   Identity,&#8221; Udall explores the artists&#8217; special connectedness                   to place, which she sees as the key to understanding their art.                   Chapter I, &#8220;Nationality, Religion, and the Cultural Landscape,&#8221;                   considers the landscape, both real and as imagined by Carr,                   O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo, as it relates to a sense of national                   identity. All three artists took pains to understand and establish                   a strong sense of cultural nationalism in their lives and in                   their work. For Kahlo, it was through Mexicanidad &#8211; she                   identified closely with the Mexican past and Mexican earth.                   Carr&#8217;s nationalism was grounded in the balance between                   European and Canadian culture &#8211; her psyche was deeply                   connected to Canada&#8217;s history, geography, and people.                   In considering O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s sense of her own nationality,                   we are struck form the outset by the self-conscious way she                   set out to be an American painter. She capitalized on her Americanness                   and her connectedness to the unique aspects of the American                   landscape. <br>                  In Chapter II, &#8220;The Natural Self: The Body and Nature,&#8221;                   Udall explores the ways in which each artist visualized a psychic                   and physical connection between their bodies and the earth.                   She argues that images of the landscape are almost always self-referential.                   This is perhaps most apparent in Kahlo&#8217;s self-portraits                   where her she is literally seated in the lap of Mother Earth                   or else physically connected to the earth by hair, which frequently                   takes the form of root-like tendrils that burrow into the landscape.                   Instead of depicting their bodies in the landscape O&#8217;Keeffe                   and Carr connected themselves with nature by cloaking experience                   in natural forms. For O&#8217;Keeffe, trees provide a means                   of understanding how the artist&#8217;s sensibilities developed.                   Trees are the central subject of Carr&#8217;s work, and Udall                   demonstrates that they were the botanical counterpart of her                   own imagined existence in nature. Udall highlights the similarities                   and differences in the ways in which the three artists explore                   their connectedness to aspects of the landscape.</p>                <p class="second"> &#8220;To state it succinctly, identity is                   complex: multiple, fluid, and subject to interpretation.&#8221;                   (201) Udall examines the themes of self-discovery and the creation                   of a personal mythology in Chapter III, &#8220;Portrait of the                   Artist as a Young Woman.&#8221; The biographies of Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe,                   and Kahlo are similar several important ways: all were born                   into comfortably wealthy homes; all became connected to powerful                   male artists; and all remained childless. It is in the differences,                   however, that Udall claims we can best understand the choices                   and sacrifices that each artist made in order to succeed as                   an artist. For each artist, the creation of her identity, like                   the creation of her art, was ongoing. In this chapter, Udall                   documents the early lives of the artists and shows how their                   childhood experiences and their families exerted a profound                   influence on their adult lives as artists.</p>                <p class="second"> The theme of Chapter IV, &#8220;Private Spaces:                   The Artist in a Place of Her Own,&#8221; is that the places                   Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo chose to live and work were                   important to their self-mythologizing. &#8220;Each labored,                   over many years, to create highly idiosyncratic living and working                   spaces, places that in time became repositories of their energies.&#8221;                   (217) Udall uses photographs of the spaces and the artists&#8217;                   own writings to convey the central role that Carr&#8217;s studio                   in Victoria, British Columbia, O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s in Abiquiu,                   and Kahlo&#8217;s at her parents&#8217; home in Coyoac&aacute;n,                   had on their creation of themselves and their work.</p>                <p class="second"> In Chapter V, &#8220;The Spiritual Core,&#8221;                   Udall argues that Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo, however differently                   they constructed their own realities, all probed for meaning                   within the spiritual aspects of consciousness. &#8220;They formed                   their individual mythologies, which were deeply entwined with                   their conceptions of the spiritual, by contemplation of the                   universe at large as well as some of its smallest parts.&#8221;(235)                   She finds evidence of their quests in their paintings and in                   their words which, for Udall, adds a dimension of complexity                   and depth to their work. <br>                  Udall considers the ways Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo subverted                   the world of strong gender dichotomies into which they were                   born in the sixth chapter, &#8220;Sexuality, Androgyny, and                   Personal Appearance.&#8221; Dress helped each artist project                   a distinctive personal persona. Kahlo adopted the distinctive                   colorful dresses of Mexico&#8217;s Tehuana women, while O&#8217;Keeffe                   preferred clothing traditionally worn by men. &#8220;By appearing                   and painting in a manner that resembled no other, each achieved                   the singularity she sought all her life.&#8221;(276) Carr, on                   the other hand, never tried to look like a member of the artistic                   avant-garde, doing &#8220;nothing to suggest that she as other                   than a middle-aged, plump Anglo-Canadian woman.&#8221;(276)                   Despite the differences, Udall concludes that in their attitudes                   about personal appearance, gender, and sexuality, the artists                   revealed unique aspects of their creative selves.<br>                  Carr, O&#8217;Keeffe, and Kahlo each carefully crafted a narrative                   of how they had become the people and artists they were. That                   is the theme of Udall&#8217;s seventh and final chapter, &#8220;The                   Public Self: Careers, Contacts, and Reputations,&#8221; where                   she examines the ways the artists negotiated between their private                   and public selves, and what aspects of themselves they chose                   to reveal and what to protect. O&#8217;Keeffe and Carr shared                   an antipathy to outsiders prying into their personal lives,                   but also thrived on their roles as public artists. Kahlo, despite                   her growing fame in the 1930s, clung to what Udall calls &#8220;a                   kind of ironic primitivist public identity&#8221;(292) that                   was contrived despite the realities of her personal history.                   This desire to both be known and not known is shared by all                   three artists.</p>                <p class="second"> The final section of the book is a tripartite                   chronology where the histories of the artists unfold parallel                   to one another. This linking of their biographies through the                   chronology could lead one to falsely assume that the three artists                   were in constant contact throughout their lives. On the contrary,                   Udall points out early in the book that Kahlo and O&#8217;Keeffe                   met only a handful of times, and each time briefly. Carr met                   O&#8217;Keeffe only once quickly during a visit to New York                   in 1930. Carr and O&#8217;Keeffe never met. This begs the question,                   &#8220;So why devote an entire book comparing and contrasting                   the works of three artists who barely even knew one other? What                   is the point of drawing these connections?&#8221; Udall does                   an excellent job of using primary source materials &#8211; the                   artists&#8217; paintings and writings &#8211; to demonstrate                   the similarities in their approaches to the landscape, to themselves,                   and to art making in general were similar. What she fails to                   do in any convincing way is to make the reader understand why                   demonstrating these similarities and differences is an important                   or particularly enlightening exercise. </p>                <p class="second"> In addition to the tripartite chronology the                   book includes an index, but no bibliography. The design of the                   book is not ideal; taller than it is wide, the pages have too                   small of an upper margin and too wide of a lower one. However                   the book is generously illustrated with 60 in color and 101                   in black and white. Certain of the chapters seem to short and                   irrelevant to have warranted separate headings. The first two                   chapters on nationality and landscape were both strong and hearty,                   rendering the shorter chapters in Parts Two and Three less consequential                   in comparison.</p>                </td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr> </tr>    <tr> </tr>  </tbody></table></body></html>
