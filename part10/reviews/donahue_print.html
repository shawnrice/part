Second                   Edition. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001.</strong></p>                <p class="second"> The first time I saw slides of English Victorian                   painting in a graduate art history class, I knew that I wanted                   to study Pre-Raphaelite art. The bright colors and meticulous                   details differed profoundly from what I had seen of the 19th                   century as an undergraduate and were to my eyes beautiful. Since                   then I have come to see emblems of &#8220;truth to nature&#8221;                   in these English paintings, while retaining a sense of the beauty                   offered up in carefully rendered greenery. There is reason to                   say that today nature-related and Pre-Raphaelite painting is                   experiencing avid scholarly interest. The attention to landscape                   found in PART and a &#8220;new&#8221; book about Pre-Raphaelitism                   suggests this. Elsewhere V&eacute;ronique Chagnon-Burke and                   I implicated nature in the 1990s revival of beauty in art and                   design [1]. We noticed that beauty took the form of nature most                   often in terms of the physical environment, but also the human                   figure. During its day beauty was frequently identified with                   the female figure in Pre-Raphaelite painting. Could the recent                   tendency in beauty offer insight into their engagement with                   the natural world?</p>                <p class="second"> Allen Staley&#8217;s lavishly illustrated book                   is a fitting testament to both topics. First published in 1973                   by Oxford University Press, the book grew out of Staley&#8217;s                   dissertation at Yale during the 1960s, itself a time of renewed                   interest in things Pre-Raphaelite (hereafter PR). The author                   intended to illuminate the largely unknown area of landscape                   painting undertaken by the PR Brotherhood and followers during                   the 1850s and 1860s together with their stance toward &#8220;the                   natural world&#8221;. As a group the Brotherhood spanned the                   years from 1848 to roughly 1853, centering around the painters,                   William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel                   Rossetti. It also included the painters, James Collinson and                   Frederick George Stevens; Thomas Woolner, sculptor; and art                   critic, William Michael Rossetti. Of these Hunt and Millais                   are linked with outdoor painting.</p>                <p class="second"> Staley&#8217;s study helped change the thinking                   about John Ruskin&#8217;s role in the origins of PR naturalism,                   setting the pace for what is now synonymous with the history                   of Pre-Raphaelitism in general. Early histories underplay Ruskin&#8217;s                   influence; one reason being that the painters incorporated a                   new realism prior to their 1851 meeting with the renown critic.                   Staley emphasizes the significance of Ruskin&#8217;s ideas through                   his writings, which began well before his advocacy and patronage.                   Ruskin&#8217;s most germane work, Volumes I (1843) and II (1846)                   of <em>Modern Painters</em>, advocated the direct study of the                   motif and close attention to finish and natural details. </p>                <p class="second"> Besides rejecting inherited techniques and                   styles in favor of close observation and description, Ruskin&#8217;s                   approach differed from previous English theorists, because it                   insisted upon specific versus general detail. The precise delineation                   of a tree branch or leaf, for example, especially in the immediate                   foreground, violated the conventions that taught artists to                   blur these objects or leave them in shade. While citing Hunt&#8217;s                   own words of enthusiasm for the second volume of <em>Modern                   Painters</em>, whose focus is early Italian painting, the first                   volume according to Staley was the most influential. This book                   strove through the example of Turner to elevate landscape painting&#8217;s                   status, ending with the now famous advice to young artists:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="second"> &#8230;[They should] go to nature in all                     singleness of heart, and walk with her laboriously and trustingly,                     having no other thoughts but how best to penetrate her meaning,                     and remembering her instruction; rejecting nothing, selecting                     nothing and scorning nothing&#8230;[2].</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second">The second edition resembles Staley&#8217;s                   first book in the above. It also assumes the same historical                   posture drawing on contemporary exhibition catalogs, art criticism                   and other written accounts in an effort to discuss artists,                   their ideas and works, in relation to Ruskin when possible.                   In this way Staley maps out a trajectory of PR landscape painting,                   locating it in the context of nineteenth-century developments                   in landscape in England and France. After chapters about the                   background of the PR Movement and Ruskin&#8217;s ideas, the                   book is organized largely around individual artists, beginning                   with the example of Ford Maddox Brown as an influential associate                   of the Brotherhood, followed by core members of the group, Hunt                   and Millais. In light of recent scholarship chapters are devoted                   to related artists: Thomas Seddon, George Price Boyce, John                   William Inchbold , John Brett and William Dyce. </p>                <p class="second"> Methodologically speaking the information and                   pictures are so rich they tend to obscure the lack of new interpretational                   strategies. The only homage to the new art history admittedly                   treats the work of women artists in a chapter entitled &#8220;Some                   Friends and Followers&#8221;, among them, Anna Blunden, Rosa                   Brett and Barbara Bodichon. With the ground set by Staley and                   subsequent scholars, an interdisciplinary approach would be                   informative. Through a study of artists and styles, Staley examined                   PR landscape and related painting during the 1850s and 1860s                   in conjunction with attitudes toward nature. </p>                <p class="second"> But the Pre-Raphaelites and associates were                   more than painters and describers of landscape. They embraced                   the area of design, writing and nature as a whole. Christina                   Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris and Algernon                   Charles Swinburne immediately come to mind. From painting to                   wall paper to furnishings to poetry their work teams with references                   to flowers, plants, water, gardens, and the seasons. Even when                   Hunt and Millais painted outdoor scenes, they seemed more inclined                   to depict abundant natural imagery than landscapes per se. For                   this reason developments in garden planning, interior design,                   poetry, literature, fashion, and the culture of flowers become                   worthy of note. Scholars of English literature have long observed                   a similarity between Victorian poetry and PR painting and verse                   through the &#8220;aesthetics of the particular&#8221; [3].                   I would add nature&#8217;s particulars to the equation. The                   poet Gerard Manley Hopkins is representative:</p>                <blockquote>                  <p class="second"> Glory be to God for dappled things &#8211;<br>                    For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;<br>                    For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;<br>                    Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches&#8217; wings;<br>                    Landscape plotted and pieces &#8211; fold, fallow, and plough;<br>                    And all trades, their gear and tackle and trim&#8230; [4]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second"> Against the grain, this book contributes to                   the understanding of landscape painting as an expression of                   modern art, specifically &#8220;progressive&#8221; English painting,                   to borrow Staley&#8217;s words [5]. For Staley these landscape                   paintings and PR art in the main relate to Post Impressionist                   compositions through the &#8220;richly articulated two-dimensional                   patterns which stay on the surface of the canvas&#8221; [6].                   By taking cues from nature instead of art, he regards the work                   as extremely modern, with which I agree. But the lack of respect                   for tradition had a downside. Too stylistically radical to catch                   hold, the paintings failed to establish a new school of English                   art . Nonetheless the subject of landscape in tandem with English                   painting and PR art, largely outside the discourse of modern                   art history, receives a welcome nudge in Staley&#8217;s book.</p></td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr> </tr>    <tr> </tr>  </tbody></table></body></html>
