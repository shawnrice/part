Edited by Steven Adams                   and Anna Gruetzner Robins. Issues in Art History Series. New                   Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2001.</strong></p>                <p class="second"> Eight of the twelve essays in <em>Gendering                   Landscape Art</em> were delivered as conference papers at the                   Association of Art Historians Conference at the Courtauld Institute                   in 1997. The aim of this conference was to examine connections                   between gender and landscape art, a neglected area despite the                   recent interest in landscape and social, political and cultural                   history (i.e., Michael Rosenthal, Anne Bermingham, Nicholas                   Green, and W.J.T. Mitchell among others). Editors Steven Adams                   and Anna Gruetzner Robins provide a useful outline of the contribution                   of literature on landscape in their introduction, in which they                   define &#8220;gender&#8221; and &#8220;Nature&#8221; and give                   a broad definition of &#8220;landscape,&#8221; in part to accommodate                   the variety of viewpoints in the essays. The essays in this                   anthology are loosely structured around the intersection of                   gender, landscape and the following themes: technique and practice,                   national identity, psychoanalysis, and geographic space. The                   essays range from late eighteenth to late twentieth century                   art from England, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Russia,                   and the United States. </p>                <p class="second"> In the first essay, &#8220;Signs of Recovery:                   Landscape Painting and Masculinity in Nineteenth-Century France,&#8221;                   Adams examines the literature of landscape in late nineteenth-century                   France, referring not only to art critics, such as Charles Blanc,                   who spoke of line as &#8220;masculine&#8221; and color as &#8220;feminine,&#8221;                   but also to other writers: Hippolyte Taine, Emile Bellier and                   Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Henriet. Each of them asserted the popular                   contemporary notion of the virile but celibate child-like (male)                   landscape painter. Thus, landscape painters were &#8220;de-masculinized&#8221;                   by being celibate but then &#8220;re-masculinized&#8221; by                   the assertion of the creative genius of the painter. Surprisingly,                   Adams did not mention &Eacute;mile Zola&#8217;s novel <em>L&#8217;Oeuvre</em>                   (1886), in which the protagonist, Claude Lantier, was cast as                   a child-like genius painter who nearly stopped &#8220;creating&#8221;                   art when he indulged in his love for his model, then wife, Christine.                   Later he committed suicide after ending a lengthy period of                   celibacy, unable to complete his masterpiece. On the contrary,                   Paul Smith, in his essay &#8220;C&eacute;zanne&#8217;s Maternal                   Landscape and Its Gender,&#8221; begins his argument in part                   with a quote from <em>L&#8217;Oeuvre</em> in which the fictional                   Sandoz (Smith refers to Sandoz as &Eacute;mile Zola) reminisced                   about how he and Claude Lantier (C&eacute;zanne) enjoyed &#8220;une                   absorption instinctive au sein de la bonne nature&#8221; which                   he translated as &#8220;an instinctual absorption in the bosom                   of mother nature&#8221; (116). The key words in this sentence                   are &#8220;bosom&#8221; and &#8220;mother.&#8221; Smith uses                   this passage to claim that C&eacute;zanne viewed the landscape                   as &#8220;maternal.&#8221; This reliance on a passage from literature,                   no matter how close to &#8220;real life&#8221; it may have been,                   weakens Smith&#8217;s argument from the start. Smith proceeds                   to examine Cezanne&#8217;s mountainous landscapes psychoanalytically                   using lots of vague, unconvincing language, while admitting                   that his approach was conjectural. </p>                <p class="second">More solid and convincing is Anthea Callen&#8217;s                   essay, &#8220;Technique and Gender: Landscape, Ideology and                   the Art of Monet in the 1890s.&#8221; Monet&#8217;s technique                   was problematic in that he privileged color (feminine) over                   line (masculine), thus pushing his sexual identity into a grey                   area. Callen illustrates how scientific studies of light and                   optics in the nineteenth century saved Monet from being &#8220;feminized.&#8221;                   Using Monet&#8217;s <em>Grainstacks</em> and <em>Poplars</em>,                   Callen shows that the privilege and power of seeing and looking                   was a male prerogative; Monet &#8220;saw&#8221; nature, and                   he imposed order on &#8220;feminine colour&#8221; through the                   privilege of (male) sight and the light that organizes his compositions                   (31). She refers to Paul Tucker&#8217;s studies on Monet&#8217;s                   <em>Series</em> paintings, but surprisingly, makes no mention                   of Norma Broude&#8217;s <em>Impressionism: A Feminist Reading:                   The Gendering of Art, Science, and Nature in the Nineteenth                   Century</em> (New York: Rizzoli 1991; Westview Press; Reprint                   edition, 1997) which is pertinent to her topic.</p>                <p class="second"> Two of the essays deal directly with female                   artists. Anne Helmreich, in her straightforward, readable essay                   &#8220;The Marketing of Helen Allingham: The English Cottage                   and National Identity&#8221; describes how Allingham managed                   to swing a successful career and family within the social codes                   of her time. Allingham (1848-1926)&#8212;her dates were omitted                   from the text, though her husband&#8217;s dates and the date                   of her marriage were included&#8212;was an English watercolorist                   of cottages in the landscape. The other writer on women artists                   is Jo Anna Isaak, who devotes her essay, &#8220;Trash: Public                   Art by the Garbage Girls,&#8221; to female sculptors who created                   art out of trash in the landscape. This was an insightful essay                   about the positive impact of transforming waste into something                   aesthetic and meaningful, though it is weakened by Isaak&#8217;s                   lengthy introduction on the psychoanalysis of feces and art.                   She does this &#8220;in order both to establish women&#8217;s                   credentials in the field of garbology and to suggest why women                   are strategically so well positioned to deal with the trash.&#8221;                   (p. 177) Is it really necessary to prove that women in general                   are in a good position to make art out of garbage? Once she                   actually reaches her discussion of artists like Agnes Denes                   and Mierle Laderman Ukeles, the tone of the essay becomes more                   persuasive.</p>                <p class="second"> Several other authors discuss women in the                   landscape rather than women landscape artists. Jane Beckett&#8217;s                   &#8220;In the Bleaching Fields: Gender, Landscape and Modernity                   in The Netherlands 1880-1920,&#8221; outlines the redefinition                   of Dutch landscape from 1880 to 1920. She begins with the Dutch                   maid as the nationalistic image of the Netherlands, and then                   points out the attempt by Dutch artists to paint distinctly                   Dutch landscapes that were disappearing due to industrialization.                   Images of cleanliness, thought to be characteristically &#8220;Dutch,&#8221;                   evolved out of the desire to create a nationalistic image, but                   by the end of the time period in question, the presence of the                   female was eliminated and the landscape was abstracted. Like                   Jane Beckett, Sighle Bhreathnach-Lynch discusses landscape and                   gender, though her topic is post-colonial Ireland. In &#8220;Landscape,                   Space and Gender: Their Role in the Construction of Female Identity                   in Newly Independent Ireland,&#8221; Bhreathnach-Lynch begins                   with a discussion of the chaste image of the Irish mother. The                   cottage later replaces the Irish mother as a sign of gender,                   cottages being the domain of women. Examples of this are the                   painted landscapes with cottages produced by the unofficial                   artist of the new state, Paul Henry. Bhreathnach-Lynch ends                   with a consideration of the Virgin Mary, whose statues populated                   the Irish countryside, making her a &#8220;natural&#8221; part                   of the landscape. Pat Simpson&#8217;s essay, &#8220;Soviet Superwoman                   in the Landscape of Liberty: Aleksandr Deineka&#8217;s Razdol&#8217;e,                   1944,&#8221; features a painting depicting athletic women running                   through the countryside. Simpson traces the social meaning of                   the new Soviet woman: the fit, active, vigorous woman needed                   to take over men&#8217;s jobs in agriculture and industry while                   the men were away at war.</p>                <p class="second"> Masculinity in the twentieth century is the                   topic of three of the essays. David Peters Corbett discusses                   Wyndham Lewis and the Vorticists, a group of ostentatiously                   masculine men who were concerned with technology and the landscape                   in &#8220;Landscape, Masculinity and Interior Space Between                   the Wars.&#8221; Caroline Jones uses queer theory and psychoanalysis                   in her essay, &#8220;Robert Smithson&#8217;s Technological Sublime:                   Alterities and the &#8216;Female Earth,&#8217;&#8221; to examine                   Smithson&#8217;s <em>Spiral Jetty</em> in homosexual terms,                   rather than the usual interpretation of man imposing himself                   on mother earth. In &#8220;&#8217;Ain&#8217;t Going Nowhere&#8217;:                   Richard Long: Global Explorer,&#8221; Anna Gruetzner Robins                   discusses the less-than-politically-correct &#8220;colonizing&#8221;                   aspect of Richard Long&#8217;s global explorations, whose travels                   echoed those of male colonial British explorers. </p>                <p class="second"> The one truly refreshing essay in this anthology                   was &#8220;Gender in Perspective: The King and Queen&#8217;s                   Visit to the Panorama in 1793&#8221; by Denise Blake Oleksijczuk,                   who examines the physical reaction (seasickness) of Queen Charlotte                   to Henry Aston Barker&#8217;s Panorama in Leicester Square.                   Oleksijczuk convincingly demonstrates that the queen&#8217;s                   dizziness was due not to her perceived frailty as a woman&#8212;the                   culturally acceptable response&#8212;but to the incorrect perspective                   of the artist&#8217;s rendition of the marine scene. The queen&#8217;s                   reaction to the painting was physiological and could affect                   men and women in the same way.<br>                  Although all of the essays relate to the general theme to some                   extent, several of the essays seem to focus more on figures                   rather than on landscape (Adams, Beckett, Bhreathnach-Lynch,                   Simpson). The point of the conference was to think about landscape                   art and gender, not simply gendered imagery such as Beckett&#8217;s                   Dutch maid or Simpson&#8217;s New Soviet Woman. Given the few                   illustrations in the book, it was difficult, especially with                   the less familiar artists, to make visual connections between                   gender and landscape. (There were no illustrations in Anna Gruetzner                   Robins&#8217; essay on Richard Long!) In addition, there are                   copious notes but a thin bibliography for a scholarly work.                   Regardless, as varied as it is, this anthology provides some                   thought-provoking methodologies, though it only begins to fill                   the gap in the study of landscape and gender.</p>                </td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr> </tr>    <tr> </tr>  </tbody></table></body></html>
