The book is organized chronologically, with                   occasional looks backward. Boettger defines earthworks as &#8220;sculptors&#8217;                   direct manipulations of soil and terrain&#8221; (23). She documents                   earthworks from little-known gestures to early gallery exhibitions                   to large-scale independent projects in remote locations. One                   of the book&#8217;s strengths is the way in which the author                   repositions earthworks in relation to the turbulent social and                   political climate in which they were conceived. Examining their                   relationship to the zeitgeist of the 1960s, particularly to                   the anti-war and the environmental movements, Boettger observes                   that &#8220;earthworks can be retrospectively understood as                   multidimensional and conflicted, ambivalently ecological, political                   and artistic&#8221; (152). She makes room for these contradictions                   throughout the book.</p>                <p class="second">Through detailed documentation, Boettger partially                   debunks the notion that artists created earthworks in order                   to sever ties with the commercialism of the art world. While                   the works were often unsaleable, they were also, in many cases,                   heavily dependent on funding from private sources. In the chapter                   titled &#8220;Nurture and Nature,&#8221; Boettger shows how                   patronage was an essential part of the earth art endeavor, and                   indeed often involved closer relationships between artists and                   patrons than those forged around more traditional media. Boettger                   also challenges the notion that earthworks were the art world&#8217;s                   answer to the back-to-nature movement. The connection between                   earthworks and the environmental movement has been an easy explanation                   for this genre&#8217;s evolution and positive reception. While                   earthworks and the environmental movement occurred simultaneously,                   Boettger shows the connection between them to be complex and                   ambivalent. Earthworks can involve reverence for nature, but                   also the desire to destroy and dominate it. However, critics                   often read earthworks as pastoral, as being &#8220;back to nature,&#8221;                   even when discussing a work as aggressive as Michael Heizer&#8217;s                   <em>Double Negative</em> (1969), or one of Robert Smithson&#8217;s                   non-sites consisting of material taken from an industrial site.                   In tune with the times, critics projected environmentalism and                   ecological commentary onto the work. </p>                <p class="second"> The first chapter begins with a discussion                   of the <em>Hole</em>, a 1967 work by Claes Oldenburg in which                   he had a trench dug and then filled up in the ground of New                   York&#8217;s Central Park. This work is an important departure                   point in the study. Not only was it an early example of artistic                   engagement with earth, but there was an implied anti-war statement                   in Oldenburg&#8217;s grave-like configuration of the piece.                   The timing of the Hole has a particular significance. Robert                   Smithson&#8217;s now legendary drive through New Jersey, resulting                   in his writing of &quot;The Monuments of Passaic&quot; (published                   in <em>Artforum</em> at the end of 1967), took place on the                   same weekend. The pivotal role played by Smithson in the development                   of earthworks is examined throughout the book. The second chapter                   looks at his non-sites, which he first showed at the Dwan Gallery                   in 1968. The third chapter investigates the role played by Smithson&#8217;s                   involvement with T.A.M.S. (Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton),                   a Manhattan-based architectural and engineering firm. Smithson                   became a consultant for T.A.M.S. in 1966 (a few months before                   he made his first contact with Virginia Dwan). He was hired                   to find art works that could be placed out-of-doors, in between                   the runways at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, where they would                   be viewed aerially. In time he encouraged other artists to submit                   proposals to T.A.M.S., including Sol LeWitt, Carl Andre, and                   Robert Morris. Their proposals are discussed in the fourth chapter,                   titled &#8220;The Stimulus of Aerial Art.&#8221; These proposals,                   as Boettger demonstrates, are helpful for understanding each                   artist&#8217;s thinking and contributions to the practice of                   earthworks.</p>                <p class="second"> Chapter Five, &#8220;The West as Site and Spirit,&#8221;                   provides an account of the importance of the western United                   States for &#8220;earthworkers.&#8221; Many of the artists creating                   earthworks in America had personal ties to the West, although                   they were pursuing careers on the East Coast. The mystique of                   the West, an entrenched aspect of American culture, made the                   region strongly attractive to critics and patrons as well. Boettger                   examines Heizer&#8217;s association with New York businessman                   Robert Scull, his major patron. She points out the embrace in                   the Eastern press of Heizer&#8217;s &#8220;Marlboro Man&#8221;                   cowboy image. </p>                <p class="second"> Chapters Six and Seven look at pioneering gallery                   exhibitions of earthworks. &quot;Earth Works&quot;, the landmark                   1968 Dwan Gallery show, was the first group presentation of                   the early form of earthworks. Held at the gallery&#8217;s prominent                   Fifty-seventh Street location in New York City, the exhibition                   included the work of ten American male artists. This exhibition                   was followed in 1969 by &quot;Earth Art&quot; at Cornell University,                   in Ithaca New York. Guest-curated by Willoughby Sharp, the Cornell                   exhibition included many of the same artists as the Dwan Gallery                   exhibition. However, Sharp also included Jan Dibbets and Richard                   Long, important Europeans whose work would have fit in with                   the earlier exhibition as well. Sharp wanted to correct the                   nationalistic chauvinism of the Dwan show. Throughout the book,                   Boettger herself seeks to correct a historically imbalanced                   focus on American earthworks. She explores European correspondences                   to the American use of natural and organic materials, including                   Arte Povera and other contemporaneous parallels. At times the                   transition between her discussion of the American works and                   the European works is weak, and the switches between the United                   States and Europe occasionally detract from the flow of the                   narrative. But ultimately the importance of including a broader                   international picture overrides these issues. </p>                <p class="second">Earthworks flourished in America during an era                   in which there was a great sense of openness and limitless possibility.                   This was gradually replaced by disappointment; a bleaker outlook                   that also affected the art world. The auction of Robert Scull&#8217;s                   art collection in 1973 is cited in the book as an indication                   of the end of an era, as huge prices pushed up the market for                   cutting edge works, turning it into big business. Earthworks                   changed as well, becoming more institutionalized and commission-driven.                   The terminology itself changed, becoming the broader category                   of Land Art. Boettger concludes with the ambiguities and contradictions                   that she has demanded we accept throughout the book: earthworks                   &#8220;refuse to be precious art objects while still being aesthetically                   mediated creations funded by art patrons. They are not about                   nature, but bring viewers closer to it through illustrations                   of their landscapes and direct experience of wilderness locales.                   . . . they can be considered monumental anti-monument memorials&#8221;                   (245). This complex view succeeds in bringing life not only                   to the works, but to the artists who created them, the patrons                   that supported them, and the times in which they were created.</p>                </td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr> </tr>    <tr> </tr>  </tbody></table></body></html>
