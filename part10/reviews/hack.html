<em>American Sublime: Landscape                   Painting in the United States, 1820-1880</em> [Exhibition Catalogue].                   New York: Princeton University Press, 2002. </strong></p>                <p class="second">There are no doubt those&#8212;and by those                   I mean those who clothe themselves in the guilt-ridden cynicism                   of the postmodern academic stance&#8212;who would view the very                   concept of an American Sublime as oxymoronic. It is fair to                   say that for many non-Americanists, American landscape paintings                   of the nineteenth century, for all of their moments of brilliance,                   are relegated to that portion of the mind piled high with butter                   churns, bedwarmers and dust-covered cuspidors: moribund sentimentalities                   from less socially enlightened times. An extraordinary exhibition                   and accompanying catalogue, <em>American Sublime: Landscape                   Painting in the United States, 1820-1880</em>, offers contrary                   and abundant evidence that the wilderness of North and South                   America indeed stirred its artists to that state of mind described                   by Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant (whether you believe that                   Nature itself is sublime or whether the sublime is a mental                   sensation induced by Nature is still up for grabs).</p>                <p class="second"> Organized by the Tate Britain, London (eventually                   the show ventured to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and                   The Minneapolis Institute of Art), &quot;American Sublime&quot;                   assembled some one hundred works by the usual suspects (names                   familiar to Americans, but generally not to the British): Thomas                   Cole, Asher B. Durand, Jasper Francis Cropsey, Frederic Edwin                   Church, John Frederick Kensett, Sanford Robinson Gifford, Martin                   Johnson Heade, Fitz Hugh Lane, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas                   Moran. Accompanying the detailed catalogue entries are two short                   essays by Andrew Wilton (&#8220;The Sublime in the Old World                   and the New&#8221;) and Tim Barringer (&#8220;The Course of                   Empires: Landscape in America and Britain, 1820-1880). Brief                   but useful biographies of these and other artists are also provided,                   compiled by Graham C. Boettcher.</p>                <p class="second"> Wilton&#8217;s starting point in &#8220;The                   Sublime of the Old World and the New,&#8221; naturally, is a                   discussion of Edmund Burke&#8217;s concept of the sublime as                   understood by nineteenth-century Americans who found themselves                   face-to-face with unspoiled Nature in all its splendor, such                   as Lieutenant William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame). A distinct                   variety of the sublime&#8212;that of reverential awe rather                   than the loneliness or angst often associated with works by                   Caspar David Friedrich or Carl Carus&#8212;is, as the book points                   out, more in line with British sensibilities. Far from sentimental,                   however, the works in <em>American Sublime</em> explore that                   reverence in often exhilarating ways.</p>                <p class="second"> In his assessment of the sublime, Wilton deftly                   details the transformation of priorities from history painting                   to landscape; J.M.W. Turner, in insisting that his large canvases                   be hung low so as to bring the viewer more directly into his                   tempests and snowstorms, serves as a crucial precursor to the                   American sublime (an interesting accompanying exhibit at the                   PAFA related the work of Turner to that institution). Oft-heard                   terms such as Hudson River School (a geographically constrictive                   term coined, according to painter Worthington Whittredge, by                   a derisive critic) and Luminism (never a unified movement) are                   questioned as to their usefulness. Nor, he points out, were                   those touted as Luminists&#8212;as far as can be discerned&#8212;ever                   true adherents of the transcendental movement. As Wilton points                   out, however, they shared with Emerson a sense that it is the                   &#8220;city-dweller&#8221; who will come to understand and appreciate                   the sublime aspects of Nature&#8212;that the ascent from rural                   denizen to urban sophisticate ushers in the ability to comprehend                   the enormity of the truths being revealed.</p>                <p class="second"> Technique is given primacy over labels. Wilton                   maintains that much of American landscape painting is characterized                   by a &#8220;pragmatic building up of the picture surface touch                   by touch which varies greatly in effect from painter to painter,                   but which rarely obtrudes itself as a distinctly painterly &#8216;style,&#8217;&#8221;                   which often &#8220;strikes unaccustomed eyes as dry and academic.&#8221;                   He admits, however, that American painters are comparable to                   European academic painters of the period and that regardless                   of a lack of &#8220;eloquent brio,&#8221; painters such as Cole                   and Church created powerful statements in search of the sublime.                   It was this ongoing quest for sublime experience that led these                   artists to the Catskills, Ecuador, and the American West. The                   interest in &#8220;wilderness&#8221;&#8212;wherever found&#8212;unites                   these artists, who sought their inspiration far from an urban                   existence ever growing in complexity and industrialization.</p>                <p class="second"> Tim Barringer, in &#8220;The Course of Empires:                   Landscape in America and Britain, 1820-1880,&#8221; further                   discusses the development of American landscape painting in                   Jacksonian America in terms of a parallel rise in the genre                   in Britain. Several of the artists in question, of course, were                   born in Britain&#8212;Joshua Shaw, Thomas Cole and Thomas Moran.                   Barringer makes the argument that Cole&#8217;s <em>Course of                   Empire</em> is not, as generally thought, an allegory of Jacksonian                   America&#8217;s imperial aspirations (as Alan Wallach has argued),                   but of Britain&#8217;s (that would certainly help explain the                   presence of a Stonehenge-like cromlech in the second work in                   the series, <em>The Arcadian State</em>). It has been suggested                   that Cole devised the series after a particularly unpleasant                   stay in England in 1829.</p>                <p class="second"> The catalogue itself (as well as the exhibition                   at PAFA) moves thematically&#8212;almost in the tradition of                   Cole&#8217;s serial paintings. From categories ranging from                   &#8220;Wilderness&#8221; and &#8220;The Course of Empire&#8221;                   to &#8220;Explorations&#8221; and &#8220;The Great West,&#8221;                   <em>American Sublime</em> sets out to move beyond the concepts                   of Hudson River School and Luminism to redefine American landscape                   painting in terms of themes inherent to these artists, who all                   sought the sublime in various ways. Especially valuable is the                   catalogue&#8217;s exploration of how the notion of the sublime                   developed from British-inspired landscapes to inherently American                   views, such as Moran&#8217;s <em>Grand Canyon of the Colorado</em>                   (1892).</p>                <p class="second"> An interesting and debatably meaningful connection                   is missed, however&#8212;Edmund Burke, as well as Lewis and                   Clark, Thomas Cole and Albert Bierstadt, belonged to the Masonic                   fraternity. As holders of the &#8220;Sublime Degree of Master                   Mason&#8221; (the highest of the three degrees), they would                   have undergone the initiations and teachings of the Craft of                   Freemasonry&#8212;infused with Enlightenment ideals&#8212;that                   are designed to instill in the initiate a sense of wonder and                   awe with Nature. The term &#8220;sublime&#8221; began to be                   used in conjunction with Masonry at the beginning of the nineteenth                   century. The second degree, &#8220;Fellowcraft,&#8221; is particularly                   designed to foster the study and admiration of science and Nature.                   <br>                  This is not to suggest that their experiences as artists were                   wholly shaped by their training as Freemasons, for as De Witt                   Clinton, himself a Grand Master of the Masons in the State of                   New York, noted:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="second"> &#8230;the cultivation of science, the embellishments                     of taste, and the sublime and beautiful work of art, have                     certainly existed in ancient, as they now do in modern times,                     without the agency of Freemasonry. </p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second">Nevertheless, the fraternity certainly promoted                   the study of the natural world, in terms not unlike those of                   other descriptions of the sublime. In its description of the                   charges of the Fellowcraft degree, Cornelius Moore&#8217;s <em>The                   Craftsman and Freemason&#8217;s Guide</em> (1859) suggests that:</p>                <blockquote>                  <p class="maintext"> &#8230;and intimate acquaintance with the                     great book of nature will show you the wisdom, power and beneficence                     of the Creator; it will teach you lessons of humility, fervency,                     faith and charity, and fit you to play your part in the drama                     of human life, with honor to yourself, and with credit to                     the fraternity. </p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second">The trouble with&#8212;and strength of&#8212;the                   American wilderness was that it was free of &#8220;associations&#8221;                   with European culture and history; imagination was required                   of American artists to translate their perceptions into spiritually                   meaningful paintings. One could venture to say that America                   created its own interpretation of the sublime, different than                   its European counterparts; basing their perceptions on geological                   insights and spiritual awakenings in the midst of pure wilderness,                   these artists&#8212;as <em>American Sublime</em> so powerfully                   reveals&#8212;nevertheless sought to invoke a sense of awe without                   the angst.</p>                <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>                <p class="second"><a href="hack_bio.html" class="linkbody">Author's                   Bio&gt;&gt;</a><br>                  &nbsp; </p></td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center">          <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="../index.html">P<em>ART</em></a></font><a href="../index.html"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            home </font></a></p>          </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy; 	  2002 P<i>ART</i> and Melody Davis.
