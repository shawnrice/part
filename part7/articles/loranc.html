Fuller claimed that in May 1928 the organization completely               dismissed the 4D House, his first project for a mass-produced, prefabricated               house. According to Fuller, the AIA's reaction to the 4D House was               so vicious that it immediately passed the following disclaimer:               &quot;Be it resolved that the American Institute of Architects establish               itself on record as inherently opposed to any peas-in-a-pod-like               reproducible designs.&quot;<sup>1</sup> However, forty-two years later in June               1970, the AIA awarded Fuller its gold medal especially for the geodesic               dome which was described in the citation as &quot;the design of               the strongest, lightest and most efficient means of enclosing space               yet devised by man.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In the interval between the AIA's dismissal               and acceptance of his work Fuller produced some other designs for               housing, of which the 1944-46 Dymaxion Dwelling Machine (popularly               called the Wichita House) is the most notable.<sup>3</sup> Although the formal               properties of his housing designs were varied, most were circular               and Fuller's design concept for each was the same: use of industrial               processes and mass-produced, prefabricated, standardized components               to create living environments.<sup>4</sup> In 1970 the AIA was ostensively               rewarding Fuller for his life's work, but, its emphasis was on Fuller's               innovative use of structure and materials, not the principles underlying               it nor his unconventional housing designs.</p>            <p class="second">Fuller's insistence that industrial processes, not 			  aesthetics, control his design strategy places him in an unusual 			  position within twentieth century architecture.<sup>5</sup> His 			  interest in applying industrial methods and standardization to housing 			  affirms his affinity to International Style architects, such as 			  Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier, who also advocated 			  the use of mass-production and prefabrication in housing. Although 			  Gropius was the most active of these three in attempting to design 			  manufactured housing, Fuller considered him, as he did most architects, 			  to be an &quot;exterior decorator&quot; whose work &quot;was trivial 			  since it did not seek to fulfill the need for shelter from an engineering 			  viewpoint, and without confirming to the demands of style or tradition.&quot;<sup>6</sup> 			  Fuller believed that industrial methods and standardization were 			  used primarily to package the house in a stylish envelope. With 			  the design of the Dymaxion House, he reconfigured the house it into 			  a radial plan with a metal and plastic exterior. Therefore, although 			  Fuller's attitude toward mass-production and prefabrication paralleled 			  the interests of International Style architects, his unusual design 			  concepts have prompted most historians to categorize them as fantasy 			  or futuristic architecture.<sup>7</sup></p>            <p class="second">Even though Fuller was not a trained architect,<sup>8</sup>               he did intend that his designs serve as practical solutions to housing               problems, not as imaginative exercises. As explained earlier, he               was disdainful of most architects because he felt that their approach               to housing was inhibited by their fidelity &quot;to the demands               of style or tradition.&quot; In terms of housing, the only traditions               to which Fuller conformed were those of providing shelter and comfort.               He further believed that houses should enrich the lives of their               inhabitants. These guidelines motivated Fuller to conceptualize               the house as a demountable, radial container designed to facilitate               everyday life.<sup>9</sup> His designs were intended to offer a feasible way               to apply the principles of industrial production to housing even               though they were not bound by the stylistic conventions of architecture               nor its history.</p>            <p class="second">Fuller claimed he discovered how resistant &quot;exterior               decorators&quot; could be to his ideas in May 1928 when he presented               the 4D House to the AIA at its 61st convention in St. Louis.<sup>10</sup> Fuller               was promoting the house as the answer to the need for affordable               housing and offered it as a complimentary gift to the association.               This was a generous but naive gesture since its design was amateurish               and awkward. The timing was also very bad because Milton Medary,               the AIA president, opened the convention with an address criticizing               &quot;a growing tendency to standardize architectural design.&quot;<sup>11</sup>               In addition, the AIA board of directors released a report stating:               &quot;It is quite possible that certain functions of the architect               may well become standardized, but what of the art of design? Can               one seriously consider the standardization of the drama, of literature,               of music, or arts kindred to our own such as painting and sculpture?               There is even now becoming evident in our work from coast to coast[...]a               universal product made to sell.&quot;<sup>12</sup> Unfortunately for Fuller,               his 4D House was a design for a mass-produced, prefabricated home               &quot;made to sell,&quot; precisely the type of structure the AIA               was strongly criticizing and publicly opposing. Even if the 4D House               had been a well-conceived design, given the opening statements of               its president, the AIA could not have accepted it. Fuller was disappointed               by the AIA's response but was not deterred from his goal of using               industry and technology to produce housing.</p>            <p class="second">After the AIA convention, Fuller began a personal               crusade to accomplish this goal. He immediately self-published his               manifesto, <i>4D Time Lock</i>, 1928,<sup>13</sup> contacted the press and began to               draw upon his network of business contacts, friends, and supporters               to help promote his project.<sup>14</sup> He redesigned the house and prepared               to take his idea directly to the public. During the preparations               for this launch the name of the house was changed from '4D' to 'Dymaxion'.<sup>15</sup>               A little less than one year after the convention, the redesigned               and renamed house was given its public debut in April 1929 at the               Marshall Field and Company department store in Chicago.<sup>16</sup></p>            <p class="second">There were few similarities between the designs               of the two houses. Both were to be industrially manufactured and               assembled from standardized components. In contrast to the fenestrated               walls of the 4D House, the walls of the Dymaxion House were transparent               plastic, fig. 1. Whereas 4D was a rectangular, two-story, central               mast house only slightly raised above the ground, the Marshall Field               model of the Dymaxion House was a hexagonal, one-story, central               mast structure suspended a full-floor above ground level and stabilized               with steel cables. The central mast, which was celebrated in the               Dymaxion House but seemed like an afterthought in the 4D House,               served as a utility core in both. Numerous household appliances               and mechanical systems were incorporated into each to make housework               less strenuous.<sup>17</sup></p>            <p class="second">These innovations were also incorporated into the               second model of the Dymaxion House which was made between sometime               between May 1929 and March 1930.<sup>18</sup> Unlike the first rickety, paper               model, the sturdy new version was constructed of shiny aluminum               and transparent plastic; if manufactured the house was to be made               of inflatable duraluminum and casein, fig. 2. It was also sleeker               than the first model with a narrower living space supporting a roof               deck and covering a parking area.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="loranc_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/loranc_2a.jpg" width="141" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="loranc_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b> Photograph of the second model of the Dymaxion House,                     no date, approx. 5&quot; x 7&quot;; Courtesy, The Estate of                     Buckminster Fuller, Sebastopol, CA and Courtesy of Department                     of Special Collections, Stanford Universities Libraries, Stanford,                     CA.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Since it was of metal and looked machine-made, the               new model better illustrated Fuller's principles of mass-production,               prefabrication and industrial processes.<sup>19</sup> He felt that               metal was the modern tool.<sup>20</sup> He also believed that metal               should determine the processes of production and the approach to               design. Therefore, a house should be designed to have as many elements               as possible made of metal, shaped by a machine, prefabricated and               mass-produced. In other words, a house should be designed and produced               like a car out of factory-made parts. With the 1929 version of the               Dymaxion House Fuller had realized a more appropriate prototype               for the adaptation of industrial methods of production to housing.</p>            <p class="second">Fuller, as previously stated, shared this interest               with many of his contemporaries although he disapproved of their               use of mass-production, prefabrication and industrial processes.               He was particularly critical towards the work of Gropius, Mies,               Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. Although each had made important               contributions to housing by the late 1920s, Fuller thought they               failed to set new standards for both its design and production.               He believed that they, like most architects, relied upon the machine               to replicate or replace handwork; that they did not permit the machine               to control the construction process. Fuller thought they designed               with clean, simple forms which accommodated machine movement or               appeared to be machine-made and this was merely changing the appearance               of a building, not changing how it was made. He also felt they designed               with some prefabricated and standardized parts which were incorporated               into the finished structure, again affecting composition more than               method.<sup>21</sup> To Fuller, such techniques added elements of               industrialization to the craft-labor construction process but were               technologically conservative and did not significantly alter it.               In Fuller's mind, Wright, Gropius, Mies and Corbusier were transferring               the hand-production based Arts and Crafts aesthetic of the 19th               century to machine production in the 20th. Their understanding of               architecture was based on education and on-the-job training unlike               Fuller who learned what he described as &quot;craft building&quot;<sup>22</sup>               as President of the Stockade Building System. This was a patented               system of construction using fibrous building blocks. Fuller formed               the company with his father-in-law, James Monroe Hewlett and was               its president from 1922 to 1927.<sup>23</sup> In addition, Fuller               knew and read many important architectural texts of the time. His               practical experience was more limited than that of the architects               he criticized, but, in combination with his knowledge of contemporary               writing, it fueled his ambition to apply industrial methods to the               housing industry.<br>            </p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="loranc_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/loranc_3a.jpg" width="129" height="185" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="loranc_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> Page 3 of unpublished reference list for <i>4D TimeLock</i>,                     1928.

Yet, the unpublished reference               list for <i>4D Time Lock</i> is a lengthy roster of important writings,               fig. 3. There are no references to Mies and Gropius, but, the 1927               English edition of Corbusier's <i>Towards a New Architecture</i>               and Wright's essay &quot;What &quot;Styles&quot; Mean to the Architect,&quot;               <i>Architectural Record</i>, February 1928, are included.<sup>24</sup>               Given Fuller's insistence that Wright was privileging style over               process, it is surprising that Fuller does not list Wright's essay               &quot;Art and Craft of the Machine,&quot; 1901. In this essay Wright               argued that the machine be used to free the artist from the drudgery               of handwork. He thought it was fine to use the machine to produce               the components of a building but the design and appearance should               still be determined by the architect's aesthetic sensibilities.<sup>25</sup>               Wright reinforced this argument in &quot;What &quot;Styles&quot;               Mean to the Architect&quot; by claiming standardization serves as               the impersonal structure with which the architect's personal style               should be integrated. He wrote: &quot;standardization[...]serves               as a kind of warp on which to weave the woof of[...]building.&quot;<sup>26</sup>               In contrast, Fuller proposed that standardization should serve as               the basis for both the structure and design of a building. Although               there are similarities in their approaches, Wright and Fuller differed               in their assessments of the role industrial methods should play               in architecture. Fuller's inclusion of &quot;What &quot;Styles&quot;               Mean to the Architect&quot; in his reference list may have been               to demonstrate that his own theory of design was related to, but               different from, the philosophy of one of architecture's leaders.</p>            <p class="second"> This may also have been Fuller's motivation for               including Corbusier's <i>Towards a New Architecture</i> on the reference               list. Unlike &quot;What &quot;Styles&quot; Mean to the Architect,&quot;               Fuller provides an evaluation of this source in a letter he wrote               to his sister Rosamond on August 11, 1928. In it he claimed that               he and Corbusier have almost &quot;identical phraseology.&quot;               He wrote that Corbusier was:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">&quot;the great revolutionist in architectural                 design whose book should be read in conjunction with my 4D. My                 own reading of Corbusier's &quot;Towards a New Architecture&quot;,                 at the time when I was writing my own, nearly stunned me by the                 almost identical phraseology of his telegraphic style of notion                 with the notations of my own set down completely from my own intuitive                 searching and reasoning and unaware even of the existence of such                 a man as Corbusier. Corusier [sic] was first called to my attention                 by Russell Walcott, the best of residential designers in Chicago,                 when I was explaining my principles to him last November.&quot;<sup>27</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Walcott may have told Fuller about Corbusier in               November 1927, but, he lent Fuller <i>Towards A New Architecture</i>               the following January. Fuller dutifully noted the act in his diary               on January 30, 1928: &quot;Called on Russell Walcott and borrowed               Le Corbusier's &quot;Towards the New Architecture&quot;[...]RBF               read Le Corbusier until very late at night. Startled at coincidence               of results arrived at in comparison to Fuller Houses but misses               main philosophy of home as against house.&quot;<sup>28</sup> Although Fuller               was criticizing Corbusier for being interested more in the formal               properties of a house than in accommodating the activities that               make it a home, he empathized with Corbusier's philosophy.<sup>29</sup></p>            <p class="second">Whether resulting from &quot;identical phraseology&quot; 			  or direct influence, there are numerous similarities between the 			  ideas presented in <i>4D Time Lock</i> and <i>Towards A New Architecture</i>.<sup>30</sup> 			  Each book called for the use of standardization, prefabrication 			  and mass-production in the building industry. Furthermore, both 			  referred to the automobile industry as a prototype. Fuller often 			  used the analogy of automobile production to support his argument 			  that houses should be mass-produced and not custom-designed. According 			  to him, the cost per automobile decreases as more cars are manufactured 			  which allows the manufacturer to price products according to make 			  and model. He wanted to apply this method to housing. Corbusier, 			  on the other hand, included the idea as almost an offhand comment 			  and without elaboration or instructions. He simply wrote: &quot;I 			  am 40 years old, why should I not buy a house for myself? for I 			  need this instrument; a house built on the same principles as the 			  Ford car I bought (or my Citroen, if I am particular).&quot;<sup>31</sup> 			  Corbusier's comment is so subtle that it is difficult to link it 			  to Fuller's developed argument. Fuller, however, found an corresponding 			  idea in Corbusier's short recommendation.</p>            <p class="second">Corbusier also briefly alluded to another one of               Fuller's major points: the need to reduce the weight of buildings.               Fuller recommended that the weight of buildings be decreased in               order to lower costs and waste. He repeatedly argues this throughout               4D Time Lock and devotes an entire chapter to the subject, <i>Chapter               Nine: Weight in Building as the New Economical Factor</i>. Corbusier,               in the caption for <i>Le Corbusier, 1919</i>, <i>A &quot;Monol&quot;               House</i> succinctly states that &quot;the ordinary house weighs               too much&quot;.<sup>32</sup> The similarity in their thinking is clearer in               this case although the degree to which they dealt with the subject               is again different.</p>            <p class="second">They both believed machines would increasingly be               used in the home to make housework easier, but, they disagreed about               who would reap the benefits. Fuller included mechanical appliances               to ease the drudgery of housekeeping and supply the housewife with               dutiful and competent mechanical servants. He thought mechanical               appliances would replace servants. Corbusier thought machines would               make it possible for servants to work in shifts, like factory workers.               He wrote: &quot;Modern achievement[...]replaces human labour by               the machine and by good organization[...]Servants are no longer               of necessity tied to the house: they come here, as they would a               factory, and do their eight hours; in this way an active staff is               available day and night.&quot;<sup>33</sup> In terms of mechanical appliances,               Fuller and Corbusier are proposing dissimilar applications for similar               technology.</p>            <p class="second">Not surprisingly, they also meant different things               when they proclaimed the need for a new architecture to meet the               needs of modern life. Corbusier wanted to make a &quot;machine for               living in&quot; by using machine processes to achieve aesthetic               results that would please the inhabitant. Fuller wanted a &quot;machine               for living,&quot; a house that would function like a machine to               improve the quality of the life of its inhabitants.<sup>34</sup> Corbusier               wanted to use machine made parts like puzzle pieces to create a               whole whereas Fuller wanted the machine to serve as a model of efficiency.               Corbusier wanted modern architecture to serve as a stage for modern               life; Fuller wanted modern architecture to facilitate modern life.</p>            <p class="second">Fuller and Corbusier were working with related ideas               in their programs for the modern house. But, as the previous comparisons               have shown, they varied in their application and expression of these               ideas. These programs, therefore, led to different possibilities               for architecture as Reyner Banham explained in <i>Theory and Design               in the First Machine Age</i>. He wrote:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">&quot;Fuller had advanced, in his Dymaxion House                 project, a concept of domestic design that[...]had it been built,                 would have rendered [Corbusier's designs...] technically obsolete                 before design had even begun[...]The formal qualities of [the                 Dymaxion House] are not remarkable, except in combination with                 the structural and planning methods involved. The structure does                 not derive from the imposition of a[n...] aesthetic on a material                 that has been elevated to the level of a symbol for 'the machine'[...]The                 planning derives from a liberated attitude to those mechanical                 services that had precipated the whole Modern adventure by their                 invasion of homes and streets before 1914.&quot;<sup>35</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Banham saw in the Dymaxion House potential for a               new type of architecture and in Corbusier's housing designs he found               the updating of existing architectural conventions. Despite their               differences there are still similarities found in their 1920s projects               which demonstrate how easily Fuller could be &quot;[s]tartled at               coincidence of results arrived at in comparison to Fuller Houses&quot;               in Corbusier's book.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="loranc_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/loranc_4a.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="loranc_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> Le Corbusier, Villa Savoye, Poissy, France, 1928-29.                     Digital photograph courtesy of Virginia Smith, New York, NY,                     1999.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">There are also &quot;startling coincidences of results&quot;               found by comparing the mature design of the Dymaxion House to Corbusier's               Villa Savoye, Poissy, France, 1928-29, fig. 4.<sup>36</sup> In each               house the main living area is raised off the ground although Corbusier               used pilotis and Fuller used a central mast. Both houses have horizontal               strip windows but Corbusier treats them like traditional fenestration               which is set into the wall unlike Fuller who treats them as major               components of the wall. Because there is a structural frame in each               house the walls are not load-bearing and the facades free. The roof               of each is utilized: Corbusier transformed it into a roof garden               and Fuller converted it into an upper deck. The houses do, however,               differ in their plans. Corbusier used an orthogonal footprint with               rectangular rooms that connect to one another; Fuller used a radial               plan with triangular rooms that are accessed either at the central               mast or along the outer wall. Thus, although the configuration of               the homes are not alike, many components are treated similarly.</p>            <p class="second">Whether this resulted from coincidence or influence 			  is difficult to determine. With the exception of the central mast, 			  Fuller completely reconfigured his design between its May 1928 presentation 			  to the AIA and the April 1929 exhibition at Marshall Field. Furthermore, 			  it was also drastically redesigned during the production of the 			  second model before March 1930. According to his diary, Fuller read 			  <i>Towards A New Architecture</i> in January 1928 before any of 			  the designs were formulated. The 1929 version more clearly reflected 			  Fuller's ideological program for the house: that it should be prefabricated 			  and mass-produced as well as facilitate the lives of the inhabitants.<sup>37</sup> 			  The new model may also have been intended to illustrate that Fuller 			  knew of contemporary developments in housing design and that he 			  was correcting what he considered to be their shortcomings. Therefore, 			  by designing a house that drew upon current debates (role of the 			  machine, standardization and mass-production in housing) and also 			  drew upon concurrent aesthetics (raising the living areas above 			  the ground, recreational use of the roof and window walls), Fuller 			  was demonstrating his understanding of and desire to improve contemporary 			  design and architectural theory.</p>            <p class="second">There are two other characteristics of the Dymaxion               House which can serve as concluding points of difference and similarity               between Fuller's house and the designs of his colleagues. These               are mobility and assembly. The Dymaxion House was designed to be               mobile in the sense that it could be taken apart, shipped to a new               location and reassembled. Fuller believed mobility represented a               number of ideals including time as the new currency, industrial               production, reduced weight and the American spirit of individualism               and freedom. Although Fuller considered mobility to be an important               consideration of modern housing, he did not design the house to               be transported as a unit. In a process which would have been both               inconvenient and time-consuming, the house was designed to be taken               apart, crated, shipped to the new location and re-assembled.</p>            <p class="second">The method of moving the house was the same as that 			  specified for its delivery from the factory to its original location. 			  The components of the Dymaxion House were designed to be mass-produced 			  and prefabricated in a factory. Then, they were to be crated, shipped 			  to the site and assembled by hand. This is a strange paradox since 			  Fuller insisted upon machine production and allowing industrial 			  processes to determine the design strategy, but, he maintained the 			  traditional reliance upon craft labor to assemble the various components 			  of the house into a finished building. It is also in contrast to 			  his argument that &quot;craft building[...]is an art which belongs 			  in the middle ages.&quot;<sup>38</sup> Fuller, however, believed 			  he needed to use craft labor on site because he thought shipping 			  the assembled house was impractical. He wrote:</p>            <blockquote>              <p class="second">&quot;Of importance[...]was the problem of transporting 				large units of structure[...]entire houses and apartment houses 				must be constructed in factories and delivered as totally assembled 				products, like automobiles. But with existing transportation facilities, 				no house can be moved more than a few miles. It is not practicable 				[sic] to load a house on a flatcar or a trailer and transport 				it through city streets, under and over bridges, and through tunnels. 				It is theoretically possible, to deliver a full-size, pre-assembled 				house by air.&quot;<sup>39</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Although Fuller's decision to ship the house as 			  a kit was based on practical considerations, it was also similar 			  to the role that Mies van der Rohe thought mass-production and prefabrication 			  would play in the housing industry. In 1924 Mies predicted that 			  &quot;industrial production of all the parts can really be rationalized 			  only in the course of the manufacturing process, and work on the 			  site will be entirely a matter of assembly.&quot;<sup>40</sup> It is doubtful 			  Fuller would have known of Mies' prediction since it was published 			  in the German magazine G.<sup>41</sup> While Fuller and Mies were 			  considering the issues of construction from two different vantage 			  points, their conclusions are remarkably similar. This may have 			  resulted from their common knowledge of architectural theory or 			  it may have been another instance of &quot;startling coincidences 			  of results.&quot;</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="loranc_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/loranc_5a.jpg" width="169" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="loranc_5.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     5:</b> Anne Hewlett Fuller, <i>Untitled Painting of Dymaxion                     House and Dymaxion Car</i>, no date, approx. 24&quot; x 36&quot;;                     Courtesy, The Estate of Buckminster Fuller, Sebastopol, CA                     and Courtesy of Department of Special Collections, Stanford                     Universities Libraries, Stanford, CA.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Despite the &quot;startling coincidences of results,&quot; 			  Fuller believed Mies and other architects of the 1920s did not fully 			  explore the potentials of the machine and industrial production 			  in their housing designs. Buckminster Fuller believed the only way 			  to design houses was to do so according to industrial methods of 			  production and machine processes. In addition, he espoused that 			  materials appropriate for industrial production, especially metal 			  and plastic, were to be used. He established these criteria between 			  1928 and 1929 in the development of his first project for a mass-produced 			  house, the 4D/Dymaxion House. These criteria were the foundation 			  upon which Fuller built his design strategy for housing. This was 			  a strategy based upon production, not aesthetics. As he wrote in 			  <i>4D Time Lock</i>, &quot;nostalgia for past values and aesthetics 			  are not allowed to interfere with the industrially produced house.&quot;<sup>42</sup> 			  Fuller was proclaiming that new methods of production would produce 			  a new type of modern housing with its own system of aesthetics, 			  reflecting its time and methods of production without being tethered 			  to those of the past.</p>            <p class="second"><a href="loranc_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="../ed_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../gr/parthome.gif" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&copy;       2001 P<i>ART</i> and Loretta Lorance.
