The 4D House is, by nature, a living environment.               This aspect of the geodesic dome is often overlooked since it is               usually employed for industrial or commercial applications. Fuller               considered the geodesic dome to be an environmental valve that could               &quot;envelop living quarters, gardens, lawns, acres or cities&quot;               and could cause &quot;the conventional house to become, if not obsolete,               at least increasingly superfluous.&quot; (<i>The Dymaxion World               of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p. 65)</p>            <p class="second">5. In the introduction to <i>Forget Fuller?</i>,               <i>ANY</i> No. 17, Reinhold Martin describes the ambivalent attitude               of the architectural profession toward Fuller: &quot;The architectural               establishment treated Fuller with a mixture of deference and skepticism               during his lifetime, despite his prodigious achievements. He endured               rejection at the hands of the American Institute of Architects early               in his career, only to be celebrated in the inaugural issue of <i>Perspecta</i>               in 1952 as one of three &quot;new directions&quot; in architecture,               along with Philip Johnson and Paul Rudolph. Whereupon Johnson in               turn acknowledged a certain respect for Fuller even as he dismissed               him as a delirious technician in &quot;The Seven Crutches of Modern               Architecture,&quot; published two years later in the same journal.&quot;               (<i>ANY</i>, No. 17, 1997, p. 15)</p>            <p class="second">6.

For typical treatments of Fuller's work see Kenneth               Frampton, <i>Modern Architecture: A Critical History</i>, 3rd ed.,               1992, which discusses Fuller's work as an alternative to modernist               architecture; William J.R. Curtis, <i>Modern Architecture Since               1900</i>, 3rd ed., 1996; and Reyner Banham, <i>Theory and Design               in the First Machine Age</i>, 1960, which praises Fuller's use of               technology. Fuller's designs, especially the Dymaxion House and               the Wichita House, are usually treated as prototypes for futuristic               housing as in <i>Yesterday's Houses of Tomorrow: Innovative American               Homes 1850 to 1950</i>, H. Ward Jandl and others, 1991.</p>            <p class="second">8. Fuller had no professional training in any field               and described himself as an anticipatory comprehensive designer               which means he was a generalist trying to use present technology               to anticipate future needs. (<i>BuckyWorks</i>, pp. 62-65) He did               receive &quot;limited formal education&quot; at the U.S. Naval Academy               in Annapolis, MD, where he spent &quot;a few months&quot; in 1917.               (<i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p. 13, and <i>BuckyWorks</i>,               p.4)</p>            <p class="second">9. Fuller used mathematics to justify his radial               or circular design: the shortest distance between two points is               a straight line. A circular configuration is preferred because in               a circle there is a consistent distance, the diameter, from the               center to all points on the perimeter. In a house with a radial               plan all parts would be quickly and easily accessed from the center.               Therefore, this configuration would help its inhabitants save time               which he believed was the most important commodity of modern living.               Fuller believed time was replacing gold as the economic standard:               &quot;Without legislation recognizing it, the world is now on a               time standard instead of a gold standard in temporal things. Wasting               time is exactly the same as throwing away gold used to be. Therefore,               we are forced to design and figure in the fourth dimension which               is time.&quot; (R. Buckminster Fuller, <i>4D Time Lock</i>, Chicago:               The Author, 1928, p. 10) There is second explanation on page 15               and a third on page 16.</p>            <p class="second">10. No documentation has been found to date to verify               that Fuller actually made the presentation at the 1928 AIA convention.               Drafts of two texts that appear to be the speech he could have given               to the AIA and a rejoinder he wrote upon his return are in Volume               33 of the <i>Chronofile</i>. As far as appreciating Fuller's contributions               to architecture, architects, historians and critics differ widely               in their evaluation of Fuller's significance. The misunderstanding               of his intentions still evokes dismissal of his work. For example,               in what the publishers describe as a &quot;pioneering critical survey               of the most significant European and North American statements of               architectural theory,&quot; Hanno-Walter Kruft writes: &quot;With...Fuller...we               find all conventional concepts of architecture scattered to the               winds. Fuller saw architecture as applied technology &#151; an arrangement               of universal laws expressed in terms of energy, mathematics, rationality...Fuller's               lightweight constructions serve a function as large temporary buildings               for exhibitions and similar purposes but they cannot be considered               as architecture, nor should the principles behind them be considered               as relevant to architecture.&quot; (<i>A History of Architectural               Theory from Vitruvius to the Present</i>, New York: Princeton Architectural               Press, 1994, pp. 438-9). Curiously, Kruft seems to have included               Fuller simply to discredit him. If the two references to Fuller               listed in the bibliography and footnotes are his primary sources               of information, it is easy to understand Kruft's misreading of him.</p>            <p class="second">11. <i>Cities Becoming 'Peas of One Pod,'</i> p.               5.</p>            <p class="second">12.

Walker, Christopher Morley, and the presidents of Harvard University,               M.I.T. and the University of Chicago.

The <i>Chronofile</i> documents the extensive               network of acquaintances in the architectural and building professions               Fuller developed as President of Stockade Building System. Stockade               was acquired by the Celotex Company in 1927 after Hewlett sold his               shares and Fuller was forced out. (<i>Chronofile</i>, Vols. 27-32,               1923-1927)</p>            <p class="second">15'Dymaxion' is a combination of 'dynamism,' 'maximum,'               and 'ion.' Fuller claimed that the word 'dymaxion' was the result               of a collaborative effort between himself and Waldo Warren, an advertising               specialist. To date, no confirmation or contradiction has been found               in either Fuller's or Marshall Field's archives. For an account               of the process through which 'Dymaxion' was developed see <i>The               Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p. 21.</p>            <p class="second">16. Marshall Field asked Fuller to display the model               in the Interior Design galleries because the store was promoting               furniture recently purchased in Europe. Fuller claimed that the               store's intention was to make the 'advanced design' of the furniture               appear conservative in relation to the design of the house. (<i>The               Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p. 21) There is a two-minute               clip in the movie <i>Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud</i> (Simon               &amp; Goodman, 1997) that shows Fuller presenting the model. In               the movie, Antonio Salemme, a sculptor, explains that Fuller made               the model in six months while staying in Salemme's Greenwich Village               studio and then presented it to the Architectural League. Salemme               must be talking about the second model for the Dymaxion House even               though the clip shows the model displayed at Marshall Field. Fuller               was living in Chicago when the first model was made and did not               move to New York until after April 1929.

This calculation is based on the fact that the               first model was exhibited at the Harvard Society for Contemporary               Art from May 20-25, 1929, and the second model was exhibited in               the same gallery from March 12-14, 1930. (<i>Chronofile</i>, Vol.               35, 1929 and Vol. 37, 1930)</p>            <p class="second">19. This second model is the one that is most well-known               and its metallic, spaceship-like appearance is one aspect that contributed               to its being classified as fantastic or futuristic. Although the               use of aluminum for the frame (such as the 1931 Aluminaire House               by A.L Kocher and A. Frey) or for the cladding of a building (most               notably Otto Wagner's Die Zeit, 1902) was explored, the convention               of an orthogonal footprint was maintained unlike Fuller's hexagonal               living area suspended above the ground from the central mast. In               addition, there are a number architects who have investigated the               possibilities of a central mast building throughout the twentieth               century including Frank Lloyd Wright (St. Marks Tower Project, 1929,               and Johnson Wax Research Tower, Racine, WI, 1949), George Keck (House               of Tomorrow, Michigan City, IN, 1933), Richard Neutra and Peter               Pfisterer (Diatom-One-Plus-Two House Project, 1926). A second factor               strongly contributing to the relegation of the Dymaxion House to               the realm of futuristic housing was the inclusion of the numerous               appliances and mechanical systems. This was not as fantastic as               critics and historians claim. Although some of the appliances Fuller               specified, especially the 3-minute laundry unit, were too complicated               for production in the late 1920s, the majority of the appliances               and systems Fuller included were available. (See my article <i>Promises,               Promises: Household Appliances in the 1920s, Part 3: Architecture</i>,               June 1998)</p>            <p class="second">20. According to Fuller: &quot;The new tool of this               age is metal from which has been born mechanics or directed mechanical               motion, which is governed fourth dimensional design. It is metal               that has made possible the automobile, the railroad, the airplane,               telephone, wireless, the clothes on our back and all our food, our               city skyscraper. Generally, and structurally speaking, we use it               in our houses in the form of nails only. Structurally the characteristic               of the new tool, metal, different from any of the tools of other               ages, is its fibre or tensile strength, tremendously in excess of               any other tensile unit ever created.&quot; (<i>4D Time Lock</i>,               p. 4, italics in the original)</p>            <p class="second">21. This is somewhat ironic because, except for               the geodesic dome, Fuller intended that his houses be taken apart,               crated and shipped to the site for assembly by hand when relocated.               Ideally, the geodesic dome would be flown to its new site. See note               39 below.</p>            <p class="second">22. <i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>,               p. 13.</p>            <p class="second">23. Fuller claimed that his understanding of architecture               and building was learned from practical experience only and primarily               during his years at Stockade: &quot;That is when I really learned               the building business...And the experience made me realize that               craft building &#151; in which each house is a pilot model for a               design which never has any runs &#151; is an art which belongs in               the middle ages.&quot; (<i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>,               p. 13)</p>            <p class="second">24. Fuller's knowledge of 1920s architecture and               architectural theory was much more greater than he admitted. In               Vol. 34 of the Chronofile is a five-page reference list for 4D Time               Lock. Although it cannot be known how many of these items Fuller               actually read, the fact that he included them indicates his familiarity               with the architectural currents of the 1920s. These two are items               number 4 and 56 on his reference list. (<i>Chronofile</i>, Vol.               34, 1928)</p>            <p class="second">25. Wright first presented &quot;The Art and Craft               of the Machine&quot; as a lecture in 1901. He reworked it into an               essay. In <i>The Cause of Architecture</i> consisted of two separate               series published in <i>Architectural Record</i> during 1927 and               1928, respectively. Wright continued the argument of The Art and               Craft of the Machine in the 1927 series in which he discussed the               pros and cons of the use of the machine, or, as he described it,               &quot;the architect's tool.&quot; In the 1928 series, Wright was               more concerned with design. In both he argued against allowing standardization               to destroy the art of building.</p>            <p class="second">26.

This               idea is expressed in Wright's textile block houses from the first               half of the 1920s, as seen in the 1923 house, La Miniatura, he designed               for Alice Millard. Wright used pre-fabricated and mass-produced               components but in a traditional manner: different elements were               brought together to produce a unified and aesthetic building.</p>            <p class="second">27. <i>4D Time Lock</i>, p. 79. It is not clear               to what Fuller is referring when he describes Corbusier's &quot;telegraphic               style of notion.&quot; It may be that he thought Corbusier was clear               and concise.</p>            <p class="second">28. <i>Chronofile</i>, Vol. 30, 1927-28. Fuller               Houses was the original name of the 4D/Dymaxion House project.

There is no documentation in the <i>Chronofile</i>               for the beginning of the Fuller Houses project. It is first mentioned               on November 22, 1927 in the diary by Fuller's wife, Anne, who noted               that Fuller talked about 'Fuller Houses' with a salesman from Stockade.               (Vol. 30, 1927-28) Therefore, how much influence <i>Towards a New               Architecture</i> might have exerted on Fuller is unknown</p>            <p class="second">30. Only the most significant similarities will               be discussed in this essay. For Le Corbusier, the page numbers in               the following notes are from: <i>Towards A New Architecture</i>,               New York: Dover Publications, 1986.</p>            <p class="second">31. Fuller claimed that &quot;The new Ford cost               approximately $43,000,000 for its first single unit, but on a basis               of an infinity of reproductions, each of the latter cost but $500...Price               varies with models and sizes.&quot; Therefore, Fuller believed,               mass-production would serve to lower the cost of housing in the               same manner: &quot;It was inevitable...that a complete house with               every requirement, industrially to be fashioned, should eventually               be evolved...Tho [sic] it cost 100 million if but one unit were               constructed, the machinery, thereto attendant, and distribution               system having been set up, replicas may be had for close to the               material cost, or on a weight basis as all shipping or machinery               is sold.&quot; (Buckminster Fuller, &quot;Tree-Like Style of Dwelling               Is Planned,&quot; <i>The Chicago Evening Post Magazine of the Art               World</i>, December 18, 1928, p. 5) Le Corbusier briefly mentioned               this under the heading of A question of a new spirit.

Corbusier introduced this phrase in <i>Towards 			  A New Architecture</i>, see p. 4. Although truncating Corbusier's 			  phrase would have been a typical word game for Fuller, &quot;machine 			  for living&quot; is thought to have first been associated with Fuller 			  in the article &quot;Buckminster Fuller: The Dymaxion Architect,&quot; 			  <i>Time</i>, Vol. 83, No. 2, January 10, 1964, p. 48. Amusingly, 			  the article refers to Corbusier's axiom &quot;machine for living 			  in&quot; (machine &agrave; habiter) as &quot;machine-for-living.&quot; 			  Ed Applewhite, who compiled a the four volume <i>Synergetics Dictionary</i>, 			  a catalogue of Fuller's words and sayings, believes &quot;machine 			  for living&quot; was first used relationship to Fuller's work in 			  <i>The Dymaxion Architect</i>.</p>            <p class="second">35.

As with Fuller and the Dymaxion House, the maturation               of the ideas Corbusier expressed in the Villa Savoye resulted from               a long period of development. The Villa Savoye is considered to               be the culmination of ideas which were initiated with Corbusier's               1919-1920 project for the Citrohan House.

Fuller addresses the issue of mobility in <i>4D               Time Lock</i> on page 63 as part of <i>The 4D Letters Patent</i>               where he writes: &quot;In a dwelling intended for quick and easy               and erection and subsequent moving from place to place with relatively               great facility, the weight of the structure itself becomes a significant               item.&quot; A lengthy discussion of mobility is provided in the               reproduction of his August 31, 1928 letter to George Buffington.               The excerpts relevant to the issue of mobility are as follows:</p>            <blockquote>              <p class="second">&quot;[...]4D mobile, lightful, 20th century tower                 housing[...]is a subject of common progressive, harmonic, and                 creative interest[...]4D tower housing represents spirit of freedom                 that is synonymous with American[...]time is new currency, new                 base of economy[...]owning property is feudalistic[...]Economics                 are dependent upon free mobile individualism which is the antithesis                 of static properties[...]With the establishment of the new mobile                 housing industry, will the other industries of automobile, airplane,                 radio, furnishings, etc., no matter how complimentary to the main                 housing, assume the proportions of the motor launches, airplanes,                 and myriad other gear, to the main battleship, being but accessories                 of convenience.&quot; (pp. 120-132)</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">38. <i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>,               p. 13.</p>            <p class="second">39. Ibid., pp. 17-18. In the 1950s, Fuller's ideal               of transporting houses by air was realized when geodesic domes were               transported by helicopters. Fuller was enamored by the technology               of the airplane and the potential he saw in using the sky as a second               &quot;ocean.&quot; According to Fuller, the sky ocean, unlike the               water ocean, completely surrounds the Earth and provides direct               access to all points on it. In terms of using the airplane as a               means of transporting assembled buildings, there are limitations               placed upon the size and weight of the structures. Of course, reducing               the weight of buildings was one of Fuller's design criteria. And,               ground transportation systems do impose limitations upon the design               of mass-produced housing. For example, Allan Wallis argued that               the width of trailers was restricted by the width of highway lanes               in <i>Wheel Estate: The Rise and Decline of Mobile Homes</i>, New               York: Oxford University Press, 1994.</p>            <p class="second">40.
