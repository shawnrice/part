In the 1780s,               Fran&ccedil;ois-Pierre-Ami Argand, a Swiss inventor and philosopher,               developed and introduced an improved lamp burner that revolutionized               interior lighting. Argand, a true child of the Enlightenment, associated               with the leading scientific figures of his day, including James               Watt, Antoine de Lavoisier, the Montgolfier brothers and Joseph               Priestly. His glass chimneyed central draft burner produced light               equal to that of six to eight candles. It also improved oxygenation               at the burner, reduced consumption of oil, and practically eliminated               the need for snuffing (snipping away partially burned wicks to reduce               flickering).</p>            <p class="second">This improved technology immediately affected lighting               devices in the first half of the nineteenth century. In the second               half of the century, this new burner was used with both lighting               and heating devices. Its longer term benefits can still be observed               in the circular burners of contemporary gas cooking stoves. Argand's               new burner led to the development of new lamp forms and eventually               affected both space usage and furniture placement patterns. Interestingly,               even those persons who have understood the specifics of Argand's               contribution to technology have shown little concern for the influence               that his center draft burner had on improving the level of light               in artificially illuminated interior domestic spaces. </p>            <p class="second">Argand's name is generally unknown and recognition               of his contributions to interior lighting has largely been lost               to history. The Franco-phonic name of Ami Argand is almost totally               unknown in France where lamps with central draft technology are               called Quinquets. They are named after Antoine-Arnoult Quinquet,               chemist and pharmacist from Soissons, who used industrial espionage               and trickery to deprive Argand of the fair fruits of his invention               in France. Even those familiar with the appellation &quot;Argand               burner&quot; have known little about the man. This situation has               recently been remedied with the 1999 publication of John J. Wolfe's               <i>Brandy, Balloons and Lamps: Ami Argand, 1750-1803</i>.<br>            </p>            <p class="second">Born in Geneva to a Swiss watchmaker and his wife               on July 5, 1750, Argand was the ninth of ten children. He was well-educated.               His parents intended him for the clergy and enrolled him at the               Auditoire de Philsophie in Geneva. Instead, in 1775 Argand went               to Paris for further study in chemistry and physics, carrying introductions               to Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier. Lavoisier was a brilliant 18th               century French scientist and chemist whose seminal studies involving               oxygen and combustion brought a major change in scientific thinking               about the role of oxygen in combustion. After several years of study               and lecturing, Argand accepted a post in Paris as a teacher of chemistry.               One of his interests concerned the distilling of spirits. In the               1780, while working for a distiller in Languedoc, Argand solved               his need for better light during the night by developing the double-tube,               circular-wick, oil burning lamp with chimney which has come to bear               his name.</p>            <p class="second">Despite the availability of information regarding               a wide variety of scientific advances during the eighteenth century,               no source has been brought forward to suggest that Argand's central               draft technology is other than his own creation. In fact, until               recently, no reliable reference to Argand's life or his work existed.               Wolfe's recent biography of Argand finally redresses this deficiency.               Wolfe has meticulously gathered information which demonstrates that               it was indeed Argand who first succeeded in creating the burner               technology which bears his name. Followers there were aplenty, starting               within months of his original patents, and Argand suffered greatly               from their scurrilous purloining of his techniques. Even Benjamin               Franklin, diplomat and inventor in late eighteenth-century America,               came up with a variation. But Franklin did not include the all important               chimney. Franklin's suggestion remained simply an idea and was not               at all damaging to Argand whose conception was truly a work of genius.</p>            <p class="second">What, exactly, was it that Argand accomplished?               Illumination prior to Argand's central draft burner relied on handmade               candles and a variety of open or partially open oil containers into               which cotton or rush wicks were inserted. The fuels were tallow,               alcohol, and any available oil, including fish, seal, whale and               various vegetable oils. By the latter part of the eighteenth century,               some glass containers with either single or double wicks inserted               into drop-in burners were found in well-to-do homes. Scientific               experiment had demonstrated that two wicks burning side by side               delivered more than twice the illumination derived from two independent               light sources. This knowledge led to the design and use of the drop-in               burners with two side-by-side tubes set atop flint or blown glass               containers. Argand's innovative central draft burner improved greatly               on the principle of the paired wicks. Furthermore, its more complete               combustion greatly reduced the need for snuffing. But, lamps with               these new burners were very expensive and required a fine grade               of oil which made them expensive to maintain. Even with high initial               costs and high maintenance, lamps with central draft burners delivered               high light levels, and this quality made them popular with the middle               and upper classes.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="sherma_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/sherma_1a.jpg" width="130" height="171" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="sherma_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     1:</b> The basic structure of the Argand burner.

Drawing by the author.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Argand made two essential improvements in central               draft burner technology. First, he mounted a cylindrical wick between               two concentric metal tubes. Openings at the base of these tubes               allowed air to reach the burner through the center of the inner               tube as well as from the outside of the outer tube. Second, Argand               improved the draft of this well-oxygenated air with addition of               a tall straight chimney. His first chimneys were made of pierced               metal, but he soon substituted glass chimneys. Flint glass was found               to be preferable for the chimneys because it could withstand the               heat created at the circular burner without cracking. Argand's's               own preference was for blue glass chimneys, possibly because they               reduced the intensity of the light at the burner.</p>            <p class="second">Blue or clear, the chimneys are not simply decorative.               They force the heated gases produced at the burner to rise at an               accelerated rate, allowing fresh, oxygenated air to enter at the               bottom center of the inner tube. The resulting convection lifts               away the carbonated gases produced at the burning wick, enhancing               the efficiency of the burner. The chimney also steadies the flame               and protects it from random drafts. At the same time, the transparency               of the glass allows the greatest dispersion of the light produced               at the burner. Argand is believed to have been the first to employ               a chimney in this way, but almost every subsequent oil-burning lamp               would utilize one. The resulting level of illumination was far brighter               than that from any lamp then known</p>            <p class="second">The oil used with these new burners had to be of               a very fine grade and were costly. The choice was between fine vegetable               oil - usually colza or rapeseed oil in Europe - and whale oil. The               size and prowess of American whaling industry made whale oil the               fuel of choice in this country. The best quality whale oil came               from the head of the <i>Balenus Mysticus</i>, the spermaceti whale.               Almost clear in color, spermaceti oil in Argand's lamp burned with               a bright flame. Its brightness was claimed to equal five to eight               candles. It also had an acceptable aroma - a significant difference               from that of other burning oils. These advantages were not without               drawbacks. Adding fuel to the reservoir seems always to have included               spillage. Also, the burner tubes of the early lamps and the tubular               wick riding between them were open at their lower extreme, so gravity               encouraged drips from the oil-soaked circular wick. This necessitated               the addition of glass drip cups suspended below the tubes. And these               cups needed, of course, to be washed frequently. There was also               the problem that the animal oil could become rancid.<br>            </p>            <p class="second"> Despite all of these problems elaborate and costly               lamps utilizing the Argand burner technology quickly became the               choice of the well-to-do in the first quarter of the 19th century.               By 1830, the number and variety of lamps employing Argand technology               reached well down the economic ladder. Expensive lamps continued               to be manufactured, but painted tin or japanned variations also               sold well. On the expensive end were the heavy mantel lamps popular               in the 1830s and 1840s, many of them weighing upwards of twenty               pounds. A growing variety of expensive, free-standing table lamps               was also introduced at this time. These new forms acquired a wonderfully               fanciful nomenclature. &quot; Solar&quot; lamps seemed to be as               bright as the sun and their name was derived from the Latin for               sun, <i>sol</i>. &quot;Astral&quot; was also a heavenly reference,               again from the Latin astra or stars. <i>Sinumbras</i> drew their               name from the Latin <i>sine umbra</i>, or without a shadow, since               their large diameter annular reservoirs allowed production of a               bright light with fewer attendant shadows than those cast by earlier               lamps. A good many evidences of the use of these lamps in American               homes survives in the form of drawings, paintings, and prints.</p>            <p class="second">Two of these paintings deserve special mention in               this context. <i>The Hobby Horse</i>, a painting from about 1840               by an unknown artist, features two delightful children with sinumbra               lamp on a small, round table in the rear of the room.

Darby, 1845,               an astral lamp is prominently displayed on the table in the center               of the family portrait.</p>            <p class="second">Such works of art also demonstrate how improved               artificial lighting affected room use and furniture placement. For               example, the appearance of sinumbra lamps in the 1810s and 1820s               is almost certainly related to the development of the placement               of tables in the centers of front parlors, replacing the 18th century               pattern of removing pieces of furniture not in use to the sides               of the room. Placed on a center table, the large sinumbra lamp provided               sufficient illumination so that several persons sitting around the               table could take advantage of the single light source. An 1852 lithograph               by Benjamin Robert Haydon, <i>Reading the Scriptures</i>, shows               a middle-aged gentleman seated at a table clearly in the center               of a room, reading from the Bible while a woman, presumably his               wife, listens intently from the other side of the table.</p>            <p class="second">Because the cost of lamps and fuel continued to               rise, daylight remained an important light source throughout the               19th century. This is also seen in 19th century works of art. For               example, John Harden's drawing <i>Members of the Harden Family Sewing               at Brathway Hall</i>, c1804, depicts family members seated at a               table near a window sewing. Even though the astral lamp is prominently               displayed on the table in the center of the previously mentioned               <i>The Reverend John Atwood and His Family</i>, the light in the               room clearly comes from the window. And, in George Scharf's drawing               entitled <i>Dearest Mother</i>, c1868, an older lady sits at a table               reading by the light issuing from a skylight despite the presence               of a lamp on a chest of drawers across the room from her. </p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td valign="bottom"><a href="sherma_23.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/sherma_2a.jpg" width="120" height="164" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>                <td valign="bottom">                  <center>                    <a href="sherma_23.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/sherma_3a.jpg" width="105" height="164" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                  </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td colspan="2">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="sherma_23.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2, 3:</b> Solar lamp.

One               reason for this was the rising cost of their fuel, whale oil. Therefore,               a lamp that retained the advantages of the central draft burner,               but could burn lard or other coarse fuels was needed. One solution               was the &quot;solar&quot; lamp whose burner was close to the wide,               almost flat top of the fuel reservoir. This allowed use of the heat               produced at the burner to liquefy the coarser fuel and impregnate               the wick. And, as kerosene was making its debut in the late 1850s,               the era of whale-oil fueled Argand technology lighting devices was               reaching an end. Kerosene as a fuel finally replaced the whale oil               needed for the complicated Argands with a simpler flat wick-in-a-cup               system and bellied glass chimney. But, the &quot;Rochester&quot;               kerosene burner re-introduced central draft technology using kerosene               for fuel in the 1880s.</p>            <table width="170" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                  <center>                    <a href="sherma_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/sherma_4a.jpg" width="100" height="178" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                  </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="sherma_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> Sinumbra or astral lamp (originally).

After 1860, many advertisements appeared in               magazines and newspapers suggesting that owners of older lighting               devices bring in their sinumbra, astral, solar and other such lamps               to local lamp merchants and repairmen so that the burner technology               could be converted for use with the newer and less expensive fuel.               Numbers of these &quot;updated&quot; lamps (along with other unaltered               examples) still exist in the collections of historic houses across               the country. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the Cornelius solar lamp               of 1843 from the collection of the Merchant's House Museum in New               York City which was retrofitted some time after 1860 with a flat               wick burner. Its lard oil reservoir was sealed at the base to create               a cup for kerosene and a hooded burner was attached. The lamp in               Figure 5, also from the Merchant's House collection, had its central               draft burner removed and the bulbous form above the Rococo Revival               standard was added to conceal the kerosene cup.<sup>1</sup><br>            </p>            <table width="170" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="sherma_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/sherma_5a.jpg" width="100" height="164" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                   </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="sherma_5.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     5:</b> &quot;Royal&quot; table lamp, late 1880s.
