In the 1780s, Fran&ccedil;ois-Pierre-Ami         Argand, a Swiss inventor and philosopher, developed and introduced an         improved lamp burner that revolutionized interior lighting. Argand, a         true child of the Enlightenment, associated with the leading scientific         figures of his day, including James Watt, Antoine de Lavoisier, the Montgolfier         brothers and Joseph Priestly. His glass chimneyed central draft burner         produced light equal to that of six to eight candles. It also improved         oxygenation at the burner, reduced consumption of oil, and practically         eliminated the need for snuffing (snipping away partially burned wicks         to reduce flickering).</p>      <p class="eighth">This improved technology immediately affected lighting         devices in the first half of the nineteenth century. In the second half         of the century, this new burner was used with both lighting and heating         devices. Its longer term benefits can still be observed in the circular         burners of contemporary gas cooking stoves. Argand's new burner led to         the development of new lamp forms and eventually affected both space usage         and furniture placement patterns. Interestingly, even those persons who         have understood the specifics of Argand's contribution to technology have         shown little concern for the influence that his center draft burner had         on improving the level of light in artificially illuminated interior domestic         spaces. </p>      <p class="eighth">Argand's name is generally unknown and recognition of         his contributions to interior lighting has largely been lost to history.         The Franco-phonic name of Ami Argand is almost totally unknown in France         where lamps with central draft technology are called Quinquets. They are         named after Antoine-Arnoult Quinquet, chemist and pharmacist from Soissons,         who used industrial espionage and trickery to deprive Argand of the fair         fruits of his invention in France. Even those familiar with the appellation         &quot;Argand burner&quot; have known little about the man. This situation         has recently been remedied with the 1999 publication of John J. Wolfe's         <i>Brandy, Balloons and Lamps: Ami Argand, 1750-1803</i>.<br>      </p>      <p class="eighth">Born in Geneva to a Swiss watchmaker and his wife on July         5, 1750, Argand was the ninth of ten children. He was well-educated. His         parents intended him for the clergy and enrolled him at the Auditoire         de Philsophie in Geneva. Instead, in 1775 Argand went to Paris for further         study in chemistry and physics, carrying introductions to Antoine Laurent         de Lavoisier. Lavoisier was a brilliant 18th century French scientist         and chemist whose seminal studies involving oxygen and combustion brought         a major change in scientific thinking about the role of oxygen in combustion.         After several years of study and lecturing, Argand accepted a post in         Paris as a teacher of chemistry. One of his interests concerned the distilling         of spirits. In the 1780, while working for a distiller in Languedoc, Argand         solved his need for better light during the night by developing the double-tube,         circular-wick, oil burning lamp with chimney which has come to bear his         name.</p>      <p class="eighth">Despite the availability of information regarding a wide         variety of scientific advances during the eighteenth century, no source         has been brought forward to suggest that Argand's central draft technology         is other than his own creation. In fact, until recently, no reliable reference         to Argand's life or his work existed. Wolfe's recent biography of Argand         finally redresses this deficiency. Wolfe has meticulously gathered information         which demonstrates that it was indeed Argand who first succeeded in creating         the burner technology which bears his name. Followers there were aplenty,         starting within months of his original patents, and Argand suffered greatly         from their scurrilous purloining of his techniques. Even Benjamin Franklin,         diplomat and inventor in late eighteenth-century America, came up with         a variation. But Franklin did not include the all important chimney. Franklin's         suggestion remained simply an idea and was not at all damaging to Argand         whose conception was truly a work of genius.</p>      <p class="eighth">What, exactly, was it that Argand accomplished? Illumination         prior to Argand's central draft burner relied on handmade candles and         a variety of open or partially open oil containers into which cotton or         rush wicks were inserted. The fuels were tallow, alcohol, and any available         oil, including fish, seal, whale and various vegetable oils. By the latter         part of the eighteenth century, some glass containers with either single         or double wicks inserted into drop-in burners were found in well-to-do         homes. Scientific experiment had demonstrated that two wicks burning side         by side delivered more than twice the illumination derived from two independent         light sources. This knowledge led to the design and use of the drop-in         burners with two side-by-side tubes set atop flint or blown glass containers.         Argand's innovative central draft burner improved greatly on the principle         of the paired wicks. Furthermore, its more complete combustion greatly         reduced the need for snuffing. But, lamps with these new burners were         very expensive and required a fine grade of oil which made them expensive         to maintain. Even with high initial costs and high maintenance, lamps         with central draft burners delivered high light levels, and this quality         made them popular with the middle and upper classes.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/sherma_1a.jpg" width="130" height="171" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 1:</b> The basic structure               of the Argand burner. Circa 1830, with straight glass chimney. Drawing               by the author.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">Argand made two essential improvements in central draft         burner technology. First, he mounted a cylindrical wick between two concentric         metal tubes. Openings at the base of these tubes allowed air to reach         the burner through the center of the inner tube as well as from the outside         of the outer tube. Second, Argand improved the draft of this well-oxygenated         air with addition of a tall straight chimney. His first chimneys were         made of pierced metal, but he soon substituted glass chimneys. Flint glass         was found to be preferable for the chimneys because it could withstand         the heat created at the circular burner without cracking. Argand's's own         preference was for blue glass chimneys, possibly because they reduced         the intensity of the light at the burner.</p>      <p class="eighth">Blue or clear, the chimneys are not simply decorative.         They force the heated gases produced at the burner to rise at an accelerated         rate, allowing fresh, oxygenated air to enter at the bottom center of         the inner tube. The resulting convection lifts away the carbonated gases         produced at the burning wick, enhancing the efficiency of the burner.         The chimney also steadies the flame and protects it from random drafts.         At the same time, the transparency of the glass allows the greatest dispersion         of the light produced at the burner. Argand is believed to have been the         first to employ a chimney in this way, but almost every subsequent oil-burning         lamp would utilize one. The resulting level of illumination was far brighter         than that from any lamp then known</p>      <p class="eighth">The oil used with these new burners had to be of a very         fine grade and were costly. The choice was between fine vegetable oil         - usually colza or rapeseed oil in Europe - and whale oil. The size and         prowess of American whaling industry made whale oil the fuel of choice         in this country. The best quality whale oil came from the head of the         <i>Balenus Mysticus</i>, the spermaceti whale. Almost clear in color,         spermaceti oil in Argand's lamp burned with a bright flame. Its brightness         was claimed to equal five to eight candles. It also had an acceptable         aroma - a significant difference from that of other burning oils. These         advantages were not without drawbacks. Adding fuel to the reservoir seems         always to have included spillage. Also, the burner tubes of the early         lamps and the tubular wick riding between them were open at their lower         extreme, so gravity encouraged drips from the oil-soaked circular wick.         This necessitated the addition of glass drip cups suspended below the         tubes. And these cups needed, of course, to be washed frequently. There         was also the problem that the animal oil could become rancid.<br>      </p>      <p class="eighth"> Despite all of these problems elaborate and costly lamps         utilizing the Argand burner technology quickly became the choice of the         well-to-do in the first quarter of the 19th century. By 1830, the number         and variety of lamps employing Argand technology reached well down the         economic ladder. Expensive lamps continued to be manufactured, but painted         tin or japanned variations also sold well. On the expensive end were the         heavy mantel lamps popular in the 1830s and 1840s, many of them weighing         upwards of twenty pounds. A growing variety of expensive, free-standing         table lamps was also introduced at this time. These new forms acquired         a wonderfully fanciful nomenclature. &quot; Solar&quot; lamps seemed to         be as bright as the sun and their name was derived from the Latin for         sun, <i>sol</i>. &quot;Astral&quot; was also a heavenly reference, again         from the Latin astra or stars. <i>Sinumbras</i> drew their name from the         Latin <i>sine umbra</i>, or without a shadow, since their large diameter         annular reservoirs allowed production of a bright light with fewer attendant         shadows than those cast by earlier lamps. A good many evidences of the         use of these lamps in American homes survives in the form of drawings,         paintings, and prints.</p>      <p class="eighth">Two of these paintings deserve special mention in this         context. <i>The Hobby Horse</i>, a painting from about 1840 by an unknown         artist, features two delightful children with sinumbra lamp on a small,         round table in the rear of the room. In <i>The Reverend John Atwood and         His Family</i> by Henry F. Darby, 1845, an astral lamp is prominently         displayed on the table in the center of the family portrait.</p>      <p class="eighth">Such works of art also demonstrate how improved artificial         lighting affected room use and furniture placement. For example, the appearance         of sinumbra lamps in the 1810s and 1820s is almost certainly related to         the development of the placement of tables in the centers of front parlors,         replacing the 18th century pattern of removing pieces of furniture not         in use to the sides of the room. Placed on a center table, the large sinumbra         lamp provided sufficient illumination so that several persons sitting         around the table could take advantage of the single light source. An 1852         lithograph by Benjamin Robert Haydon, <i>Reading the Scriptures</i>, shows         a middle-aged gentleman seated at a table clearly in the center of a room,         reading from the Bible while a woman, presumably his wife, listens intently         from the other side of the table.</p>      <p class="eighth">Because the cost of lamps and fuel continued to rise,         daylight remained an important light source throughout the 19th century.         This is also seen in 19th century works of art. For example, John Harden's         drawing <i>Members of the Harden Family Sewing at Brathway Hall</i>, c1804,         depicts family members seated at a table near a window sewing. Even though         the astral lamp is prominently displayed on the table in the center of         the previously mentioned <i>The Reverend John Atwood and His Family</i>,         the light in the room clearly comes from the window. And, in George Scharf's         drawing entitled <i>Dearest Mother</i>, c1868, an older lady sits at a         table reading by the light issuing from a skylight despite the presence         of a lamp on a chest of drawers across the room from her. </p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td valign="bottom"><img src="gr/sherma_2a.jpg" width="120" height="164" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>          <td valign="bottom"> <img src="gr/sherma_3a.jpg" width="105" height="164" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">           </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td colspan="2">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2, 3:</b> Solar lamp.

One reason for this         was the rising cost of their fuel, whale oil. Therefore, a lamp that retained         the advantages of the central draft burner, but could burn lard or other         coarse fuels was needed. One solution was the &quot;solar&quot; lamp whose         burner was close to the wide, almost flat top of the fuel reservoir. This         allowed use of the heat produced at the burner to liquefy the coarser         fuel and impregnate the wick. And, as kerosene was making its debut in         the late 1850s, the era of whale-oil fueled Argand technology lighting         devices was reaching an end. Kerosene as a fuel finally replaced the whale         oil needed for the complicated Argands with a simpler flat wick-in-a-cup         system and bellied glass chimney. But, the &quot;Rochester&quot; kerosene         burner re-introduced central draft technology using kerosene for fuel         in the 1880s.</p>      <table width="170" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/sherma_4a.jpg" width="100" height="178" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4:</b> Sinumbra or astral               lamp (originally).

Numbers of these &quot;updated&quot; lamps (along with         other unaltered examples) still exist in the collections of historic houses         across the country. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the Cornelius solar lamp         of 1843 from the collection of the Merchant's House Museum in New York         City which was retrofitted some time after 1860 with a flat wick burner.         Its lard oil reservoir was sealed at the base to create a cup for kerosene         and a hooded burner was attached. The lamp in Figure 5, also from the         Merchant's House collection, had its central draft burner removed and         the bulbous form above the Rococo Revival standard was added to conceal         the kerosene cup.<sup>1</sup><br>      </p>      <table width="170" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/sherma_5a.jpg" width="100" height="164" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 5:</b> &quot;Royal&quot;               table lamp, late 1880s.

While gas lighting was         used early in large interior spaces, the more intimate spaces of domestic         interiors benefitted dramatically from the creation and evolution of central         draft lamps.
