With the design 		of the Dymaxion House, he reconfigured the house it into a radial plan 		with a metal and plastic exterior. Therefore, although Fuller's attitude 		toward mass-production and prefabrication paralleled the interests of 		International Style architects, his unusual design concepts have prompted 		most historians to categorize them as fantasy or futuristic architecture.<sup>7</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Even though Fuller was not a trained architect,<sup>8</sup>         he did intend that his designs serve as practical solutions to housing         problems, not as imaginative exercises. As explained earlier, he was disdainful         of most architects because he felt that their approach to housing was         inhibited by their fidelity &quot;to the demands of style or tradition.&quot;         In terms of housing, the only traditions to which Fuller conformed were         those of providing shelter and comfort. He further believed that houses         should enrich the lives of their inhabitants. These guidelines motivated         Fuller to conceptualize the house as a demountable, radial container designed         to facilitate everyday life.<sup>9</sup> His designs were intended to         offer a feasible way to apply the principles of industrial production         to housing even though they were not bound by the stylistic conventions         of architecture nor its history.</p>      <p class="eighth">Fuller claimed he discovered how resistant &quot;exterior         decorators&quot; could be to his ideas in May 1928 when he presented the         4D House to the AIA at its 61st convention in St. Louis.<sup>10</sup>         Fuller was promoting the house as the answer to the need for affordable         housing and offered it as a complimentary gift to the association. This         was a generous but naive gesture since its design was amateurish and awkward.         The timing was also very bad because Milton Medary, the AIA president,         opened the convention with an address criticizing &quot;a growing tendency         to standardize architectural design.&quot;<sup>11</sup> In addition, the         AIA board of directors released a report stating: &quot;It is quite possible         that certain functions of the architect may well become standardized,         but what of the art of design? Can one seriously consider the standardization         of the drama, of literature, of music, or arts kindred to our own such         as painting and sculpture? There is even now becoming evident in our work         from coast to coast[...]a universal product made to sell.&quot;<sup>12</sup>         Unfortunately for Fuller, his 4D House was a design for a mass-produced,         prefabricated home &quot;made to sell,&quot; precisely the type of structure         the AIA was strongly criticizing and publicly opposing. Even if the 4D         House had been a well-conceived design, given the opening statements of         its president, the AIA could not have accepted it. Fuller was disappointed         by the AIA's response but was not deterred from his goal of using industry         and technology to produce housing.</p>      <p class="eighth">After the AIA convention, Fuller began a personal crusade         to accomplish this goal. He immediately self-published his manifesto,         <i>4D Time Lock</i>, 1928,<sup>13</sup> contacted the press and began         to draw upon his network of business contacts, friends, and supporters         to help promote his project.<sup>14</sup> He redesigned the house and         prepared to take his idea directly to the public. During the preparations         for this launch the name of the house was changed from '4D' to 'Dymaxion'.<sup>15</sup>         A little less than one year after the convention, the redesigned and renamed         house was given its public debut in April 1929 at the Marshall Field and         Company department store in Chicago.<sup>16</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">There were few similarities between the designs of the         two houses. Both were to be industrially manufactured and assembled from         standardized components. In contrast to the fenestrated walls of the 4D         House, the walls of the Dymaxion House were transparent plastic, fig.         1. Whereas 4D was a rectangular, two-story, central mast house only slightly         raised above the ground, the Marshall Field model of the Dymaxion House         was a hexagonal, one-story, central mast structure suspended a full-floor         above ground level and stabilized with steel cables. The central mast,         which was celebrated in the Dymaxion House but seemed like an afterthought         in the 4D House, served as a utility core in both. Numerous household         appliances and mechanical systems were incorporated into each to make         housework less strenuous.<sup>17</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">These innovations were also incorporated into the second         model of the Dymaxion House which was made between sometime between May         1929 and March 1930.<sup>18</sup> Unlike the first rickety, paper model,         the sturdy new version was constructed of shiny aluminum and transparent         plastic; if manufactured the house was to be made of inflatable duraluminum         and casein, fig. 2. It was also sleeker than the first model with a narrower         living space supporting a roof deck and covering a parking area.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/loranc_2a.jpg" width="141" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b><font color="#000000">Fig 2:</font></b><font color="#000000">               Photograph of the second model of the Dymaxion House, no date, approx.               5&quot; x 7&quot;; Courtesy, The Estate of Buckminster Fuller, Sebastopol,               CA and Courtesy of Department of Special Collections, Stanford Universities               Libraries, Stanford, CA.</font></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">Since it was of metal and looked machine-made, the new         model better illustrated Fuller's principles of mass-production, prefabrication         and industrial processes.<sup>19</sup> He felt that metal was the modern         tool.<sup>20</sup> He also believed that metal should determine the processes         of production and the approach to design. Therefore, a house should be         designed to have as many elements as possible made of metal, shaped by         a machine, prefabricated and mass-produced. In other words, a house should         be designed and produced like a car out of factory-made parts. With the         1929 version of the Dymaxion House Fuller had realized a more appropriate         prototype for the adaptation of industrial methods of production to housing.</p>      <p class="eighth">Fuller, as previously stated, shared this interest with         many of his contemporaries although he disapproved of their use of mass-production,         prefabrication and industrial processes. He was particularly critical         towards the work of Gropius, Mies, Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. Although         each had made important contributions to housing by the late 1920s, Fuller         thought they failed to set new standards for both its design and production.         He believed that they, like most architects, relied upon the machine to         replicate or replace handwork; that they did not permit the machine to         control the construction process. Fuller thought they designed with clean,         simple forms which accommodated machine movement or appeared to be machine-made         and this was merely changing the appearance of a building, not changing         how it was made. He also felt they designed with some prefabricated and         standardized parts which were incorporated into the finished structure,         again affecting composition more than method.<sup>21</sup> To Fuller,         such techniques added elements of industrialization to the craft-labor         construction process but were technologically conservative and did not         significantly alter it. In Fuller's mind, Wright, Gropius, Mies and Corbusier         were transferring the hand-production based Arts and Crafts aesthetic         of the 19th century to machine production in the 20th. Their understanding         of architecture was based on education and on-the-job training unlike         Fuller who learned what he described as &quot;craft building&quot;<sup>22</sup>         as President of the Stockade Building System. This was a patented system         of construction using fibrous building blocks. Fuller formed the company         with his father-in-law, James Monroe Hewlett and was its president from         1922 to 1927.<sup>23</sup> In addition, Fuller knew and read many important         architectural texts of the time. His practical experience was more limited         than that of the architects he criticized, but, in combination with his         knowledge of contemporary writing, it fueled his ambition to apply industrial         methods to the housing industry.<br>      </p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/loranc_3a.jpg" width="129" height="185" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b><font color="#000000">Fig 3:</font></b><font color="#000000">               Page 3 of unpublished reference list for <i>4D TimeLock</i>, 1928.               Fuller has numbered this both E-300 and 94.

Yet, the unpublished reference list for <i>4D         Time Lock</i> is a lengthy roster of important writings, fig. 3. There         are no references to Mies and Gropius, but, the 1927 English edition of         Corbusier's <i>Towards a New Architecture</i> and Wright's essay &quot;What         &quot;Styles&quot; Mean to the Architect,&quot; <i>Architectural Record</i>,         February 1928, are included.<sup>24</sup> Given Fuller's insistence that         Wright was privileging style over process, it is surprising that Fuller         does not list Wright's essay &quot;Art and Craft of the Machine,&quot;         1901. In this essay Wright argued that the machine be used to free the         artist from the drudgery of handwork. He thought it was fine to use the         machine to produce the components of a building but the design and appearance         should still be determined by the architect's aesthetic sensibilities.<sup>25</sup>         Wright reinforced this argument in &quot;What &quot;Styles&quot; Mean         to the Architect&quot; by claiming standardization serves as the impersonal         structure with which the architect's personal style should be integrated.         He wrote: &quot;standardization[...]serves as a kind of warp on which         to weave the woof of[...]building.&quot;<sup>26</sup> In contrast, Fuller         proposed that standardization should serve as the basis for both the structure         and design of a building. Although there are similarities in their approaches,         Wright and Fuller differed in their assessments of the role industrial         methods should play in architecture. Fuller's inclusion of &quot;What         &quot;Styles&quot; Mean to the Architect&quot; in his reference list may         have been to demonstrate that his own theory of design was related to,         but different from, the philosophy of one of architecture's leaders.</p>      <p class="eighth"> This may also have been Fuller's motivation for including         Corbusier's <i>Towards a New Architecture</i> on the reference list. Unlike         &quot;What &quot;Styles&quot; Mean to the Architect,&quot; Fuller provides         an evaluation of this source in a letter he wrote to his sister Rosamond         on August 11, 1928. In it he claimed that he and Corbusier have almost         &quot;identical phraseology.&quot; He wrote that Corbusier was:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth">&quot;the great revolutionist in architectural design           whose book should be read in conjunction with my 4D. My own reading           of Corbusier's &quot;Towards a New Architecture&quot;, at the time when           I was writing my own, nearly stunned me by the almost identical phraseology           of his telegraphic style of notion with the notations of my own set           down completely from my own intuitive searching and reasoning and unaware           even of the existence of such a man as Corbusier. Corusier [sic] was           first called to my attention by Russell Walcott, the best of residential           designers in Chicago, when I was explaining my principles to him last           November.&quot;<sup>27</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">Walcott may have told Fuller about Corbusier in November         1927, but, he lent Fuller <i>Towards A New Architecture</i> the following         January. Fuller dutifully noted the act in his diary on January 30, 1928:         &quot;Called on Russell Walcott and borrowed Le Corbusier's &quot;Towards         the New Architecture&quot;[...]RBF read Le Corbusier until very late at         night. Startled at coincidence of results arrived at in comparison to         Fuller Houses but misses main philosophy of home as against house.&quot;<sup>28</sup>         Although Fuller was criticizing Corbusier for being interested more in         the formal properties of a house than in accommodating the activities         that make it a home, he empathized with Corbusier's philosophy.<sup>29</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Whether resulting from &quot;identical phraseology&quot; 		or direct influence, there are numerous similarities between the ideas 		presented in <i>4D Time Lock</i> and <i>Towards A New Architecture</i>.<sup>30</sup> 		Each book called for the use of standardization, prefabrication and mass-production 		in the building industry. Furthermore, both referred to the automobile 		industry as a prototype. Fuller often used the analogy of automobile production 		to support his argument that houses should be mass-produced and not custom-designed. 		According to him, the cost per automobile decreases as more cars are manufactured 		which allows the manufacturer to price products according to make and 		model. He wanted to apply this method to housing. Corbusier, on the other 		hand, included the idea as almost an offhand comment and without elaboration 		or instructions. He simply wrote: &quot;I am 40 years old, why should 		I not buy a house for myself? for I need this instrument; a house built 		on the same principles as the Ford car I bought (or my Citroen, if I am 		particular).&quot;<sup>31</sup> Corbusier's comment is so subtle that 		it is difficult to link it to Fuller's developed argument. Fuller, however, 		found an corresponding idea in Corbusier's short recommendation.</p>      <p class="eighth">Corbusier also briefly alluded to another one of Fuller's         major points: the need to reduce the weight of buildings. Fuller recommended         that the weight of buildings be decreased in order to lower costs and         waste. He repeatedly argues this throughout 4D Time Lock and devotes an         entire chapter to the subject, <i>Chapter Nine: Weight in Building as         the New Economical Factor</i>. Corbusier, in the caption for <i>Le Corbusier,         1919</i>, <i>A &quot;Monol&quot; House</i> succinctly states that &quot;the         ordinary house weighs too much&quot;.<sup>32</sup> The similarity in their         thinking is clearer in this case although the degree to which they dealt         with the subject is again different.</p>      <p class="eighth">They both believed machines would increasingly be used         in the home to make housework easier, but, they disagreed about who would         reap the benefits. Fuller included mechanical appliances to ease the drudgery         of housekeeping and supply the housewife with dutiful and competent mechanical         servants. He thought mechanical appliances would replace servants. Corbusier         thought machines would make it possible for servants to work in shifts,         like factory workers. He wrote: &quot;Modern achievement[...]replaces         human labour by the machine and by good organization[...]Servants are         no longer of necessity tied to the house: they come here, as they would         a factory, and do their eight hours; in this way an active staff is available         day and night.&quot;<sup>33</sup> In terms of mechanical appliances, Fuller         and Corbusier are proposing dissimilar applications for similar technology.</p>      <p class="eighth">Not surprisingly, they also meant different things when         they proclaimed the need for a new architecture to meet the needs of modern         life. Corbusier wanted to make a &quot;machine for living in&quot; by         using machine processes to achieve aesthetic results that would please         the inhabitant. Fuller wanted a &quot;machine for living,&quot; a house         that would function like a machine to improve the quality of the life         of its inhabitants.<sup>34</sup> Corbusier wanted to use machine made         parts like puzzle pieces to create a whole whereas Fuller wanted the machine         to serve as a model of efficiency. Corbusier wanted modern architecture         to serve as a stage for modern life; Fuller wanted modern architecture         to facilitate modern life.</p>      <p class="eighth">Fuller and Corbusier were working with related ideas in         their programs for the modern house. But, as the previous comparisons         have shown, they varied in their application and expression of these ideas.         These programs, therefore, led to different possibilities for architecture         as Reyner Banham explained in <i>Theory and Design in the First Machine         Age</i>. He wrote:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth">&quot;Fuller had advanced, in his Dymaxion House project,           a concept of domestic design that[...]had it been built, would have           rendered [Corbusier's designs...] technically obsolete before design           had even begun[...]The formal qualities of [the Dymaxion House] are           not remarkable, except in combination with the structural and planning           methods involved. The structure does not derive from the imposition           of a[n...] aesthetic on a material that has been elevated to the level           of a symbol for 'the machine'[...]The planning derives from a liberated           attitude to those mechanical services that had precipated the whole           Modern adventure by their invasion of homes and streets before 1914.&quot;<sup>35</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">Banham saw in the Dymaxion House potential for a new type         of architecture and in Corbusier's housing designs he found the updating         of existing architectural conventions. Despite their differences there         are still similarities found in their 1920s projects which demonstrate         how easily Fuller could be &quot;[s]tartled at coincidence of results         arrived at in comparison to Fuller Houses&quot; in Corbusier's book.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/loranc_4a.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b><font color="#000000">Fig 4:</font></b><font color="#000000">               Le Corbusier, Villa Savoye, Poissy, France, 1928-29.

Both houses have horizontal strip         windows but Corbusier treats them like traditional fenestration which         is set into the wall unlike Fuller who treats them as major components         of the wall. Because there is a structural frame in each house the walls         are not load-bearing and the facades free. The roof of each is utilized:         Corbusier transformed it into a roof garden and Fuller converted it into         an upper deck. The houses do, however, differ in their plans. Corbusier         used an orthogonal footprint with rectangular rooms that connect to one         another; Fuller used a radial plan with triangular rooms that are accessed         either at the central mast or along the outer wall. Thus, although the         configuration of the homes are not alike, many components are treated         similarly.</p>      <p class="eighth">Whether this resulted from coincidence or influence is 		difficult to determine. With the exception of the central mast, Fuller 		completely reconfigured his design between its May 1928 presentation to 		the AIA and the April 1929 exhibition at Marshall Field. Furthermore, 		it was also drastically redesigned during the production of the second 		model before March 1930. According to his diary, Fuller read <i>Towards 		A New Architecture</i> in January 1928 before any of the designs were 		formulated. The 1929 version more clearly reflected Fuller's ideological 		program for the house: that it should be prefabricated and mass-produced 		as well as facilitate the lives of the inhabitants.<sup>37</sup> The new model may 		also have been intended to illustrate that Fuller knew of contemporary 		developments in housing design and that he was correcting what he considered 		to be their shortcomings. Therefore, by designing a house that drew upon 		current debates (role of the machine, standardization and mass-production 		in housing) and also drew upon concurrent aesthetics (raising the living 		areas above the ground, recreational use of the roof and window walls), 		Fuller was demonstrating his understanding of and desire to improve contemporary 		design and architectural theory.</p>      <p class="eighth">There are two other characteristics of the Dymaxion House         which can serve as concluding points of difference and similarity between         Fuller's house and the designs of his colleagues. These are mobility and         assembly. The Dymaxion House was designed to be mobile in the sense that         it could be taken apart, shipped to a new location and reassembled. Fuller         believed mobility represented a number of ideals including time as the         new currency, industrial production, reduced weight and the American spirit         of individualism and freedom. Although Fuller considered mobility to be         an important consideration of modern housing, he did not design the house         to be transported as a unit. In a process which would have been both inconvenient         and time-consuming, the house was designed to be taken apart, crated,         shipped to the new location and re-assembled.</p>      <p class="eighth">The method of moving the house was the same as that specified 		for its delivery from the factory to its original location. The components 		of the Dymaxion House were designed to be mass-produced and prefabricated 		in a factory. Then, they were to be crated, shipped to the site and assembled 		by hand. This is a strange paradox since Fuller insisted upon machine 		production and allowing industrial processes to determine the design strategy, 		but, he maintained the traditional reliance upon craft labor to assemble 		the various components of the house into a finished building. It is also 		in contrast to his argument that &quot;craft building[...]is an art which 		belongs in the middle ages.&quot;<sup>38</sup> Fuller, however, believed 		he needed to use craft labor on site because he thought shipping the assembled 		house was impractical. He wrote:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth">&quot;Of importance[...]was the problem of transporting 		  large units of structure[...]entire houses and apartment houses must 		  be constructed in factories and delivered as totally assembled products, 		  like automobiles. But with existing transportation facilities, no house 		  can be moved more than a few miles. It is not practicable [sic] to load 		  a house on a flatcar or a trailer and transport it through city streets, 		  under and over bridges, and through tunnels. It is theoretically possible, 		  to deliver a full-size, pre-assembled house by air.&quot;<sup>39</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">Although Fuller's decision to ship the house as a kit 		was based on practical considerations, it was also similar to the role 		that Mies van der Rohe thought mass-production and prefabrication would 		play in the housing industry. In 1924 Mies predicted that &quot;industrial 		production of all the parts can really be rationalized only in the course 		of the manufacturing process, and work on the site will be entirely a 		matter of assembly.&quot;<sup>40</sup> It is doubtful Fuller would have 		known of Mies' prediction since it was published in the German magazine 		G.<sup>41</sup> While Fuller and Mies were considering the issues of construction 		from two different vantage points, their conclusions are remarkably similar. 		This may have resulted from their common knowledge of architectural theory 		or it may have been another instance of &quot;startling coincidences of 		results.&quot;</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/loranc_5a.jpg" width="169" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b><font color="#000000">Fig 5:</font></b><font color="#000000">               Anne Hewlett Fuller, <i>Untitled Painting of Dymaxion House and               Dymaxion Car</i>, no date, approx. 24&quot; x 36&quot;; Courtesy,               The Estate of Buckminster Fuller, Sebastopol, CA and Courtesy of               Department of Special Collections, Stanford Universities Libraries,               Stanford, CA.</font></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">Despite the &quot;startling coincidences of results,&quot; 		Fuller believed Mies and other architects of the 1920s did not fully explore 		the potentials of the machine and industrial production in their housing 		designs. Buckminster Fuller believed the only way to design houses was 		to do so according to industrial methods of production and machine processes. 		In addition, he espoused that materials appropriate for industrial production, 		especially metal and plastic, were to be used. He established these criteria 		between 1928 and 1929 in the development of his first project for a mass-produced 		house, the 4D/Dymaxion House. These criteria were the foundation upon 		which Fuller built his design strategy for housing. This was a strategy 		based upon production, not aesthetics. As he wrote in <i>4D Time Lock</i>, 		&quot;nostalgia for past values and aesthetics are not allowed to interfere 		with the industrially produced house.&quot;<sup>42</sup> Fuller was proclaiming 		that new methods of production would produce a new type of modern housing 		with its own system of aesthetics, reflecting its time and methods of 		production without being tethered to those of the past.</p>                  <p class="eighth"><b>Notes</b></p>      <p class="eighth">1.

This         aspect of the geodesic dome is often overlooked since it is usually employed         for industrial or commercial applications. Fuller considered the geodesic         dome to be an environmental valve that could &quot;envelop living quarters,         gardens, lawns, acres or cities&quot; and could cause &quot;the conventional         house to become, if not obsolete, at least increasingly superfluous.&quot;         (<i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p. 65)</p>      <p class="eighth">5.

He endured rejection at the hands         of the American Institute of Architects early in his career, only to be         celebrated in the inaugural issue of <i>Perspecta</i> in 1952 as one of         three &quot;new directions&quot; in architecture, along with Philip Johnson         and Paul Rudolph. Whereupon Johnson in turn acknowledged a certain respect         for Fuller even as he dismissed him as a delirious technician in &quot;The         Seven Crutches of Modern Architecture,&quot; published two years later         in the same journal.&quot; (<i>ANY</i>, No. 17, 1997, p. 15)</p>      <p class="eighth">6.

For typical treatments of Fuller's work see Kenneth         Frampton, <i>Modern Architecture: A Critical History</i>, 3rd ed., 1992,         which discusses Fuller's work as an alternative to modernist architecture;         William J.R. Curtis, <i>Modern Architecture Since 1900</i>, 3rd ed., 1996;         and Reyner Banham, <i>Theory and Design in the First Machine Age</i>,         1960, which praises Fuller's use of technology. Fuller's designs, especially         the Dymaxion House and the Wichita House, are usually treated as prototypes         for futuristic housing as in <i>Yesterday's Houses of Tomorrow: Innovative         American Homes 1850 to 1950</i>, H. Ward Jandl and others, 1991.</p>      <p class="eighth">8. Fuller had no professional training in any field and         described himself as an anticipatory comprehensive designer which means         he was a generalist trying to use present technology to anticipate future         needs. (<i>BuckyWorks</i>, pp. 62-65) He did receive &quot;limited formal         education&quot; at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, where he spent         &quot;a few months&quot; in 1917. (<i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster         Fuller</i>, p. 13, and <i>BuckyWorks</i>, p.4)</p>      <p class="eighth">9. Fuller used mathematics to justify his radial or circular         design: the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. A         circular configuration is preferred because in a circle there is a consistent         distance, the diameter, from the center to all points on the perimeter.         In a house with a radial plan all parts would be quickly and easily accessed         from the center. Therefore, this configuration would help its inhabitants         save time which he believed was the most important commodity of modern         living. Fuller believed time was replacing gold as the economic standard:         &quot;Without legislation recognizing it, the world is now on a time standard         instead of a gold standard in temporal things. Wasting time is exactly         the same as throwing away gold used to be. Therefore, we are forced to         design and figure in the fourth dimension which is time.&quot; (R. Buckminster         Fuller, <i>4D Time Lock</i>, Chicago: The Author, 1928, p. 10) There is         second explanation on page 15 and a third on page 16.</p>      <p class="eighth">10. No documentation has been found to date to verify         that Fuller actually made the presentation at the 1928 AIA convention.         Drafts of two texts that appear to be the speech he could have given to         the AIA and a rejoinder he wrote upon his return are in Volume 33 of the         <i>Chronofile</i>. As far as appreciating Fuller's contributions to architecture,         architects, historians and critics differ widely in their evaluation of         Fuller's significance. The misunderstanding of his intentions still evokes         dismissal of his work. For example, in what the publishers describe as         a &quot;pioneering critical survey of the most significant European and         North American statements of architectural theory,&quot; Hanno-Walter         Kruft writes: &quot;With...Fuller...we find all conventional concepts         of architecture scattered to the winds. Fuller saw architecture as applied         technology &#151; an arrangement of universal laws expressed in terms         of energy, mathematics, rationality...Fuller's lightweight constructions         serve a function as large temporary buildings for exhibitions and similar         purposes but they cannot be considered as architecture, nor should the         principles behind them be considered as relevant to architecture.&quot;         (<i>A History of Architectural Theory from Vitruvius to the Present</i>,         New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1994, pp. 438-9). Curiously,         Kruft seems to have included Fuller simply to discredit him. If the two         references to Fuller listed in the bibliography and footnotes are his         primary sources of information, it is easy to understand Kruft's misreading         of him.</p>      <p class="eighth">11. <i>Cities Becoming 'Peas of One Pod,'</i> p. 5.</p>      <p class="eighth">12. Ibid., p. 5.</p>      <p class="eighth">13. Fuller sent <i>4D Time Lock</i> to an impressive list         of prominent people including Henry Ford, Bruce Barton, Ralph T. Walker,         Christopher Morley, and the presidents of Harvard University, M.I.T. and         the University of Chicago. A complete list, with replies, is given on         pages 38-54 in the 1972 edition of the book.</p>      <p class="eighth">14. The <i>Chronofile</i> documents the extensive network         of acquaintances in the architectural and building professions Fuller         developed as President of Stockade Building System. Stockade was acquired         by the Celotex Company in 1927 after Hewlett sold his shares and Fuller         was forced out. (<i>Chronofile</i>, Vols. 27-32, 1923-1927)</p>      <p class="eighth">15'Dymaxion' is a combination of 'dynamism,' 'maximum,'         and 'ion.' Fuller claimed that the word 'dymaxion' was the result of a         collaborative effort between himself and Waldo Warren, an advertising         specialist. To date, no confirmation or contradiction has been found in         either Fuller's or Marshall Field's archives. For an account of the process         through which 'Dymaxion' was developed see <i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster         Fuller</i>, p. 21.</p>      <p class="eighth">16. Marshall Field asked Fuller to display the model in 		the Interior Design galleries because the store was promoting furniture 		recently purchased in Europe. Fuller claimed that the store's intention 		was to make the 'advanced design' of the furniture appear conservative 		in relation to the design of the house. (<i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster 		Fuller</i>, p. 21) There is a two-minute clip in the movie <i>Buckminster 		Fuller: Thinking Out Loud</i> (Simon &amp; Goodman, 1997) that shows Fuller 		presenting the model. In the movie, Antonio Salemme, a sculptor, explains 		that Fuller made the model in six months while staying in Salemme's Greenwich 		Village studio and then presented it to the Architectural League. Salemme 		must be talking about the second model for the Dymaxion House even though 		the clip shows the model displayed at Marshall Field. Fuller was living 		in Chicago when the first model was made and did not move to New York 		until after April 1929. (<i>Chronofile</i>, Vols. 35-36, 1928-1929)</p>	  <p class="eighth">17. These included a electric stove, dishwasher, 3-minute         laundry unit, and a central ventilating system that removed dust from         the air and maintained an optimal temperature. For a more complete inventory         see Joseph Corn and Brian Horrigan, <i>Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions         of the American Future</i>, Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press,         1984, pp. 67-69.</p>      <p class="eighth">18. This calculation is based on the fact that the first         model was exhibited at the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art from May         20-25, 1929, and the second model was exhibited in the same gallery from         March 12-14, 1930. (<i>Chronofile</i>, Vol. 35, 1929 and Vol. 37, 1930)</p>      <p class="eighth">19. This second model is the one that is most well-known         and its metallic, spaceship-like appearance is one aspect that contributed         to its being classified as fantastic or futuristic. Although the use of         aluminum for the frame (such as the 1931 Aluminaire House by A.L Kocher         and A. Frey) or for the cladding of a building (most notably Otto Wagner's         Die Zeit, 1902) was explored, the convention of an orthogonal footprint         was maintained unlike Fuller's hexagonal living area suspended above the         ground from the central mast. In addition, there are a number architects         who have investigated the possibilities of a central mast building throughout         the twentieth century including Frank Lloyd Wright (St. Marks Tower Project,         1929, and Johnson Wax Research Tower, Racine, WI, 1949), George Keck (House         of Tomorrow, Michigan City, IN, 1933), Richard Neutra and Peter Pfisterer         (Diatom-One-Plus-Two House Project, 1926). A second factor strongly contributing         to the relegation of the Dymaxion House to the realm of futuristic housing         was the inclusion of the numerous appliances and mechanical systems. This         was not as fantastic as critics and historians claim. Although some of         the appliances Fuller specified, especially the 3-minute laundry unit,         were too complicated for production in the late 1920s, the majority of         the appliances and systems Fuller included were available. (See my article         <i>Promises, Promises: Household Appliances in the 1920s, Part 3: Architecture</i>,         June 1998)</p>      <p class="eighth">20. According to Fuller: &quot;The new tool of this age         is metal from which has been born mechanics or directed mechanical motion,         which is governed fourth dimensional design. It is metal that has made         possible the automobile, the railroad, the airplane, telephone, wireless,         the clothes on our back and all our food, our city skyscraper. Generally,         and structurally speaking, we use it in our houses in the form of nails         only. Structurally the characteristic of the new tool, metal, different         from any of the tools of other ages, is its fibre or tensile strength,         tremendously in excess of any other tensile unit ever created.&quot; (<i>4D         Time Lock</i>, p. 4, italics in the original)</p>      <p class="eighth">21. This is somewhat ironic because, except for the geodesic         dome, Fuller intended that his houses be taken apart, crated and shipped         to the site for assembly by hand when relocated. Ideally, the geodesic         dome would be flown to its new site. See note 39 below.</p>      <p class="eighth">22. <i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p.         13.</p>      <p class="eighth">23. Fuller claimed that his understanding of architecture         and building was learned from practical experience only and primarily         during his years at Stockade: &quot;That is when I really learned the         building business...And the experience made me realize that craft building         &#151; in which each house is a pilot model for a design which never has         any runs &#151; is an art which belongs in the middle ages.&quot; (<i>The         Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p. 13)</p>      <p class="eighth">24. Fuller's knowledge of 1920s architecture and architectural         theory was much more greater than he admitted. In Vol. 34 of the Chronofile         is a five-page reference list for 4D Time Lock. Although it cannot be         known how many of these items Fuller actually read, the fact that he included         them indicates his familiarity with the architectural currents of the         1920s. These two are items number 4 and 56 on his reference list. (<i>Chronofile</i>,         Vol. 34, 1928)</p>      <p class="eighth">25. Wright first presented &quot;The Art and Craft of         the Machine&quot; as a lecture in 1901. He reworked it into an essay.         In <i>The Cause of Architecture</i> consisted of two separate series published         in <i>Architectural Record</i> during 1927 and 1928, respectively. Wright         continued the argument of The Art and Craft of the Machine in the 1927         series in which he discussed the pros and cons of the use of the machine,         or, as he described it, &quot;the architect's tool.&quot; In the 1928         series, Wright was more concerned with design. In both he argued against         allowing standardization to destroy the art of building.</p>      <p class="eighth">26.

This idea         is expressed in Wright's textile block houses from the first half of the         1920s, as seen in the 1923 house, La Miniatura, he designed for Alice         Millard. Wright used pre-fabricated and mass-produced components but in         a traditional manner: different elements were brought together to produce         a unified and aesthetic building.</p>      <p class="eighth">27. <i>4D Time Lock</i>, p. 79. It is not clear to what         Fuller is referring when he describes Corbusier's &quot;telegraphic style         of notion.&quot; It may be that he thought Corbusier was clear and concise.</p>      <p class="eighth">28. <i>Chronofile</i>, Vol. 30, 1927-28. Fuller Houses         was the original name of the 4D/Dymaxion House project. Fuller reused         &quot;Fuller Houses&quot; for the company he created in 1945 to manufacture         his post-World War II housing design.</p>      <p class="eighth">29. There is no documentation in the <i>Chronofile</i>         for the beginning of the Fuller Houses project. It is first mentioned         on November 22, 1927 in the diary by Fuller's wife, Anne, who noted that         Fuller talked about 'Fuller Houses' with a salesman from Stockade. (Vol.         30, 1927-28) Therefore, how much influence <i>Towards a New Architecture</i>         might have exerted on Fuller is unknown</p>      <p class="eighth">30. Only the most significant similarities will be discussed         in this essay. For Le Corbusier, the page numbers in the following notes         are from: <i>Towards A New Architecture</i>, New York: Dover Publications,         1986.</p>      <p class="eighth">31. Fuller claimed that &quot;The new Ford cost approximately         $43,000,000 for its first single unit, but on a basis of an infinity of         reproductions, each of the latter cost but $500...Price varies with models         and sizes.&quot; Therefore, Fuller believed, mass-production would serve         to lower the cost of housing in the same manner: &quot;It was inevitable...that         a complete house with every requirement, industrially to be fashioned,         should eventually be evolved...Tho [sic] it cost 100 million if but one         unit were constructed, the machinery, thereto attendant, and distribution         system having been set up, replicas may be had for close to the material         cost, or on a weight basis as all shipping or machinery is sold.&quot;         (Buckminster Fuller, &quot;Tree-Like Style of Dwelling Is Planned,&quot;         <i>The Chicago Evening Post Magazine of the Art World</i>, December 18,         1928, p. 5) Le Corbusier briefly mentioned this under the heading of A         question of a new spirit.

Corbusier introduced this phrase in <i>Towards A New 		Architecture</i>, see p. 4. Although truncating Corbusier's phrase would 		have been a typical word game for Fuller, &quot;machine for living&quot; 		is thought to have first been associated with Fuller in the article &quot;Buckminster 		Fuller: The Dymaxion Architect,&quot; <i>Time</i>, Vol. 83, No. 2, January 		10, 1964, p. 48. Amusingly, the article refers to Corbusier's axiom &quot;machine 		for living in&quot; (machine &agrave; habiter) as &quot;machine-for-living.&quot; 		Ed Applewhite, who compiled a the four volume <i>Synergetics Dictionary</i>, 		a catalogue of Fuller's words and sayings, believes &quot;machine for 		living&quot; was first used relationship to Fuller's work in <i>The Dymaxion 		Architect</i>.</p>      <p class="eighth">35.

As with Fuller and the Dymaxion House, the maturation         of the ideas Corbusier expressed in the Villa Savoye resulted from a long         period of development. The Villa Savoye is considered to be the culmination         of ideas which were initiated with Corbusier's 1919-1920 project for the         Citrohan House. For a history of this development see Tim Benton, Villa         Savoye and the Architects' Practice, in H. Allen Brooks, ed., <i>Le Corbusier:         The Garland Essays</i>, New York: Garland, 1987, pp. 83-105 and Tim Benton,         <i>The Villas of Le Corbusier</i>, 1920-1930, New Haven: Yale University         Press, 1987.</p>      <p class="eighth">37. Fuller addresses the issue of mobility in <i>4D Time         Lock</i> on page 63 as part of <i>The 4D Letters Patent</i> where he writes:         &quot;In a dwelling intended for quick and easy and erection and subsequent         moving from place to place with relatively great facility, the weight         of the structure itself becomes a significant item.&quot; A lengthy discussion         of mobility is provided in the reproduction of his August 31, 1928 letter         to George Buffington. The excerpts relevant to the issue of mobility are         as follows:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth">&quot;[...]4D mobile, lightful, 20th century tower housing[...]is           a subject of common progressive, harmonic, and creative interest[...]4D           tower housing represents spirit of freedom that is synonymous with American[...]time           is new currency, new base of economy[...]owning property is feudalistic[...]Economics           are dependent upon free mobile individualism which is the antithesis           of static properties[...]With the establishment of the new mobile housing           industry, will the other industries of automobile, airplane, radio,           furnishings, etc., no matter how complimentary to the main housing,           assume the proportions of the motor launches, airplanes, and myriad           other gear, to the main battleship, being but accessories of convenience.&quot;           (pp. 120-132)</p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">38. <i>The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller</i>, p.         13.</p>      <p class="eighth">39. Ibid., pp. 17-18. In the 1950s, Fuller's ideal of         transporting houses by air was realized when geodesic domes were transported         by helicopters. Fuller was enamored by the technology of the airplane         and the potential he saw in using the sky as a second &quot;ocean.&quot;         According to Fuller, the sky ocean, unlike the water ocean, completely         surrounds the Earth and provides direct access to all points on it. In         terms of using the airplane as a means of transporting assembled buildings,         there are limitations placed upon the size and weight of the structures.         Of course, reducing the weight of buildings was one of Fuller's design         criteria. And, ground transportation systems do impose limitations upon         the design of mass-produced housing. For example, Allan Wallis argued         that the width of trailers was restricted by the width of highway lanes         in <i>Wheel Estate: The Rise and Decline of Mobile Homes</i>, New York:         Oxford University Press, 1994.</p>      <p class="eighth">40.
