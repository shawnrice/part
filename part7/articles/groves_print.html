Yet, by 1966, it had ceased to be a novelty.         During this 'honeymoon,' many people dreamed of a home that was centered         around the TV set. This led to TV rooms, TV furniture, TV food - even         TV clothes. Only a month after television officially started in Australia,         the author of <i>Accent on Design for TV Viewing</i> observed: &quot;TV         is having far reaching effects already. Special fashions have been designed         for TV viewing so that the acme of comfort can be enjoyed while you relax         in a specially designed TV chair and eat a TV meal from a TV tray.&quot;         <sup>1</sup> </p>      <p class="eighth"><i>Accent on Design for TV Viewing</i> featured two women's         casual TV outfits by Australian fashion designer Dena of Leroy that were         described &quot;as up to the minute as TV itself.<sup>2</sup> One, designed         &quot;for TV viewing at home on hot summer evenings,<sup>3</sup> was comprised         of a red and black polka-dot tunic and matching short shorts. The other         was &quot;smart and comfortable for a TV party.<sup>4</sup> It consisted         of a &quot;little boy shirt&quot; with three-quarter sleeves and &quot;matador         pants&quot; below the knees.<sup>5</sup> Both TV outfits were made from         non-crushable fabric, because &quot;televiewers are likely to spend hours         curled in a chair or sitting on the floor.<sup>6</sup> They also had &quot;particularly         interesting back necklines [...] because the back of a [TV] viewer will         be seen by others.<sup>7</sup> This happened whenever it was necessary         to arrange the chairs in rows, as at a cinema, to accommodate everyone         who wanted to watch television. </p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Formal TV Dresses</b><br>        Television also influenced women's formal dresses, a trend that spread         to Australia from overseas. Four years before the introduction of television         in Australia, the author of the 1952 article N<i>ow -- TV Dresses: Designers         Are on the &quot;Beam&quot;</i> wrote: &quot;World famous designers are         making clothes specially for 'TV evenings,' and even though Australian         women haven't got television to keep them at home in the evenings, a whole         new style of home entertaining has led to a new field of fashion --Evenings-at-Home         clothes.<sup>8</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">This article featured two TV dresses by French fashion         designer Jacques Heim, who was famous for helping to introduce the bikini.         One consisted of a full-length black-and-white velvet dress with three-quarter         sleeves. A taffeta apron with a deep side pocket was worn over this dress         to protect it when TV snacks were being served. The other TV dress had         a decollate bodice with long sleeves, a full-length faille skirt split         to the waist, and knee-length satin &quot;TV bloomers.<sup>9</sup> It         was futuristic in style, looking remarkably like the dress worn by space-age         teenager Judy Jetson in the 1962 TV cartoon series, The Jetsons. Shortly         before television started in Melbourne, Woman's Day fashion editor Isobel         Kennedy presented a selection of formal dresses by Australian fashion         designer Stell-Ricks and hats by Australian milliner Noisette. According         to Kennedy, these clothes were &quot;as new to the scene as the TV camera.<sup>10</sup>         In fact, the clothing's connection to the newness of television was increased         by being photographed in front of the &quot;partly-built main [TV] studio         at [channel] H.S.V. 7&quot;<sup>11</sup> in Melbourne. </p>      <p class="eighth">In 1956, Furs Ren&eacute;e of Melbourne introduced women's         waist-length coats with three-quarter sleeves in either mole skin or suede         which were &quot;specially designed for televiewing.<sup>12</sup> The         short sleeve-length was explained as more practical in order &quot;to         simplify the hostess' duties of serving food during TV shows.<sup>13</sup></p>      <p class="eighth"><b>A Woman's Work Is Never Done</b><br>        Three-quarter sleeves were a common feature of women's TV clothes. For         example, among the clothes mentioned so far, the &quot;little boy shirt&quot;         by Dena of Leroy, the black-and-white &quot;television dress&quot; by         Jacques Heim, and the &quot;TV jackets&quot; by Furs Ren&eacute;e all         had three-quarter sleeves. It was claimed that three-quarter sleeves simplified         serving TV snacks, but was there more to them than simply that?</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/groves_1a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 1:</b> TV knitting: Patons               Tee Vee Knitting Book No.1 (Melbourne: Patons and Baldwins (Australia)               Limited, n.d.).</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">Many Australians with a protestant work ethic felt guilty         about watching television. According to the architectural historian Witold         Rybczynski one of the main tenets of the protestant work ethic is that         &quot;leisure without toil, or disconnected from it, is altogether sinister.<sup>14</sup>         Therefore, to stop feeling guilty these people had to reconcile watching         television with doing work. For example, special TV knitting pattern books         were published (Fig 1). Women's TV clothes with three-quarter sleeves         was another way of reconciling this dilemma since three-quarter sleeves         are a stylish form of rolled-up sleeves. And, rolled-up sleeves are a         deep-seated symbol of work which meant that women&quot;s TV clothes with         three-quarter sleeves were also work clothes - at least symbolically.         This may also have been the 'true' reason behind the apron worn over Jacques         Heim included with his TV dress. Before television, most women who were         able to afford French-designer clothes probably would not have even considered         wearing an apron while entertaining guests.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Female TV Stars</b><br>        Women's fashion was also influenced by what female TV stars wore on television.         For example, during the 1962 Christmas season, the author of <i>I Want         a Stethoscope for Christmas: TV Fads Take Over at the Gift Counter</i>         reported: &quot;Appearing in American stores at the present time are copies         of dresses worn in a TV wedding shown in the Father of the Bride series.<sup>15</sup>         A leading U.S. merchandiser of women's clothes also explained in this         article: &quot;It's natural that when a woman goes shopping she will always         reach for something bearing the name of her favorite, in preference to         similar products that haven't been tied-in with a popular TV identity         or show.<sup>16</sup></p>      <p class="eighth"> Many Australian women also wanted to dress like their         favorite female TV stars. In 1961, the Australian weekly magazine, <i>Woman's         Day with Woman</i>, offered sewing patterns for dresses worn by Panda         Lisner, a performer on <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>, a variety show on         the local Melbourne channel GTV 9, and Del Cartwright, the host of <i>Your         Home</i>, a home-making program on Sydney's ATN 7. The magazine claimed:         &quot;Using our special pattern offer you can copy these TV stars&quot;         dresses for [4 shillings and 6 pence or 45 cents] each.<sup>17</sup> Apparently,         it was not only easy to dress like a glamorous TV star, but it was inexpensive         as well!</p>      <p class="eighth">The clothing of Lisner and Cartwright was probably chosen         because they appealed to a variety of women. For one thing, Lisner lived         in Melbourne and Cartwright came from Sydney. For another, although both         were popular and pretty, Lisner was a 'dumb blonde' (or at least she pretended         to be), while Cartwright was an expert cook and dressmaker. These differences         offered the potential of reaching different markets in different cities.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Daytime TV</b><br>        Some daytime TV shows included dressmaking demonstrations. New York sewing         expert Lucille Rivers toured Australia in 1959 and 1961 demonstrating         dressmaking at shopping centers and on television. She explained in the         1959 article <i>Practical Dressmaker</i> that: &quot;Television is a wonderful         medium for sewing demonstrations, because all the time you have a close-up         view of what I'm doing.<sup>18</sup> However, TV dressmaking demonstrations         were often confusing, because they were seldom carried out in 'real time.'         For example, Rivers always made the various stages of a dress off camera         &quot;so that she doesn't waste TV time by sewing it all on camera.<sup>19</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Some daytime TV shows also encouraged women to be fashion-conscious.         For example, <i>A Woman with More Taste than Money</i> hosted by Sydney         model Libby Mendelsohn on A.T.N. 7 was &quot;designed to show how girls         can dress well with economy.<sup>20</sup> Mendelsohn worked variety into         her show to attract repeat viewers: &quot;Libby takes different themes         for her program. Always emphasizing ways to attain the greatest variety         in clothes and accessories at minimum costs, Libby shows what to wear         on various occasions - at a picnic, at the races, on the day a girl becomes         engaged.<sup>21</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">However, one of the most popular TV shows of this kind         was <i>My Fair Lady</i> which was broadcast on the nation-wide Channel         7. Charles Bush, a Melbourne artist, hosted this program. On each show         he would tell three women, willingly selected from the studio audience,         what he thought of their appearance. Typical of his insulting comments         were: &quot;Your hair looks like a bird's nest&quot; and &quot;I never         saw a witch in broad daylight before - where did you get that hat?<sup>22</sup>         At the end of each show, the audience would choose the most 'frumpish'         of the three contestants to win prizes, including a new outfit of clothes         and a new hairdo. This 'lucky' woman would then reappear on the next show         looking 'glamorous' thanks to the prizes she had won. Television shows         like Rivers' and Mendelsohn's, and even Bush's, were not only entertaining         but also informative. They were another means of reconciling watching         television with doing work in the form of personal development. </p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Women's TV Shoes</b><br>        The introduction of television in Australia also influenced women's footwear.         In 1956, the Australian shoe manufacturer Knights produced special women's         slippers &quot;for TV hostesses.<sup>23</sup> A 1956 advertisement showed         four women all wearing Knights TV slippers and watching television. It         also described these slippers as &quot;glamorous&quot; because they were         &quot;touched with gold&quot; by being &quot;delicately embroidered&quot;         with gold colored tinsel.<sup>24</sup> However, almost anything associated         with television was considered to be glamorous in 1956.</p>      <p class="eighth">In 1957, Australian footwear manufacturer Ralph Grosby         introduced 'Televettes,' a new range of women's casual flat-heeled shoes         described in an advertisement as &quot;newer than television.<sup>25</sup>         In this ad a young woman is dancing to the music from a TV set in a pair         of Grosby Televettes. These shoes were also suitable to wear at popular         TV parties.</p>      <p class="eighth">The idea of TV shoes may seem strange. Nowadays, most         people wish to relax while watching television, so they are more likely         to take their shoes off than put them on. In Australia during the late         1950s, however, watching television was largely a social event and getting         dressed-up to either entertain guests at home or visit someone else's         home was the polite thing to do. </p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Male TV Stars</b><br>        In <i>Fashion Plates: TV Shows the Way</i>, 1962, TV Times journalist         Rosemary McAllister interviewed the editor of Tailor and Men's Wear Australasia,         Paul B. Nelson. Nelson was critical of the way some male TV stars dressed,         in particular Johnny O'Keefe, the Australian rock 'n' roll idol and host         of Six O'clock Rock on the national Channel 2.<sup>26</sup> According         to Nelson: &quot;Now that [Johnny O'Keefe] has left the lurid stage behind         him, Johnny looks a much better dressed young man. However, he is still         guilty of errors of taste in fashion. I recall that when he last went         to America he took with him a morning suit with striped trousers to wear         at an official reception in New York. A young man should be what he is.         He should not try to dress like some dignitary.<sup>27</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Yet, Nelson thought that television had generally improved         how Australian young men dressed, saying: &quot;Once upon a time, our         young fellows made a studied effort to be untidy. Now they are dressing         up, wearing well-styled clothes; to such an extent that the &quot;bodgie&quot;         has become almost a rarity. Of course, our young men don't wear hats as         much as they should. Still, they are vastly better dressed on the whole         than they were before television came along.<sup>28</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Nelson was full of praise for several male TV stars, including         Digby Wolfe, the host of Revue '61 and Revue '62, variety shows on Channel         7. According to a rather snobbish Nelson: &quot;Digby dresses very well         indeed. He achieves a quiet elegance. You can see it in the way he knots         his tie, the way he always shows half an inch of cuff. Of course, he's         British, and the British have a way of doing that.<sup>29</sup> Wolfe         usually wore a black cross-over bow tie and a white shirt with a button-down         collar on television and started a fashion trend. In <i>I Want a Stethoscope         for Christmas</i>, an executive from a leading Sydney menswear store claimed:         &quot;Digby Wolfe's use of the cross-over bow tie and button-down collar         in Revue '62 had a lot to do with making these items popular.<sup>30</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Wolfe's crisp TV appearance benefitted from a technological         advantage that he had over other TV stars - at least for a while. Revue         '61 was the first Australian TV show to use TV cameras fitted with diopter         lenses, which significantly reduced the impact of glare. These lenses         enabled Wolfe to wear a black dinner suit and a white shirt on the show.         Prior to the use of diopter lenses, TV stars could not wear black and         white clothes on television. For example, Bob and Dolly Dyer, the co-hosts         of the <i>Pick-A-Box</i>, a quiz show the national Channel 9, could only         wear pastel clothes on camera in 1957. As Woman's Day with Woman journalist         Fay Patience reported at the time: &quot;Dolly is limited to choosing         dresses that are pastel in color and without too much pattern. Black and         white or striped dresses are definitely out for television. The same rule         applies to Bob. All his suits are in midnight blue shades or greys with         pastel shirts and handkerchiefs.<sup>31</sup></p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Graham Kennedy</b><br>        Another television personality who had a big impact on men's clothing         was Graham Kennedy. He was the witty, sometimes smutty, much loved host         of <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>, which began in 1957 and ran for 13 years.         He was arguably Australia's biggest TV star. In 1966, the readers of the         Australian weekly television guide, TV Week, voted him 'Australian Television         Personality of the Decade.'<sup>32</sup> And, in 2000, the readers of         the Melbourne daily newspaper, the Herald-Sun, voted him their favorite         male TV star of the past 44 years, despite the fact that he had been retired         from television for ten years.<sup>33</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">As the host of <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>, Kennedy wore         &quot;Glo-Weave Fine Line, his favorite shirt since it was first introduced.<sup>34</sup>         Glo-Weave was one of the first sponsors of the program. The company quickly         capitalized on Kennedy's preference for its shirt. The relationship between         Kennedy and Glo-Weave was one of the subjects Bert Newton, Kennedy's straight         man on the show, discussed in his 1977 book <i>Bert! Bert Newton's Own         Story</i>. He wrote: &quot;Graham forced the Pelaco shirt empire to restructure         their marketing philosophies because he talked about a shirt on [<i>In         Melbourne Tonight</i>] which was made in a backyard factory, called Glo-Weave.         Glo-Weave's owner, Sol Same, achieved huge national sales of his shirts         because he had the courage to advertise with Graham Kennedy and put Graham's         photograph on his boxed shirts.&quot;<sup>35</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Another early sponsor of <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i> was         Australian shoe manufacturer Raoul Merton. According to Newton, the Raoul         Merton commercials that he and Kennedy performed together on the show         &quot;changed the footwear buying habits for men.<sup>36</sup> In his         second book, Bert Newton: My Australia (1983), Newton recalled the success         of their first Raoul Merton commercial: &quot;The commercial was meant         to be a thirty seconder. We ad libbed it for twenty-seven minutes, rubbishing         the shoes, the price, and the company's managing director Bill Muddyman,         who was in a state of shock [...] until next day when shoe shops all over         Melbourne were calling urgently for supplies of his shoes. A great ripple         had been caused on the lake of television when people suddenly realized         that a twenty-seven-minute commercial could become a vibrant part of a         ninety-minute variety show. I have no doubt that the Raoul Merton commercials         have had more impact on a television audience than any others in this         country.<sup>37</sup></p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Behind the TV Cameras</b><br>        In the Australia of 1956 jobs behind the TV camera were considered to         be almost as glamorous as those in front of it. A number of advertisements         for men's clothes played on the perception that working behind-the-scenes         in television was a glamorous occupation. For example, a 1964 advertisement         for Sax Altmans, an Australian men's clothing manufacturer, showed three         men from the waist down who were all wearing Sax Altmans trousers and         working at a TV studio. The caption read: &quot;Do &pound;7/19/6<sup>38</sup>         slacks go with a TV Directorship and a &pound;10,000 penthouse - Yes -         when they are Sax Altmans. Leaders in the celebrity-studded TV world have         demanding tastes and a high price-tag is seldom a deterrent when they         buy. Yet in slacks they prefer Sax Altmans - even to famous expensive         importeds. Why? Because they want the best fashion, fabrics, craftsmanship,         comfort and they know Sax Altmans have it. That Sax Altmans slacks cost         no more than ordinary trousers surprises them, certainly, but they find         the surprise 'pleasant.' SO WILL YOU.<sup>39</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">The Australian yarn manufacturer Patons published the         undated Patons Knitting Book 860 which featured several suave-looking         men working at a TV studio and wearing sweaters knitted with Totem, one         of its wool brands. The book explained that these were: &quot;Men, at         ease [...] catching up on a special fascination - the absorbing, behind-the-scenes         world of T.V. Playing at being television buffs. Directing the show. Calling         the cues. Applauding the performance. And doing it all stylishly. Because         style is the essence of Totem.<sup>40</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">The advertisements for Sax Altmans and the knitting book         by Patons saw the television industry in a light similar to fast cars         and power tools. They suggested that it was exclusive and glamorous and         that men in particular were fascinated by it. They also implied that the         kind of men who wore off-the-peg trousers and hand-knitted sweaters were         in charge of the television industry. But most 'ordinary' men had no idea         how the TV set in their living-room worked, let alone how a TV show was         put together.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>TV Pyjamas</b><br>        During the late 1950s, in some circles it was quite fashionable to wear         pyjamas around the house. For example, a 1957 advertisement for Australian-made         Crystal pyjamas declared: &quot;Gad, what'll they think of next? Time         was when pyjamas were 'unmentionables' and you'd have had a fit if caught         in them. But suddenly it's 1957. Pyjamas are not only respectable, but         let's face it, even fashionable. People do their housework in them, watch         TV in them and -- inevitably - go to parties in them.<sup>41</sup> Perhaps         one reason for this was the popularity of <i>The Pajama Game</i>, a U.S.         musical comedy about love versus trade union policy in a pyjama factory.         It included several hit songs in the play like 'Hey There' and 'Hernando's         Hideaway.' In Australia, the stage production of The Pajama Game, starring         local performers Toni Lamond and Bill Newman, premiered in Melbourne in         January 1957.<sup>42</sup> The Hollywood film version of <i>The Pajama         Game</i>, starring Doris Day and Broadway baritone John Rait, was released         in November of the same year.<sup>43</sup></p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/groves_2a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> TV pyjamas: Bond's               advertisement, The Australian Women's Weekly, 13 May 1959.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">Another reason why pyjamas were so popular in Australia         at this time was the introduction of television, fig. 2. Many people liked         to watch television dressed in their pyjamas, because they felt comfortable.         As with Heim's TV apron and Knights TV slippers, television was largely         responsible for elevating pyjamas from the mundane to the (almost) glamorous.         In 1956, Australian clothing manufacturer Bond's began making 'Look-Alike'         TV Pyjamas for mothers and daughters with loose-fitting candy-striped         jackets and plain pants. In a 1956 advertisement, Betty Bond, the public         face of Bond's, declared: &quot;I wear my Bond's 'Look-Alike' pyjamas         every night I watch TV at home. Don't even mind when unexpected visitors         call because I feel quite dressed!<sup>44</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">Following Bond's lead, other Australian clothing manufacturers         also began producing women's TV pyjamas. For example, in 1957, Kayser         produced two styles of women's pyjamas &quot;designed specially for sitting         in front of the fire with a TV set.<sup>45</sup> One had a short-sleeved         jacket and long pants. The other style had a jacket with three-quarter-length         sleeves and pants cut below the knees, closely resembling one of the TV         outfits designed by Dena of Leroy (described earlier). Perhaps the message         was that TV pyjamas were just as fashionable as daytime TV clothes, and         daytime TV clothes were just as comfortable as TV pyjamas.</p>      <p class="eighth">Initially, TV pyjamas were made only for females. When         males watched television dressed in pyjamas, they usually wore a dressing-gown         as well. One reason for this was that men's pyjama pants had an open fly,         and nobody wanted to 'flash' unintentionally. Australian clothing manufacturer         Onkaparinga made men's pure wool dressing-gowns. A 1959 advertisement         showed Onkaparinga's mascot, a cute cartoon lamb, wearing a dressing-gown         and watching television.<sup>46</sup> In 1959, Bond's<sup>47</sup> and         another Australian clothing company, Exacto,<sup>48</sup> each began making         TV pyjamas for fathers and sons. Now the whole family could wear TV pyjamas.         Furthermore, males could now wear TV pyjamas without also wearing a dressing-gown         since these pants did not have a fly.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/groves_3a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Style Knits by Patons,               vol.17 (Melbourne: Patons and Baldwins (Australia) Limited, n.d.)</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth"><b>Conclusion</b><br>        The introduction of television in Australia in 1956 influenced many aspects         of everyday life. Some of these were quite unexpected, such as the design         of women's and men's clothing, fig. 3. Television clothes were meant to         be both glamorous and serviceable - two largely opposing concepts before         the advent of television. This was true regardless of whether the item         of TV clothing was a fur coat or a pair of slippers. Television also became         the ultimate taste-maker. TV shows like <i>A Woman with More Taste than         Money</i>, began to set fashion trends - once almost the exclusive domain         of women's fashion magazines. Furthermore, adults and children wanted         to dress like their favorite TV stars, which proved to be a windfall for         those astute clothing manufacturers who secured the likes of Graham Kennedy         to endorse their goods. In Australia, until about 1966, almost anything         associated with television was immediately assumed to be exciting and         new. On one hand, television was a great boost for the fashion industry.         On the other, the fashion industry helped to legitimize watching television         as a productive activity, especially for women.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Notes:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">1. <i>Accent on Design for TV Viewing</i>, Listener-In         (October 27 - November 2,1956): 29.</p>      <p class="eighth">2.
