The adding machine, motorized factory equipment, the assembly         line, and the automobile--all of these inventions urged people to pick         up the pace of daily life and work. Even the home, the &quot;haven in         a heartless world,&quot; was not a shelter from time-saving technology.         Middle-class homemakers eagerly followed the twentieth-century trend and         modernized their homes, but soon realized that they had to learn to adapt         their daily routines to the unforeseen changes that new technology brought.</p>      <p class="eighth">With the introduction of gas- and electric-powered appliances         such as ranges, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines,         the modern woman's workday necessarily changed. Like contemporary workers         in modernized factories, homemakers were under pressure to speed up their         work and do more than before. They sought advice on how to make the transition         to the world of modern homemaking.</p>      <p class="eighth">But, homemakers were not the first to seek advice. The         profession of the efficiency expert, or scientific manager, arose at the         turn of the century specifically to address the problems that new technology         presented to industrial labor and the corporate world. These experts were,         for the most part, self-employed consultants, who were hired by businesses         to improve efficiency in their factories and, sometimes, their offices.         The most famous efficiency expert was Frederick Winslow Taylor, whose         hallmark scientific management techniques showed how a worker on an assembly         line might work more quickly. The technique was to watch the motions of         the worker. Did he or she need to walk a distance to pick up a part from         another workstation? Or, was the worker standing in the wrong place in         relation to the machinery and consequently having a difficult time seeing         what was being done? For Taylor, finding the optimum arrangement of worker         and machine would keep the process of work going smoothly, thus maximizing         the output of the worker and factory. This was good for the company's         bottom line.</p>      <p class="eighth">Frederick Taylor had several consultants working for him.         One of them was Frank Gilbreth. Gilbreth came up with a few ideas of his         own and broke away from Taylor. Then, with his wife Lillian (Fig. 1),         he set up an independent consulting business, Gilbreth Inc. In the years         of their marriage, from 1904 to 1924, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were         efficiency consultants to business and industry. Like Taylor, they were         interested in speed, but they added an element to the practice of efficiency:         reducing fatigue. They believed that fatigue slowed a worker down.</p>      <p class="eighth">In the years of their marriage and business partnership,         the Gilbreths were hired by many organizations, from the United States         Army to the American Heart Association. All wanted advice on how to maximize         efficiency and reduce fatigue in a variety of work situations.</p>      <p class="eighth">Industrial work had been a lucrative source of income         for the Gilbreths. Companies that hired them were willing to invest in         consultants in order to increase efficiency and boost profits. But the         Gilbreths were believers that their ideas of efficient work were for everyone,         not just big business. Their goals and beliefs were very fitting for the         Progressive Era, of which they were firmly a part. They practiced what         they preached. They worked out of their home in Montclair, New Jersey         and used their household as a laboratory of sorts. Anyone who knows the         popular story entitled &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; will know that         the Gilbreths believed efficiency should start at home! The story, which         was made into a movie, was written by the Gilbreth children and told how         every household activity became a study in saving time and energy, from         taking a bath to packing suitcases for vacation.</p>      <p class="eighth">When Frank Gilbreth died suddenly in 1924, Lillian Gilbreth         faced a desperate situation. The couple had eleven children, ten of whom         were living at home. Because of their large family and because they constantly         put money back into the business, Lillian could not retire upon Frank's         death. She decided to forge ahead with the efficiency business. She continued         to seek clients in industry, but also employed her scientific management         expertise in a more freelance way by writing advice manuals for women         about household work.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/buschk_2a.jpg" width="230" height="95" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> Lillian Gilbreth advised               the homemaker to create a detailed schedule of her day's activities,               using a form like this one. This was the type of form that the Gilbreths               advised their industrial clients to use. From Lillian Gilbreth,               The Home-Maker and Her Job (New York: D. Appleton, 1927)</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">Lillian had a wealth of experience and case studies in         household efficiency. A businesswoman, a trained industrial engineer,         and a Ph.D. in management psychology, she had an unusual but handy combination         of skills and experience. While she was not a member of the home economics         profession per se, she ventured into that territory with the publication         of her first household advice manual, <i>The Home-Maker and Her Job</i>         in 1927. She wrote her book for middle-class homemakers of the 1920s who         faced the dual realities of having no hired household help but a heap         of new labor-saving appliances. In <i>The Home-Maker and Her Job</i>,         Gilbreth sought to inspire homemakers to think of their homes also as         workplaces and to plan their space and their time accordingly. Essentially,         she urged them to employ some of the same measures that the Gilbreths         had implemented in their factory consulting work.<br>        When the Gilbreths did work for industry, their results were easy to measure.         A company would ask them to figure out how to produce more widgets per         hour. Or, to design a work station that would eliminate leg or back strain.         The result could be seen in greater factory output or fewer complaints         of fatigue and fewer breaks or even sick-days.<br>      </p>      <p class="eighth"> It could not be debated that homemakers <i>did</i> work         all day, but did they view their homes as actual workplaces? The question         may not be how a homemaker could bake more pies per hour. Rather, could         she finish her chores earlier in order to have more time to read to her         daughter? Or, could she use time-saving appliances more efficiently to         make fewer trips up and down the stairs? Were these workplaces inefficient?         Did the new appliances help or hinder the work process? Was the work day         unplanned? In essence, did chaos reign? If so, then the homemaker would         likely feel stressed, fatigued, and out of control. What Gilbreth emphasized         in <i>The Home-Maker and Her Job</i> was the goal of &quot;happiness minutes&quot;--moments         when everything would come together and there would be a sense of peace         and accomplishment.</p>      <p class="eighth">In the home, on the other hand, the results could not         be measured in the same way. Gilbreth summed up the goal of efficiency         in the home as more &quot;happiness minutes.&quot; This would have seemed         silly to an industrialist, but Gilbreth could see no better way to measure         the overall result of having a more efficient home. Happiness minutes         occur when the homemaker is rested. When the household paperwork is organized         and the bills paid on time. When meals are planned and not stressfully         thrown together at the last minute. New time-saving appliances gave homemakers         more freedom--the freedom to take on more jobs, to make cooking more complex,         to make the house cleaner, but at a resulting price of having too much         to do and fewer minutes of happiness.</p>      <p class="eighth">Stepping back from the situation, one might point out         the obvious solution: just do less. Let the dust build up for a few more         days. Open a can of soup for dinner. Let all those expensive modern appliances         do the work. But, Gilbreth or any woman picking up a household advice         manual would recognize the note of surrender in these solutions. Their         assumption was that mom could and should be able to do it all. And, they         looked for the answer to the mystery of why those new gadgets did not         make the homemaker's day effortless. </p>      <p class="eighth">Historians have been searching for the answer, too. When         electricity and gas were introduced into homes in the early twentieth         century, they replaced elbow grease as the main power behind many household         jobs. Yet, the appliances frequently meant that effort was expended elsewhere.         For example, the cooking range replaced the wood or coal stove. This wonderful         appliance eliminated the need to fetch fuel and refill the power source.         It also made climate control in the kitchen a distinct possibility. However,         with an unbearably hot kitchen with coal or wood burning in the stove,         as was the old way, a homemaker might take some work outside--shelling         peas, sorting beans, peeling potatoes--while sitting in a chair on the         porch or in the yard to get some cool air. Importantly, she would be off         her feet for a while and getting a job done at the same time. With climate         control, it seemed more efficient just to stand at the sink in the kitchen         and get the job finished. Ranges that allowed varying temperatures on         various burners also allowed for cooking more complicated meals. Stew         and soup were fine sometimes, but fancier dishes with individual components--separately         cooked meats, vegetables, and of course desserts--became the standard         in modern cooking. This meant <i>more</i> time in the kitchen, <i>more</i>         preparation time, <i>more</i> standing at the range or countertop, not         less. The vacuum cleaner was another thrilling invention that replaced         the need to take out rugs and beat them. Of course, rugs were very infrequently         taken out, as this was a time-consuming and difficult job. However, vacuuming         could be done frequently, even daily. The vacuum was a very handy invention,         but one also had to carve out time to complete this new household task.         Technology in the home was, as it still is, a double-edged sword, cutting         work time in some cases, while adding chores and strain in others.</p>      <p class="eighth">Assessing the homemaker's situation, Gilbreth's advice         was based on the primary belief that fatigue is what prevents people from         working to their full potential. Disorder and the stress resulting from         it, Gilbreth said, was the primary cause of fatigue, both mental and physical.         It came primarily from two sources: a cluttered, disorganized home and         a lack of a plan for activity. A new technology like an electric egg beater         could be more fatiguing to use than a wire whisk if it was stored in the         back of a cabinet and was hard to dig out and put away, or if it needed         to be cleaned meticulously before and after every use. Too many appliances,         cluttering a countertop, Gilbreth explained, would become counterproductive         if they took away a workspace needed for chopping or mixing or if they         just made it difficult to find things. Gilbreth suggested that all appliances         may not be necessary. There was, she believed, such a thing as giving         in to all the sales pitches out there too easily. If one bought and deemed         an appliance worth keeping, only the ones that were used almost daily         should be out in plain sight and reach.</p>      <p class="eighth">A homemaker's daily and weekly plan for work was also         turned on its side by the industrial age. Beforehand, Mondays were washdays,         Tuesdays for ironing, and so forth because these were all-day activities         before the washing machine. Now, the convenience of a labor-saving appliance         meant that any day, any time, could be wash-day. Wash might be done more         frequently than once a week. Mondays need no longer be set aside, so new         activities could creep into the schedule. With the advent of the automobile,         women also could dash out of the home on errands. This was convenient,         but also made it harder to stick to a plan. So many possibilities, so         many things to do. This was mentally as well as physically fatiguing.</p>      <p class="eighth">To regain control, Gilbreth suggested that homemakers         chart their daily, weekly, and even yearly activities and those of all         members of their households. The family calendar, perhaps a staple of         most households today, was a new idea in the 1920s, and was borrowed from         industry, for which the Gilbreths set up schedule-keeping systems to keep         track of deliveries, payments, contract obligations, and the like. In         the home, Mother's, Father's, and each child's activities were to be noted         so that Mother may be aware of everyone's activities and appointments         because everyone's needs and activities affect the daily plan for the         homemaker.</p>      <p class="eighth">Difficult though it might be at first, Gilbreth said,         the homemaker too must make daily, weekly, even yearly work schedules         for herself. The homemaker had the advantage of being worker and manager.         As such she could manage her time the way she saw fit, but it must be         managed, or chaos and stress would result. Chaos and stress led inevitably         to fatigue. Fatigue made happiness minutes impossible. A schedule would         mean freedom from stress, rather than slavery to a deadline. Gilbreth         instructed the homemaker to make a chart, like a page from an appointment         book, and note everything she must do and at what time--rise and dress,         cook, make beds, do laundry, all the way down to putting the children         to sleep at night. The homemaker seeking happiness minutes would plan         wisely--plan to do the heaviest jobs when she knew she would have the         most energy. Unlike on the assembly line, in the household, there ought         to be a buffer of time between jobs. Gilbreth wrote, &quot;Most schedules         have been discarded because their makers forced more things into them         than they could be reasonably expected to contain.&quot; If the schedule         did not work, either a homemaker was not allowing enough time to complete         each task, or there were too many interruptions. A major culprit was the         telephone. Gilbreth advised women to &quot;disconnect the telephone.&quot;         The telephone, she understood, was a technology to add to the vacuum,         the egg-beater, and so forth that was a welcome addition to the household.         It could be valuable as a time-saving device to relay a message. However,         it could also be a terrible time-waster. Again, the homemaker had to eye         this technology with suspicion and be aware of its double-edged qualities.</p>      <p class="eighth">While chaos could be controlled and considerable mental         and physical fatigue alleviated with a workable schedule, Gilbreth cautioned         that boredom with tasks could similarly frustrate efficiency. Boredom         could breed resentment, leading to mental fatigue. Once a schedule was         in place, breaking it was fine once in a while, she explained, for the         mental exercise and the fresh outlook on things it would bring. Or, quite         simply, &quot;for the fun of breaking the schedule.&quot; Once again,         as manager and worker, the homemaker had the freedom to do this. Gilbreth         wrote: &quot;...efficiency is doing the thing in the best way to get the         desired results. And these [results], we must never forget, are the largest         number of happiness minutes for the largest amount of people.&quot;</p>      <p class="eighth">When Gilbreth's book appeared, there was no shortage of         advice for homemakers. The Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping         offered wisdom and tips every month. Cookbooks crowded the shelves, exclaiming         all of the fabulous dishes that could be prepared with modern cooking         equipment. Magazines with ads for shiny new appliances promised happiness         through more exciting menus. Yet, all of these fell short of what they         promised. Owning more complex equipment or making a job last longer were         taking the happiness out of a homemaker's day.</p>      <p class="eighth">Gilbreth's book stood out because it went to the heart         of the homemaker's situation: that modernization was making things more         difficult. Through her explanation of fatigue and scheduling, Gilbreth         showed homemakers why this was the case and urged them to reexamine the         way they did work. With only possibilities but no plan, a homemaker could         never feel as if she was getting her job done. But, when she knew her         tools and how to use them, when she had a schedule and completed it, a         homemaker could feel accomplished in her job. That sense of peace and         satisfaction would help her be a more accessible wife and mother and a         happier woman--if only for a few minutes at a time.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Sources:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">Cowan, Ruth Schwartz.<i> More Work for Mother: The Ironies         of Household Technology from the Open Hearth to the Microwave</i>.
