The adding machine, motorized factory equipment,               the assembly line, and the automobile--all of these inventions urged               people to pick up the pace of daily life and work. Even the home,               the &quot;haven in a heartless world,&quot; was not a shelter from               time-saving technology. Middle-class homemakers eagerly followed               the twentieth-century trend and modernized their homes, but soon               realized that they had to learn to adapt their daily routines to               the unforeseen changes that new technology brought.</p>            <p class="second">With the introduction of gas- and electric-powered               appliances such as ranges, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and washing               machines, the modern woman's workday necessarily changed. Like contemporary               workers in modernized factories, homemakers were under pressure               to speed up their work and do more than before. They sought advice               on how to make the transition to the world of modern homemaking.</p>            <p class="second">But, homemakers were not the first to seek advice.               The profession of the efficiency expert, or scientific manager,               arose at the turn of the century specifically to address the problems               that new technology presented to industrial labor and the corporate               world. These experts were, for the most part, self-employed consultants,               who were hired by businesses to improve efficiency in their factories               and, sometimes, their offices. The most famous efficiency expert               was Frederick Winslow Taylor, whose hallmark scientific management               techniques showed how a worker on an assembly line might work more               quickly. The technique was to watch the motions of the worker. Did               he or she need to walk a distance to pick up a part from another               workstation? Or, was the worker standing in the wrong place in relation               to the machinery and consequently having a difficult time seeing               what was being done? For Taylor, finding the optimum arrangement               of worker and machine would keep the process of work going smoothly,               thus maximizing the output of the worker and factory. This was good               for the company's bottom line.</p>            <p class="second">Frederick Taylor had several consultants working               for him. One of them was Frank Gilbreth. Gilbreth came up with a               few ideas of his own and broke away from Taylor. Then, with his               wife Lillian (Fig. 1), he set up an independent consulting business,               Gilbreth Inc. In the years of their marriage, from 1904 to 1924,               Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were efficiency consultants to business               and industry. Like Taylor, they were interested in speed, but they               added an element to the practice of efficiency: reducing fatigue.               They believed that fatigue slowed a worker down.</p>            <p class="second">In the years of their marriage and business partnership,               the Gilbreths were hired by many organizations, from the United               States Army to the American Heart Association. All wanted advice               on how to maximize efficiency and reduce fatigue in a variety of               work situations.</p>            <p class="second">Industrial work had been a lucrative source of income               for the Gilbreths. Companies that hired them were willing to invest               in consultants in order to increase efficiency and boost profits.               But the Gilbreths were believers that their ideas of efficient work               were for everyone, not just big business. Their goals and beliefs               were very fitting for the Progressive Era, of which they were firmly               a part. They practiced what they preached. They worked out of their               home in Montclair, New Jersey and used their household as a laboratory               of sorts. Anyone who knows the popular story entitled &quot;Cheaper               by the Dozen&quot; will know that the Gilbreths believed efficiency               should start at home! The story, which was made into a movie, was               written by the Gilbreth children and told how every household activity               became a study in saving time and energy, from taking a bath to               packing suitcases for vacation.</p>            <p class="second">When Frank Gilbreth died suddenly in 1924, Lillian               Gilbreth faced a desperate situation. The couple had eleven children,               ten of whom were living at home. Because of their large family and               because they constantly put money back into the business, Lillian               could not retire upon Frank's death. She decided to forge ahead               with the efficiency business. She continued to seek clients in industry,               but also employed her scientific management expertise in a more               freelance way by writing advice manuals for women about household               work.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="buschk_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/buschk_2a.jpg" width="230" height="95" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="buschk_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b> Lillian Gilbreth advised the homemaker to create a detailed schedule of her day's activities, using a form like this one.

Appleton, 1927)</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Lillian had a wealth of experience and case studies               in household efficiency. A businesswoman, a trained industrial engineer,               and a Ph.D. in management psychology, she had an unusual but handy               combination of skills and experience. While she was not a member               of the home economics profession per se, she ventured into that               territory with the publication of her first household advice manual,               <i>The Home-Maker and Her Job</i> in 1927. She wrote her book for               middle-class homemakers of the 1920s who faced the dual realities               of having no hired household help but a heap of new labor-saving               appliances. In <i>The Home-Maker and Her Job</i>, Gilbreth sought               to inspire homemakers to think of their homes also as workplaces               and to plan their space and their time accordingly. Essentially,               she urged them to employ some of the same measures that the Gilbreths               had implemented in their factory consulting work.</p>            <p class="second">When the Gilbreths did work for industry, their               results were easy to measure. A company would ask them to figure               out how to produce more widgets per hour. Or, to design a work station               that would eliminate leg or back strain. The result could be seen               in greater factory output or fewer complaints of fatigue and fewer               breaks or even sick-days.<br>            </p>            <p class="second"> It could not be debated that homemakers <i>did</i>               work all day, but did they view their homes as actual workplaces?               The question may not be how a homemaker could bake more pies per               hour. Rather, could she finish her chores earlier in order to have               more time to read to her daughter? Or, could she use time-saving               appliances more efficiently to make fewer trips up and down the               stairs? Were these workplaces inefficient? Did the new appliances               help or hinder the work process? Was the work day unplanned? In               essence, did chaos reign? If so, then the homemaker would likely               feel stressed, fatigued, and out of control. What Gilbreth emphasized               in <i>The Home-Maker and Her Job</i> was the goal of &quot;happiness               minutes&quot;--moments when everything would come together and there               would be a sense of peace and accomplishment.</p>            <p class="second">In the home, on the other hand, the results could               not be measured in the same way. Gilbreth summed up the goal of               efficiency in the home as more &quot;happiness minutes.&quot; This               would have seemed silly to an industrialist, but Gilbreth could               see no better way to measure the overall result of having a more               efficient home. Happiness minutes occur when the homemaker is rested.               When the household paperwork is organized and the bills paid on               time. When meals are planned and not stressfully thrown together               at the last minute. New time-saving appliances gave homemakers more               freedom--the freedom to take on more jobs, to make cooking more               complex, to make the house cleaner, but at a resulting price of               having too much to do and fewer minutes of happiness.</p>            <p class="second">Stepping back from the situation, one might point               out the obvious solution: just do less. Let the dust build up for               a few more days. Open a can of soup for dinner. Let all those expensive               modern appliances do the work. But, Gilbreth or any woman picking               up a household advice manual would recognize the note of surrender               in these solutions. Their assumption was that mom could and should               be able to do it all. And, they looked for the answer to the mystery               of why those new gadgets did not make the homemaker's day effortless.             </p>            <p class="second">Historians have been searching for the answer, too.               When electricity and gas were introduced into homes in the early               twentieth century, they replaced elbow grease as the main power               behind many household jobs. Yet, the appliances frequently meant               that effort was expended elsewhere. For example, the cooking range               replaced the wood or coal stove. This wonderful appliance eliminated               the need to fetch fuel and refill the power source. It also made               climate control in the kitchen a distinct possibility. However,               with an unbearably hot kitchen with coal or wood burning in the               stove, as was the old way, a homemaker might take some work outside--shelling               peas, sorting beans, peeling potatoes--while sitting in a chair               on the porch or in the yard to get some cool air. Importantly, she               would be off her feet for a while and getting a job done at the               same time. With climate control, it seemed more efficient just to               stand at the sink in the kitchen and get the job finished. Ranges               that allowed varying temperatures on various burners also allowed               for cooking more complicated meals. Stew and soup were fine sometimes,               but fancier dishes with individual components--separately cooked               meats, vegetables, and of course desserts--became the standard in               modern cooking. This meant <i>more</i> time in the kitchen, <i>more</i>               preparation time, <i>more</i> standing at the range or countertop,               not less. The vacuum cleaner was another thrilling invention that               replaced the need to take out rugs and beat them. Of course, rugs               were very infrequently taken out, as this was a time-consuming and               difficult job. However, vacuuming could be done frequently, even               daily. The vacuum was a very handy invention, but one also had to               carve out time to complete this new household task. Technology in               the home was, as it still is, a double-edged sword, cutting work               time in some cases, while adding chores and strain in others.</p>            <p class="second">Assessing the homemaker's situation, Gilbreth's               advice was based on the primary belief that fatigue is what prevents               people from working to their full potential. Disorder and the stress               resulting from it, Gilbreth said, was the primary cause of fatigue,               both mental and physical. It came primarily from two sources: a               cluttered, disorganized home and a lack of a plan for activity.               A new technology like an electric egg beater could be more fatiguing               to use than a wire whisk if it was stored in the back of a cabinet               and was hard to dig out and put away, or if it needed to be cleaned               meticulously before and after every use. Too many appliances, cluttering               a countertop, Gilbreth explained, would become counterproductive               if they took away a workspace needed for chopping or mixing or if               they just made it difficult to find things. Gilbreth suggested that               all appliances may not be necessary. There was, she believed, such               a thing as giving in to all the sales pitches out there too easily.               If one bought and deemed an appliance worth keeping, only the ones               that were used almost daily should be out in plain sight and reach.</p>            <p class="second">A homemaker's daily and weekly plan for work was               also turned on its side by the industrial age. Beforehand, Mondays               were washdays, Tuesdays for ironing, and so forth because these               were all-day activities before the washing machine. Now, the convenience               of a labor-saving appliance meant that any day, any time, could               be wash-day. Wash might be done more frequently than once a week.               Mondays need no longer be set aside, so new activities could creep               into the schedule. With the advent of the automobile, women also               could dash out of the home on errands. This was convenient, but               also made it harder to stick to a plan. So many possibilities, so               many things to do. This was mentally as well as physically fatiguing.</p>            <p class="second">To regain control, Gilbreth suggested that homemakers               chart their daily, weekly, and even yearly activities and those               of all members of their households. The family calendar, perhaps               a staple of most households today, was a new idea in the 1920s,               and was borrowed from industry, for which the Gilbreths set up schedule-keeping               systems to keep track of deliveries, payments, contract obligations,               and the like. In the home, Mother's, Father's, and each child's               activities were to be noted so that Mother may be aware of everyone's               activities and appointments because everyone's needs and activities               affect the daily plan for the homemaker.</p>            <p class="second">Difficult though it might be at first, Gilbreth               said, the homemaker too must make daily, weekly, even yearly work               schedules for herself. The homemaker had the advantage of being               worker and manager. As such she could manage her time the way she               saw fit, but it must be managed, or chaos and stress would result.               Chaos and stress led inevitably to fatigue. Fatigue made happiness               minutes impossible. A schedule would mean freedom from stress, rather               than slavery to a deadline. Gilbreth instructed the homemaker to               make a chart, like a page from an appointment book, and note everything               she must do and at what time--rise and dress, cook, make beds, do               laundry, all the way down to putting the children to sleep at night.               The homemaker seeking happiness minutes would plan wisely--plan               to do the heaviest jobs when she knew she would have the most energy.               Unlike on the assembly line, in the household, there ought to be               a buffer of time between jobs. Gilbreth wrote, &quot;Most schedules               have been discarded because their makers forced more things into               them than they could be reasonably expected to contain.&quot; If               the schedule did not work, either a homemaker was not allowing enough               time to complete each task, or there were too many interruptions.               A major culprit was the telephone. Gilbreth advised women to &quot;disconnect               the telephone.&quot; The telephone, she understood, was a technology               to add to the vacuum, the egg-beater, and so forth that was a welcome               addition to the household. It could be valuable as a time-saving               device to relay a message. However, it could also be a terrible               time-waster. Again, the homemaker had to eye this technology with               suspicion and be aware of its double-edged qualities.</p>            <p class="second">While chaos could be controlled and considerable               mental and physical fatigue alleviated with a workable schedule,               Gilbreth cautioned that boredom with tasks could similarly frustrate               efficiency. Boredom could breed resentment, leading to mental fatigue.               Once a schedule was in place, breaking it was fine once in a while,               she explained, for the mental exercise and the fresh outlook on               things it would bring. Or, quite simply, &quot;for the fun of breaking               the schedule.&quot; Once again, as manager and worker, the homemaker               had the freedom to do this. Gilbreth wrote: &quot;...efficiency               is doing the thing in the best way to get the desired results. And               these [results], we must never forget, are the largest number of               happiness minutes for the largest amount of people.&quot;</p>            <p class="second">When Gilbreth's book appeared, there was no shortage               of advice for homemakers. The Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping               offered wisdom and tips every month. Cookbooks crowded the shelves,               exclaiming all of the fabulous dishes that could be prepared with               modern cooking equipment. Magazines with ads for shiny new appliances               promised happiness through more exciting menus. Yet, all of these               fell short of what they promised. Owning more complex equipment               or making a job last longer were taking the happiness out of a homemaker's               day.</p>            <p class="second">Gilbreth's book stood out because it went to the               heart of the homemaker's situation: that modernization was making               things more difficult. Through her explanation of fatigue and scheduling,               Gilbreth showed homemakers why this was the case and urged them               to reexamine the way they did work. With only possibilities but               no plan, a homemaker could never feel as if she was getting her               job done. But, when she knew her tools and how to use them, when               she had a schedule and completed it, a homemaker could feel accomplished               in her job. That sense of peace and satisfaction would help her               be a more accessible wife and mother and a happier woman--if only               for a few minutes at a time.</p>            <p class="second"><a href="buschk_notes.html">Sources&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="buschk_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../gr/parthome.gif" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&copy;       2001 P<i>ART</i> and Mary Ann Buschka.
