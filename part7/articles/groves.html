Yet, by 1966, it had ceased               to be a novelty. During this 'honeymoon,' many people dreamed of               a home that was centered around the TV set. This led to TV rooms,               TV furniture, TV food - even TV clothes. Only a month after television               officially started in Australia, the author of <i>Accent on Design               for TV Viewing</i> observed: &quot;TV is having far reaching effects               already. Special fashions have been designed for TV viewing so that               the acme of comfort can be enjoyed while you relax in a specially               designed TV chair and eat a TV meal from a TV tray.&quot; <sup>1</sup>             </p>            <p class="second"><i>Accent on Design for TV Viewing</i> featured               two women's casual TV outfits by Australian fashion designer Dena               of Leroy that were described &quot;as up to the minute as TV itself.<sup>2</sup>               One, designed &quot;for TV viewing at home on hot summer evenings,<sup>3</sup>               was comprised of a red and black polka-dot tunic and matching short               shorts. The other was &quot;smart and comfortable for a TV party.<sup>4</sup>               It consisted of a &quot;little boy shirt&quot; with three-quarter               sleeves and &quot;matador pants&quot; below the knees.<sup>5</sup> Both TV               outfits were made from non-crushable fabric, because &quot;televiewers               are likely to spend hours curled in a chair or sitting on the floor.<sup>6</sup>               They also had &quot;particularly interesting back necklines [...]               because the back of a [TV] viewer will be seen by others.<sup>7</sup> This               happened whenever it was necessary to arrange the chairs in rows,               as at a cinema, to accommodate everyone who wanted to watch television.             </p>            <p class="second"><b>Formal TV Dresses</b><br>              Television also influenced women's formal dresses, a trend that               spread to Australia from overseas. Four years before the introduction               of television in Australia, the author of the 1952 article N<i>ow               -- TV Dresses: Designers Are on the &quot;Beam&quot;</i> wrote:               &quot;World famous designers are making clothes specially for 'TV               evenings,' and even though Australian women haven't got television               to keep them at home in the evenings, a whole new style of home               entertaining has led to a new field of fashion --Evenings-at-Home               clothes.<sup>8</sup></p>            <p class="second">This article featured two TV dresses by French fashion               designer Jacques Heim, who was famous for helping to introduce the               bikini. One consisted of a full-length black-and-white velvet dress               with three-quarter sleeves. A taffeta apron with a deep side pocket               was worn over this dress to protect it when TV snacks were being               served. The other TV dress had a decollate bodice with long sleeves,               a full-length faille skirt split to the waist, and knee-length satin               &quot;TV bloomers.<sup>9</sup> It was futuristic in style, looking remarkably               like the dress worn by space-age teenager Judy Jetson in the 1962               TV cartoon series, The Jetsons. Shortly before television started               in Melbourne, Woman's Day fashion editor Isobel Kennedy presented               a selection of formal dresses by Australian fashion designer Stell-Ricks               and hats by Australian milliner Noisette. According to Kennedy,               these clothes were &quot;as new to the scene as the TV camera.<sup>10</sup>               In fact, the clothing's connection to the newness of television               was increased by being photographed in front of the &quot;partly-built               main [TV] studio at [channel] H.S.V. 7&quot;<sup>11</sup> in Melbourne. </p>            <p class="second">In 1956, Furs Ren&eacute;e of Melbourne introduced               women's waist-length coats with three-quarter sleeves in either               mole skin or suede which were &quot;specially designed for televiewing.<sup>12</sup>               The short sleeve-length was explained as more practical in order               &quot;to simplify the hostess' duties of serving food during TV               shows.<sup>13</sup></p>            <p class="second"><b>A Woman's Work Is Never Done</b><br>              Three-quarter sleeves were a common feature of women's TV clothes.               For example, among the clothes mentioned so far, the &quot;little               boy shirt&quot; by Dena of Leroy, the black-and-white &quot;television               dress&quot; by Jacques Heim, and the &quot;TV jackets&quot; by Furs               Ren&eacute;e all had three-quarter sleeves. It was claimed that               three-quarter sleeves simplified serving TV snacks, but was there               more to them than simply that?</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="groves_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/groves_1a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="groves_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     1:</b> TV knitting: Patons Tee Vee Knitting Book No.1 (Melbourne:                     Patons and Baldwins (Australia) Limited, n.d.).</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Many Australians with a protestant work ethic felt               guilty about watching television. According to the architectural               historian Witold Rybczynski one of the main tenets of the protestant               work ethic is that &quot;leisure without toil, or disconnected from               it, is altogether sinister.<sup>14</sup> Therefore, to stop feeling               guilty these people had to reconcile watching television with doing               work. For example, special TV knitting pattern books were published               (Fig 1). Women's TV clothes with three-quarter sleeves was another               way of reconciling this dilemma since three-quarter sleeves are               a stylish form of rolled-up sleeves. And, rolled-up sleeves are               a deep-seated symbol of work which meant that women&quot;s TV clothes               with three-quarter sleeves were also work clothes - at least symbolically.               This may also have been the 'true' reason behind the apron worn               over Jacques Heim included with his TV dress. Before television,               most women who were able to afford French-designer clothes probably               would not have even considered wearing an apron while entertaining               guests.</p>            <p class="second"><b>Female TV Stars</b><br>              Women's fashion was also influenced by what female TV stars wore               on television. For example, during the 1962 Christmas season, the               author of <i>I Want a Stethoscope for Christmas: TV Fads Take Over               at the Gift Counter</i> reported: &quot;Appearing in American stores               at the present time are copies of dresses worn in a TV wedding shown               in the Father of the Bride series.<sup>15</sup> A leading U.S. merchandiser               of women's clothes also explained in this article: &quot;It's natural               that when a woman goes shopping she will always reach for something               bearing the name of her favorite, in preference to similar products               that haven't been tied-in with a popular TV identity or show.<sup>16</sup></p>            <p class="second"> Many Australian women also wanted to dress like               their favorite female TV stars. In 1961, the Australian weekly magazine,               <i>Woman's Day with Woman</i>, offered sewing patterns for dresses               worn by Panda Lisner, a performer on <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>,               a variety show on the local Melbourne channel GTV 9, and Del Cartwright,               the host of <i>Your Home</i>, a home-making program on Sydney's               ATN 7. The magazine claimed: &quot;Using our special pattern offer               you can copy these TV stars&quot; dresses for [4 shillings and 6               pence or 45 cents] each.<sup>17</sup> Apparently, it was not only easy to dress               like a glamorous TV star, but it was inexpensive as well!</p>            <p class="second">The clothing of Lisner and Cartwright was probably               chosen because they appealed to a variety of women. For one thing,               Lisner lived in Melbourne and Cartwright came from Sydney. For another,               although both were popular and pretty, Lisner was a 'dumb blonde'               (or at least she pretended to be), while Cartwright was an expert               cook and dressmaker. These differences offered the potential of               reaching different markets in different cities.</p>            <p class="second"><b>Daytime TV</b><br>              Some daytime TV shows included dressmaking demonstrations. New York               sewing expert Lucille Rivers toured Australia in 1959 and 1961 demonstrating               dressmaking at shopping centers and on television. She explained               in the 1959 article <i>Practical Dressmaker</i> that: &quot;Television               is a wonderful medium for sewing demonstrations, because all the               time you have a close-up view of what I'm doing.<sup>18</sup> However, TV dressmaking               demonstrations were often confusing, because they were seldom carried               out in 'real time.' For example, Rivers always made the various               stages of a dress off camera &quot;so that she doesn't waste TV               time by sewing it all on camera.<sup>19</sup></p>            <p class="second">Some daytime TV shows also encouraged women to be               fashion-conscious. For example, <i>A Woman with More Taste than               Money</i> hosted by Sydney model Libby Mendelsohn on A.T.N. 7 was               &quot;designed to show how girls can dress well with economy.<sup>20</sup>               Mendelsohn worked variety into her show to attract repeat viewers:               &quot;Libby takes different themes for her program. Always emphasizing               ways to attain the greatest variety in clothes and accessories at               minimum costs, Libby shows what to wear on various occasions - at               a picnic, at the races, on the day a girl becomes engaged.<sup>21</sup></p>            <p class="second">However, one of the most popular TV shows of this               kind was <i>My Fair Lady</i> which was broadcast on the nation-wide               Channel 7. Charles Bush, a Melbourne artist, hosted this program.               On each show he would tell three women, willingly selected from               the studio audience, what he thought of their appearance. Typical               of his insulting comments were: &quot;Your hair looks like a bird's               nest&quot; and &quot;I never saw a witch in broad daylight before               - where did you get that hat?<sup>22</sup> At the end of each show, the audience               would choose the most 'frumpish' of the three contestants to win               prizes, including a new outfit of clothes and a new hairdo. This               'lucky' woman would then reappear on the next show looking 'glamorous'               thanks to the prizes she had won. Television shows like Rivers'               and Mendelsohn's, and even Bush's, were not only entertaining but               also informative. They were another means of reconciling watching               television with doing work in the form of personal development.             </p>            <p class="second"><b>Women's TV Shoes</b><br>              The introduction of television in Australia also influenced women's               footwear. In 1956, the Australian shoe manufacturer Knights produced               special women's slippers &quot;for TV hostesses.<sup>23</sup> A 1956 advertisement               showed four women all wearing Knights TV slippers and watching television.               It also described these slippers as &quot;glamorous&quot; because               they were &quot;touched with gold&quot; by being &quot;delicately               embroidered&quot; with gold colored tinsel.<sup>24</sup> However, almost anything               associated with television was considered to be glamorous in 1956.</p>            <p class="second">In 1957, Australian footwear manufacturer Ralph               Grosby introduced 'Televettes,' a new range of women's casual flat-heeled               shoes described in an advertisement as &quot;newer than television.<sup>25</sup>               In this ad a young woman is dancing to the music from a TV set in               a pair of Grosby Televettes. These shoes were also suitable to wear               at popular TV parties.</p>            <p class="second">The idea of TV shoes may seem strange. Nowadays,               most people wish to relax while watching television, so they are               more likely to take their shoes off than put them on. In Australia               during the late 1950s, however, watching television was largely               a social event and getting dressed-up to either entertain guests               at home or visit someone else's home was the polite thing to do.             </p>            <p class="second"><b>Male TV Stars</b><br>              In <i>Fashion Plates: TV Shows the Way</i>, 1962, TV Times journalist               Rosemary McAllister interviewed the editor of Tailor and Men's Wear               Australasia, Paul B. Nelson. Nelson was critical of the way some               male TV stars dressed, in particular Johnny O'Keefe, the Australian               rock 'n' roll idol and host of Six O'clock Rock on the national               Channel 2.<sup>26</sup> According to Nelson: &quot;Now that [Johnny O'Keefe]               has left the lurid stage behind him, Johnny looks a much better               dressed young man. However, he is still guilty of errors of taste               in fashion. I recall that when he last went to America he took with               him a morning suit with striped trousers to wear at an official               reception in New York. A young man should be what he is. He should               not try to dress like some dignitary.<sup>27</sup></p>            <p class="second">Yet, Nelson thought that television had generally               improved how Australian young men dressed, saying: &quot;Once upon               a time, our young fellows made a studied effort to be untidy. Now               they are dressing up, wearing well-styled clothes; to such an extent               that the &quot;bodgie&quot; has become almost a rarity. Of course,               our young men don't wear hats as much as they should. Still, they               are vastly better dressed on the whole than they were before television               came along.<sup>28</sup></p>            <p class="second">Nelson was full of praise for several male TV stars,               including Digby Wolfe, the host of Revue '61 and Revue '62, variety               shows on Channel 7. According to a rather snobbish Nelson: &quot;Digby               dresses very well indeed. He achieves a quiet elegance. You can               see it in the way he knots his tie, the way he always shows half               an inch of cuff. Of course, he's British, and the British have a               way of doing that.<sup>29</sup> Wolfe usually wore a black cross-over bow tie               and a white shirt with a button-down collar on television and started               a fashion trend. In <i>I Want a Stethoscope for Christmas</i>, an               executive from a leading Sydney menswear store claimed: &quot;Digby               Wolfe's use of the cross-over bow tie and button-down collar in               Revue '62 had a lot to do with making these items popular.<sup>30</sup></p>            <p class="second">Wolfe's crisp TV appearance benefitted from a technological               advantage that he had over other TV stars - at least for a while.               Revue '61 was the first Australian TV show to use TV cameras fitted               with diopter lenses, which significantly reduced the impact of glare.               These lenses enabled Wolfe to wear a black dinner suit and a white               shirt on the show. Prior to the use of diopter lenses, TV stars               could not wear black and white clothes on television. For example,               Bob and Dolly Dyer, the co-hosts of the <i>Pick-A-Box</i>, a quiz               show the national Channel 9, could only wear pastel clothes on camera               in 1957. As Woman's Day with Woman journalist Fay Patience reported               at the time: &quot;Dolly is limited to choosing dresses that are               pastel in color and without too much pattern. Black and white or               striped dresses are definitely out for television. The same rule               applies to Bob. All his suits are in midnight blue shades or greys               with pastel shirts and handkerchiefs.<sup>31</sup></p>            <p class="second"><b>Graham Kennedy</b><br>              Another television personality who had a big impact on men's clothing               was Graham Kennedy. He was the witty, sometimes smutty, much loved               host of <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>, which began in 1957 and ran               for 13 years. He was arguably Australia's biggest TV star. In 1966,               the readers of the Australian weekly television guide, TV Week,               voted him 'Australian Television Personality of the Decade.'<sup>32</sup> And,               in 2000, the readers of the Melbourne daily newspaper, the Herald-Sun,               voted him their favorite male TV star of the past 44 years, despite               the fact that he had been retired from television for ten years.<sup>33</sup></p>            <p class="second">As the host of <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>, Kennedy               wore &quot;Glo-Weave Fine Line, his favorite shirt since it was               first introduced.<sup>34</sup> Glo-Weave was one of the first sponsors of the               program. The company quickly capitalized on Kennedy's preference               for its shirt. The relationship between Kennedy and Glo-Weave was               one of the subjects Bert Newton, Kennedy's straight man on the show,               discussed in his 1977 book <i>Bert! Bert Newton's Own Story</i>.               He wrote: &quot;Graham forced the Pelaco shirt empire to restructure               their marketing philosophies because he talked about a shirt on               [<i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>] which was made in a backyard factory,               called Glo-Weave. Glo-Weave's owner, Sol Same, achieved huge national               sales of his shirts because he had the courage to advertise with               Graham Kennedy and put Graham's photograph on his boxed shirts.&quot;<sup>35</sup></p>            <p class="second">Another early sponsor of <i>In Melbourne Tonight</i>               was Australian shoe manufacturer Raoul Merton. According to Newton,               the Raoul Merton commercials that he and Kennedy performed together               on the show &quot;changed the footwear buying habits for men.<sup>36</sup>               In his second book, Bert Newton: My Australia (1983), Newton recalled               the success of their first Raoul Merton commercial: &quot;The commercial               was meant to be a thirty seconder. We ad libbed it for twenty-seven               minutes, rubbishing the shoes, the price, and the company's managing               director Bill Muddyman, who was in a state of shock [...] until               next day when shoe shops all over Melbourne were calling urgently               for supplies of his shoes. A great ripple had been caused on the               lake of television when people suddenly realized that a twenty-seven-minute               commercial could become a vibrant part of a ninety-minute variety               show. I have no doubt that the Raoul Merton commercials have had               more impact on a television audience than any others in this country.<sup>37</sup></p>            <p class="second"><b>Behind the TV Cameras</b><br>              In the Australia of 1956 jobs behind the TV camera were considered               to be almost as glamorous as those in front of it. A number of advertisements               for men's clothes played on the perception that working behind-the-scenes               in television was a glamorous occupation. For example, a 1964 advertisement               for Sax Altmans, an Australian men's clothing manufacturer, showed               three men from the waist down who were all wearing Sax Altmans trousers               and working at a TV studio. The caption read: &quot;Do &pound;7/19/6<sup>38</sup>               slacks go with a TV Directorship and a &pound;10,000 penthouse -               Yes - when they are Sax Altmans. Leaders in the celebrity-studded               TV world have demanding tastes and a high price-tag is seldom a               deterrent when they buy. Yet in slacks they prefer Sax Altmans -               even to famous expensive importeds. Why? Because they want the best               fashion, fabrics, craftsmanship, comfort and they know Sax Altmans               have it. That Sax Altmans slacks cost no more than ordinary trousers               surprises them, certainly, but they find the surprise 'pleasant.'               SO WILL YOU.<sup>39</sup></p>            <p class="second">The Australian yarn manufacturer Patons published               the undated Patons Knitting Book 860 which featured several suave-looking               men working at a TV studio and wearing sweaters knitted with Totem,               one of its wool brands. The book explained that these were: &quot;Men,               at ease [...] catching up on a special fascination - the absorbing,               behind-the-scenes world of T.V. Playing at being television buffs.               Directing the show. Calling the cues. Applauding the performance.               And doing it all stylishly. Because style is the essence of Totem.<sup>40</sup></p>            <p class="second">The advertisements for Sax Altmans and the knitting               book by Patons saw the television industry in a light similar to               fast cars and power tools. They suggested that it was exclusive               and glamorous and that men in particular were fascinated by it.               They also implied that the kind of men who wore off-the-peg trousers               and hand-knitted sweaters were in charge of the television industry.               But most 'ordinary' men had no idea how the TV set in their living-room               worked, let alone how a TV show was put together.</p>            <p class="second"><b>TV Pyjamas</b><br>              During the late 1950s, in some circles it was quite fashionable               to wear pyjamas around the house. For example, a 1957 advertisement               for Australian-made Crystal pyjamas declared: &quot;Gad, what'll               they think of next? Time was when pyjamas were 'unmentionables'               and you'd have had a fit if caught in them. But suddenly it's 1957.               Pyjamas are not only respectable, but let's face it, even fashionable.               People do their housework in them, watch TV in them and -- inevitably               - go to parties in them.<sup>41</sup> Perhaps one reason for this was the popularity               of <i>The Pajama Game</i>, a U.S. musical comedy about love versus               trade union policy in a pyjama factory. It included several hit               songs in the play like 'Hey There' and 'Hernando's Hideaway.' In               Australia, the stage production of The Pajama Game, starring local               performers Toni Lamond and Bill Newman, premiered in Melbourne in               January 1957.<sup>42</sup> The Hollywood film version of <i>The Pajama Game</i>,               starring Doris Day and Broadway baritone John Rait, was released               in November of the same year.<sup>43</sup></p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                  <center>                    <a href="groves_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/groves_2a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                  </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="groves_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b> TV pyjamas: Bond's advertisement, The Australian Women's Weekly, 13 May 1959.</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Another reason why pyjamas were so popular in Australia               at this time was the introduction of television, fig. 2. Many people               liked to watch television dressed in their pyjamas, because they               felt comfortable. As with Heim's TV apron and Knights TV slippers,               television was largely responsible for elevating pyjamas from the               mundane to the (almost) glamorous. In 1956, Australian clothing               manufacturer Bond's began making 'Look-Alike' TV Pyjamas for mothers               and daughters with loose-fitting candy-striped jackets and plain               pants. In a 1956 advertisement, Betty Bond, the public face of Bond's,               declared: &quot;I wear my Bond's 'Look-Alike' pyjamas every night               I watch TV at home. Don't even mind when unexpected visitors call               because I feel quite dressed!<sup>44</sup></p>            <p class="second">Following Bond's lead, other Australian clothing               manufacturers also began producing women's TV pyjamas. For example,               in 1957, Kayser produced two styles of women's pyjamas &quot;designed               specially for sitting in front of the fire with a TV set.<sup>45</sup> One               had a short-sleeved jacket and long pants. The other style had a               jacket with three-quarter-length sleeves and pants cut below the               knees, closely resembling one of the TV outfits designed by Dena               of Leroy (described earlier). Perhaps the message was that TV pyjamas               were just as fashionable as daytime TV clothes, and daytime TV clothes               were just as comfortable as TV pyjamas.</p>            <p class="second">Initially, TV pyjamas were made only for females.               When males watched television dressed in pyjamas, they usually wore               a dressing-gown as well. One reason for this was that men's pyjama               pants had an open fly, and nobody wanted to 'flash' unintentionally.               Australian clothing manufacturer Onkaparinga made men's pure wool               dressing-gowns. A 1959 advertisement showed Onkaparinga's mascot,               a cute cartoon lamb, wearing a dressing-gown and watching television.<sup>46</sup>               In 1959, Bond's<sup>47</sup> and another Australian clothing company, Exacto,<sup>48</sup>               each began making TV pyjamas for fathers and sons. Now the whole               family could wear TV pyjamas. Furthermore, males could now wear               TV pyjamas without also wearing a dressing-gown since these pants               did not have a fly.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="groves_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/groves_3a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                  </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="groves_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> Style Knits by Patons, vol.17 (Melbourne: Patons and Baldwins (Australia)  Limited, n.d.)</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second"><b>Conclusion</b><br>              The introduction of television in Australia in 1956 influenced many               aspects of everyday life. Some of these were quite unexpected, such               as the design of women's and men's clothing, fig. 3. Television               clothes were meant to be both glamorous and serviceable - two largely               opposing concepts before the advent of television. This was true               regardless of whether the item of TV clothing was a fur coat or               a pair of slippers. Television also became the ultimate taste-maker.               TV shows like <i>A Woman with More Taste than Money</i>, began to               set fashion trends - once almost the exclusive domain of women's               fashion magazines. Furthermore, adults and children wanted to dress               like their favorite TV stars, which proved to be a windfall for               those astute clothing manufacturers who secured the likes of Graham               Kennedy to endorse their goods. In Australia, until about 1966,               almost anything associated with television was immediately assumed               to be exciting and new. On one hand, television was a great boost               for the fashion industry. On the other, the fashion industry helped               to legitimize watching television as a productive activity, especially               for women.</p>            <p class="second"><a href="groves_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="groves_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../gr/parthome.gif" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&copy;       2001 P<i>ART</i> and Derham Groves.
