The primordial               image that holds those recessions of the mind is that of the primitive               hut. The simple, one-room hut is architecture's first artifact:               the <i>aedicula</i>.

It is the place where the ideas and elements               of architecture combine to become a great event in the mind. It               is the place where we dwell, where we abide, and where we encounter               our selves. Its presence as a theme in the realm of architecture               has been persistent and powerful, as life affirming and life giving,               a place for living in. We delight in its firmness and commodity               as well as its permanence and our ease.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_1.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_1a.gif" width="120" height="179" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     1:</b> Douglas Darden; Family House, 1983; pencil, prismacolor,                     pastel, rubber cement on yellow trace, 7.8x11.5 inches.

The discussion               of the transactions which take place between site and program, nature               and culture, ideas and facts, image and reality, space and place,               order and chaos, technology and craft, and dwelling and building               exist as the central preoccupations and perpetual possibilities               of architecture.

And it talks to you!&quot;</i>               To build is to give life. It is to call forth a life and to embody               and instance it in the world. All things though, as the archetypal               psychologist James Hillman reminds us, have a shadow. In making               a building and thus making a life, one inevitably shapes the end               of that building, the end of that life. Within the compelling idea               of the first house - the house at the beginning of time - is buried               the equally compelling image of its shadow: the house at the end               of time. This is a place for dying in. Its fragility and hostility,               its ephemeral and temporary aspects, change our delight to anxiety,               our ease to dis-ease.</p>            <p class="second">In the essay <i>Inside Fear</i>, Anne Troutman describes               this 'other house':</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>I do not believe the house is a safe place.                 For me, it is a collision of dream, nightmare and circumstance:                 a portrait of an inner life. The primal shelter is also the site                 of primal fears. Its interiors are a map of the conscious and                 the unconscious: of their securities and insecurities. There is                 danger in the house. Closets, hallways, stairways, doors and windows,                 attics, basements, eaves and cabinets expand and contract with                 fear and desire. They are the night side of the house, in which                 the identity and security of domestic life is symbolically tested:                 they form another realm where daily life is displaced, condensed,                 fragmented. Within every contented home there resides the house                 that anxiety built and buried to counterbalance the security of                 the known self.<sup>1</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"><i>The House at the End of Time: Douglas Darden's               Oxygen House</i> is about that last house.

It is about the house that               anxiety designed, and buried. Instead of being concerned with a               house for living in, it deals with a house for dying in. And not               just a house for dying in, but a house for being buried in, entombed               in.

It is the archetypal last house. Douglas               Darden, a young and very talented architect, designed the house               for Burnden Abraham, a disabled signalman for the Southern Pacific               railroad, on a site near Frenchman's Bend in rural northern Mississippi.               The drawings were completed in 1998. Abraham died shortly after               the footings for the house were poured. The construction of the               house was abandoned. Oxygen House was not built, fig. 2.</p>            <p class="second">Burnden Abraham was confined to an oxygen tent because               of disabling chest injuries. Those injuries were caused by the derailment               of a Southern Pacific train on precisely the spot that was later               intended as the site for his house. The house he wanted was to be               his oxygen house: a shelter and setting that would sustain and support               his life. It was to be, quite literally, the place that 'held' his               breath and gave him life. He also asked that the house be transformed               into his sepulcher and his tomb at his death. This was to be a house               that would hold and mark the end of a history, Abraham's history.</p>            <p class="second">Following are discussions of the literary and figurative               origins of the project and the architectural tactics and instruments               used to order its composition. These enact, embody and instance               the 'soft' technologies that support and sustain the project's existence               as a work of architecture. In <i>The Question Concerning Technology</i>               Martin Heidegger develops two very careful interpretations of the               term techne and discusses two markedly different attitudes towards               technology itself. In the first, he links the words techne and poiesis,               and writes of technology's inherent purpose as that of revealing               things. In this case, technology serves to fashion and fabricate               revelations about the essential nature of things and show them forth.               In the second, he connects techne to episteme and discusses technology               as a means of challenging things. Here, technology confronts, opposes,               interrogates and subordinates the essential qualities of things.               The technologies that support the design and construction of Oxygen               House embody both attitudes. Therefore, the house functions as revelation               and as interrogation. Daedalus, architecture's mythic ancestor,               was accused of fashioning opera contra naturam, works contrary to               nature, works that challenged nature. Oxygen House fits within this               archaic tradition of architectural alchemy, but in the end uses               its architectural confrontations and challenges to carefully reveal               aspects of human nature and culture. It brings these to light, illumines               them, and honors them.</p>            <p class="second">Letters, notes, photographs, sketches, and final               drawings from the architect's archive are used in <i>The House at               the End of Time</i> to build an image of the house and its intentions.<sup>2</sup>               This is in a sense an exegesis: a careful reading and analysis of               the texts themselves. The role of the text was of paramount importance               in all of Douglas Darden's work. The essay presents the house using               the words of its architect, the voice of his client, and a range               of other images and texts that embody and support Oxygen House's               different constructions. Darden's words, images and texts used to               construct this essay are found in the O2 project file in the architect's               archive. They are organized under a series of headings that reflect               their genealogy: texts, pre-texts, con-texts, sub-texts, and archi-texts.               They will be presented in that order in this essay although they               do not necessarily appear in that order in his papers.</p>            <p class="second"><b>texts:</b></p>            <p class="second">This description of the house and the circumstances               leading to its design were found in the O2 project file. Between               1991 and 1995 Darden repeatedly published articles describing the               project. He also left copious notes about it. For example:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> <i>Oxygen House is perched on a depressed flood                 plain north-northwest of Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi. The structure                 is designed for Burnden Abraham, an ex-train signalman, who must                 live in an oxygen tent. In the early spring of 1979, after torrential                 rains, the railroad tracks on which Abraham worked were flooded.                 They were never fully repaired. That following summer during a                 routine operation, Abraham suffered a collapsed lung when a train                 jumped the track and sent metal debris puncturing his right lung.                 Three years later the railroad company put the property up for                 sale. Abraham purchased the plot where once he had worked. He                 requested that his house be built over the scene of his near-fatal                 accident. Abraham also requested that he finally be entombed in                 the house.<br>                The house is arranged as a near triptych comprised of an open-air                 blockhouse, a live-in nurse' station, and a drum-torso encircling                 an oxygen tent. The functions of the house are organized around                 three sets of lines which are drawn in relation to the derelict                 railroad tracks and a living willow tree.<sup>3</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_3a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen House, model, 1997; Digital                     Image by Peter Schneider, courtesy the Darden Estate</a></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The following letter was written by the client,               Burnden Abraham, and sent to the architect from Abraham's hospital               room in Byhalia, Mississippi. It records his thoughts about the               chosen site and his impending death:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>July 6, 1979<sup>4</sup><br>                Dear Mr. Darden:<br>                Today, my nurse, sister Jewel, and I went down from the hamlet,                 following the path as good as she could push me and my rolling                 chair. It was my third visit to the place where I was almost killed                 three years ago. Anyone watching us from the bluffs could have                 seen Jewel's straw-colored hair blowing more than a full head                 above my own in the dust.<br>                <br>                You can still see the faint depression of the wash baked brick-hard                 by the heat, which undermined the tracks. The tracks run straight                 as a plumb line, crossed by the wash. I can now look calmly at                 the break in the line. My chest no longer goes chuck chuck chuck.                 I am doing the right thing to purchase this plot for my house.<br>                <br>                Close to the break, in the center of the plain, is an old blockhouse.                 A path now circles the house at four soft right angles and goes                 on across the plain again. The blockhouse is square, with a broken                 roof set at a single pitch; it leans in empty dilapidation in                 the sunlight with a single broad window in two opposite walls                 giving onto the approaches of the tracks. You should have seen                 Jewel step through the window in a single stride while I took                 in the shimmering willow beyond.<br>                <br>                Jewel tells me that there once was a spring next to the willow.                 Even from the foot of the bluffs you can see its branches move                 as gracefully as Addie's curtains. Mostly all that is here is                 this tree, the tracks, and the sand.<br>                <br>                You have asked me to share with you my thoughts about death. Now                 is not the time for this. I have lived for too many months thinking                 in a fury that I had only a few days--sometimes only a few hours--to                 live. I was a bubble.<br>                <br>                I can only say that death no longer threatens me. It runs like                 soft gold between the shadow spaces, a diagonal vein passing through                 my life. Even though I hardly ever emerge from my tent, this vein                 gives me an enduring sense of sound movement, of amazement, and                 privilege. Let's go on and build the house.<sup>5</sup> (fig.                 3)</i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">At some point Abraham made a brief handwritten note               regarding death on an index card which is in the project file. It               quotes a short passage from Alexander Smith's book <i>Dreamthorp</i>.               The words and the thought he sent to his architect were:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>&quot;It is our knowledge that we have to die                 that makes us human.&quot;<sup>6</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Darden included his own ideas about about the project               in the O2 file. There are three typed documents that shed light               on his intentions for the project. They describe the <b>elements</b>               used to compose the house, the <b>instruments</b> that guided and               controlled the composition, and the <b>operations</b> that established               the program and ritual for the house.

They were the heralds of those               things that would emerge as he turned the problem over and became               engrossed in the dilemma of its origins. They were 'pre-' or that               which comes before, that which deals in the archaic, that which               deals with the shadowed regions out of which things come into their               light.</p>            <p class="second">There is also another sense, certainly undeclared,               in which the term pre-text was used in the Oxygen House project.               The dictionary definition of the word 'pretext' reads: '<i>pre&middot;text:               from prae- + texere to weave - 1513: a purpose or motive alleged;               or <u>an appearance assumed in order to cloak the real intention               or state of affairs</u></i>.' (my underline)</p>            <p class="second">Our word text has its roots in the idea of weaving               and in the construction of a fabric, a textile. It comes from a               Sanskrit root tekht meaning to weave. The tect in the word archi(tect)ure               comes from that same root, and establishes a connection between               the act of building, <i>tecton</i>, and that of weaving.<sup>7</sup>               One of the oldest creation stories in existence speaks of this connection               between the acts of building and weaving. It is Sumerian, and deals               with the time of the first appearance of all things. It reads:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>when on high the heavens had not yet been named,<br>                and the firm ground below had not been called by name<br>                when no hut had been matted and woven, <br>                when no marsh land had appeared,<br>                and no gods at all had been brought into being,<br>                then it was that the gods were formed within the waters.</i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">We still speak of the fabric of buildings, of buildings               as fabrics, and of fabricating things, affirming the bond between               our intertwined ideas of building and weaving. The compelling images               that come to mind such as the building clothed, the space wrapped,               the interior cloaked, the elements draped as if all were in an exquisitely               and perfectly woven cloth are an integral part of the making of               Oxygen House. They manifest themselves in its ideas, in its elements               and geometries, and in our experience of its disturbing 'life.'               This idea of the pre-text as a cloak in which secrets are wrapped,               in which meanings are hidden, in which truths are shrouded so evident               in this project, is a fundamental characteristic of all of Darden's               projects.</p>            <p class="second">The project files for Oxygen House hold a number               of drawn, handwritten and typed documents and diagrams that are               all labeled carefully as 'pre-texts.' They are the intertwined threads               out of which its validities and truths have been woven and fabricated.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_6.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_6a.jpg" width="120" height="160" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_6.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     6:</b> Douglas Darden; water tower, 1988; color negative in                     project file.

I wanted to use the building,                 to graft it, to turn it into something that was mine and into                 something which could reveal why I was attracted to it in the                 first place.<br>                <br>                As I said, the building sat alone on an open field. Even so, when                 I began to think about going inside, I became claustrophobic.                 This sensation haunted me as the opposite of my initial attraction.                 Here was this structure, which was from the outside one thing,                 and from the inside something entirely different. From the outside                 I felt free, open, and light; and inside, I felt a deep, dull                 pressure. The sensations were not unlike those I imagined I might                 feel if I had trouble, on occasion, breathing: as a man might                 feel if he had a collapsed lung.<br>                <br>                I began to wonder what would happen if a house no longer simple                 accommodated life, but was actually crucial for life's sustenance.                 It seemed to me then that the house would not only have to anticipate                 the longevity of the person living there, but it would also have                 to account for the inhabitants death. The house would be a sort                 of contest that could quite literally be described as the capacity                 to hold one's breath.

Abraham now lives in an oxygen tent.                 He is moderately ambulatory, but he cannot climb stairs. For most                 of his hours he is confined to a bed. In an interview I conducted                 with him in 1988 he told me that he sees death &quot;as a diagonal                 line, making its way progressively through my life.&quot; Everyday                 at least one friend, sometimes two, visit him in his tent.

In the service of this longevity                 the architect uses the timelessness of geometry to both enunciate                 and to camouflage the original arbitrariness of the timing of                 death. <br>                <br>                &quot;Oxygen House&quot; is consequently a contest of endurance                 initiated by geometry and waged by construction using temporal                 and transitory materials. The limits upon the existence of the                 architect's conception and design of the house emerge through                 the elaboration of two things: first, the positing of an enduring                 metaphor, the lungs, and second, the creation of a terminology                 of relationships which have a fidelity to the thing to which the                 original metaphor refers: the breath.<br>                <br>                The notion of &quot;house&quot; is thus a concentrated exercise                 in the context of the architect's breathing in a milieu of conventions:                 of limits. The house's center shifts to its periphery. It loses                 its place: its breath. It uses the value-laden terminology of                 architectural construction to an ironic end. The contest of endurance                 initiated by the geometry can be described literally as Burnden's                 - and the architect's - capacity to hold his breath in an atmosphere                 exhausted by codified volumes.<br>                <br>                The project is a concerted exercise in the control of breathing:                 of inhalation. The house is a bright illumination which is enclosing                 an opaque, shadowed tent: it allows for the expansion of darkness                 as a means to extend life. It straddles the gap between out and                 in.</i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"><b>pre-text 4:</b> the dis/continuous genealogy:               Douglas Darden's labyrinths for the imagination</p>            <p class="second">Douglas Darden's way of approaching this project               as well as all his projects constitutes a precise method, a mannered               practice. It exists as a personal and highly refined technology.               For Darden, each design project was an opportunity to encounter               architecture. While one could call what he did research in one sense,               the term 'insearch' that the psychologist James Hillman has coined               is perhaps much more appropriate. C.S. Lewis observed that we are               of two minds about things. One of those minds works in the realm               of reason and is in Lewis' words &quot;the organ of truth.&quot;               The other of those minds works in the domain of imagination, and               it is &quot;the organ of meaning.&quot; Research, as we commonly               understand it, is about discovering, uncovering, and articulating               truth. Insearch, on the other hand, is about encountering, unwrapping,               and assimilating meaning. And Darden's whole being was focused on               the task of unwrapping - untangling is perhaps a better term - architecture's               meanings and realities.</p>            <p class="second">He fervently took to heart the challenge that Martin               Buber articulated in one of his essays: <i>&quot;the only purpose               of the imagination is to imagine the real.&quot;</i> Imagining the               real became an exercise in (or is it of) forethought. For Darden               once the project had been made real, there were no afterthoughts.               Because of this, each and every element of a Darden project is essential               to the construction of the whole. One merely has to unravel its               role and purpose.</p>            <p class="second">Darden's work is marked by its relentless pursuit               of meaning. And his consistent and almost obsessive use of the tool               he invented, the dis/continuous genealogy, is the compass that sets               the directions for his architectural wanderings and imaginative               wonderings in search of meaning.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_7.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_7a.gif" width="120" height="169" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_7.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     7:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen House, dis/continuous genealogy,                     1988; ink on mylar, 14x44 inches.

When these are superposed, they become in a sense a               labyrinth for the mind. The labyrinth is a unique place in which               the imagination can wander/wonder to come upon, encounter and find               unexpected and/or surprising meanings. The genealogy becomes a tangle               of intentions, loose threads left by an attentive Ariadne that one               comes across, follows, and unravels to weave a new set of realizations               about architecture, and about life. Darden never separated the two               and believed that they could not be separated, fig. 7.</p>            <p class="second">He also never forgot that at the labyrinth's center               one always encountered the Minotaur. Through that encounter in the               heart of the labyrinth one must reckon with the difficult aspect               of the self. One is asked to confront and reconcile the tension               between self and other, between the cultured and the wild, between               existence and annihilation, between the known and the unknown, between               love and hate, between hope and despair and, always, between life               and death.</p>            <p class="second">The archetype of the labyrinth frames a lens through               which the intellectual and imaginative potentials of the project               beneath the project can be observed, magnified, studied and clarified.               Mircea Eliade talked about his own life as a series of encounters               with the labyrinth. In his words, a labyrinth is: <i>&quot;defense,               sometimes a magical defense, built to guard a center, a treasure,               a meaning. That symbolism is the model of all existence, which passes               through many ordeals in order to journey toward its own center,               toward itself, toward realization and insight. Once the center has               been reached we are enriched, our consciousness is broadened and               deepened, so that everything becomes clear and meaningful.&quot;</i><sup>9</sup>               The dis/continuous genealogy, as the specialized labyrinth Douglas               Darden fashioned for Oxygen House, was certainly that.</p>            <p class="second">The four components that in/formed the dis/continuous               genealogy for Oxygen House are exquisitely rendered ink-on-mylar               images of an airship or zeppelin. These are a Westinghouse brake               coupling; a pre-civil war tender used for inspecting and repairing               the railroad's tracks; and a signalman's water cooler and sink.               They are drawn individually, and are then rendered as a composite               drawing in which they are superposed, conflated, and combined. But,               it is not just the images that are being conflated. Each possesses               certain formal characteristics. Each carries carefully chosen ideas,               facts, and memories. And, each provokes a particular feeling and               emotion as one encounters and experiences its particular elements.               The superposition and conflation of these particular forms, ideas,               and experiences creates the dense and tangled web out of which the               project can be woven. They establish the dancing-floor on and through               which an Ariadne can weave her dance. She can find her way through               the labyrinth of the imagination to find the treasure at its center.               And leave a thread/s that one may follow her intricate path.</p>            <p class="second"><b>con-texts:</b></p>            <p class="second">The term context, or con-text as Douglas Darden               often writes it, can have a range of meanings. The entry for con-text,               as the dictionary defines it, reads: <i>Middle English, weaving               together of words; from Latin 'contextus,' connection of words;               from 'contexere,' to weave together; from com+texere, to weave:               the parts of a discourse that surround a word or passage and can               throw light on its meaning: the interrelated conditions in which               something exists or occurs.</i> Oxygen House clearly uses its con-texts               in this sense, as contrapuntal measures to the shadowed realms that               its pre-texts establish.</p>            <p class="second">The prefix 'con-' carries another conventional meaning:               against or contrary to. It is not used in this sense in the O2 project.               In many ways the con-texts exist to counteract the challenges and               confrontations that the project's architectural alchemies and 'soft'               technologies brought into play. It also, as a form of the prefix               'com-,' carries the meaning of with, together, jointly, and thoroughly.               It is clearly used in this sense in the project.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_8.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_8a.gif" width="120" height="147" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_8.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     8:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen House, pre-mortem section, 1988;                     pencil, graphite, white crayon, ink on Strathmore paper, 28x34                     inches.

In this sense con carries the               meaning to lead, to guide, to direct. The three con-texts that are               a part of the project file certainly do that. They were obviously               noted and carefully filed because they do just that, fig. 8.</p>            <p class="second">There are three photocopied con-texts that are clipped               to the front cover of the project file. The first is an excerpt               from a piece by Klaus Poenicke. Scrawled on a yellow post-it attached               to its reverse and written in red are the words: <i>Yes!

But with the triumph of western                 logocentrism, technological power and material affluence, we seem                 to have lost resilience in accommodating these anxieties.<sup>10</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The second is a copy of one page taken from Walt               Whitman's <i>Leaves of Grass</i> in the project file.

Another a hastily scrawled               note on a post-it stuck to the margin reads:<i> the antithesis of               these lines for house</i>.

All entry within the realm of dwelling moves                 across thresholds.

They were, for Darden, the primary               and original ideas which colored the project. James Hillman, the               archetypal psychologist, uses the Greek word <i>archai</i> often               in his essays and other writings. He uses the term carefully and               deliberately, writing that <i>'to the ancient greek philosophers,               archai are the basic elements out of which experience is made.</i>'</p>            <p class="second"><i>Archi</i> or <i>archai</i> is often translated               as chief or as first but it also carries the meaning of primordial,               or original, or basic. <i>Tectus</i>, from <i>tekht</i>, means to               build. It also means to weave. The <i>archi-tectus</i> may be seen               as the chief builder or master fabricator. That is the conventional               translation and interpretation of the word architect. But - and               it is a significant but - the <i>archai-tectus</i> can also be seen               as the weaver (<i>tecton</i>) of the basic elements (<i>archai</i>)               out of which our experience of our world is fabricated. This is               perhaps a more accurate rendering of the term than the first, conventional               interpretation. It is also, perhaps, in this second sense that we               should read and interpret all of Darden's archi-texts.

In Cocteau's words, &quot;each day in the mirror I watch                 death at work.&quot; The shortness of the moments of existence                 between birth and death are the inhalation: we live in the space                 between breaths: between their in and their out.<sup>14</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">There are two other short notes that deal with the               project itself:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>I believe that a work of literature can not                 only be a source of inspiration for an architectural project,                 but that a literary work can more directly in-form architecture:                 that is, a novel can be the veritable client for a building's                 design. This project will be derived from literature!<sup>15</sup><br>                <br>                The man (Abraham) has had his life shaken up and this suggested                 to me that, in his house, I could put into play - or perhaps risk                 - the systems that quietly give us peace in the normal world.<sup>16</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">In addition to these handwritten notes, there are               four images of the Hindenberg in the file that clearly speak to               the project in a range of ways. One is an archival photograph of               the airship at the instant of its destruction. It is a remarkable               picture, showing the airship as it explodes/implodes and loses its               air, loses its breath. The other three are images of the Hindenberg               in its hanger. One shows the Hindenberg without its cover, exposing               the airship's structural frame: its skeleton and 'rib cage.' Another               shows the Hindenberg 'clothed.' Its cover a taut skin that wraps               its delicate frame and contains its air, holds its breath. The last               image is one of the interior of the airship, with its cover loosely               draped within its skeletal frame just before the airship's finely               woven skin was wrapped tightly over the ribs of its steel cage.               The image is disquieting and disturbing. It reminds one of the folded               and 'draped' interior of a lung. It embodies the feeling held by               the words Darden used to describe the little industrial building               he encountered in that field outside Oxford with startling clarity:               <i>I became claustrophobic... I felt a deep, dull pressure...The               sensation was not unlike that I imagined I might feel if I had trouble,               on occasion breathing: as a man might feel if he had a collapsed               lung.</i></p>            <p class="second"><b>sub-texts:</b></p>            <p class="second">Douglas Darden talked frequently about his preoccupation               with exposing architecture's underbelly. He was not at all ashamed               of his obsession with those things that lay below the surfaces of               convention. The things that existed in the realm beneath the conscious,               in the Piranesi-like understories of architecture's secret, shadowed,               and hidden intentions. He used architecture to expose architecture:               to probe the project beneath the project, the program behind the               program, the building beneath/within the building. Each project               as a result had a set of clear sub-texts - the private stories beneath               the public tale. There are a range of documents in the project file               that illuminate this 'private' reading of the project and that unwrap               the dilemma of its origins. </p>            <p class="second"><b>sub-text 1:</b></p>            <p class="second">In 1994 Oxygen house was published in the literary               journal <i>Southern Quarterly</i>. Darden wrote a letter to the               editor on May 25, 1993, to place the project (and indeed all of               his work) within an intellectual context and an architectural agenda.               That context <i>'straddles the gap</i>' between architecture and               literature. In that letter, he discusses the connections between               literature and his work, and reveals the nature of the sub-text               that informed its intentions and design. He writes:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>This project displays my ongoing concern with                 architecture and its broader relationship to narrative space.                 Although I was &quot;formally trained&quot; as an architect, I                 have produced over the past ten years a number of theoretical                 projects which have been grounded in works of literature. One                 of my undergraduate degrees was in literature, and I continue                 to read avidly. More importantly, literature continues to create                 an agenda for representation which I deem to be pertinently as                 large as life. I want architecture to have that same agenda and                 literature has thus been my inspiration and, effectively, my sponsor.<br>                <br>                &quot;Oxygen House&quot; is an attempt to draw in architectural                 terms a parallel text from William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying.                 I have not sought to make a set of illustrations for Faulkner's                 novel, but, rather, I have endeavored to make a somewhat oblique                 equivalent to the story's effects in the configuration of architectural                 space. &quot;Oxygen House&quot; is at, once a meditation on the                 so-called death of the South and on the more general, deeply overlapping                 terrain of fact and fiction, the real and the invented. <br>                <br>                The impetus for the project came out of my attraction for literary                 maps. Specifically, I mean the kinds of maps drawn to accompany                 works of fiction, such as Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Ursula                 LeGuin's Earthsea trilogy, and, most of all, Faulkner's map of                 Yoknapatawpha County, in which so many of his novels' characters                 live. Faulkner's map impresses me the most for its ability to                 set up reverberations and adumbrations with today's South. Whether                 the map is real or not quickly flies from my concerns. It is carved                 out of a territory which is wholly true, and that is what matters.                 I have attempted to carve a similar territory through Oxygen House.<br>                <br>                The central character- client is a man named Burnden Abraham who                 is terminally ill. I had three concerns in designing the work                 of architecture. Firstly, I sought to design a house for a man                 who could not stand up, that is, for a man who had to live his                 life horizontally in bed: lying. [and dying.] Like Addie Bundren,                 Burnden Abraham is 'propped on the pillow, with her/his head raised                 so that she/he can see out of the window as her/his curtains move                 gracefully in the breeze.' <br>                <br>                Secondly, I wanted the house to convey the bittersweet balance                 between Abraham's life and his death: the house had to be his                 life-support system by which he would be completely dependent                 upon the architecture for his bodily existence, as well as eventually                 be his tomb.<br>                <br>                Lastly, I wanted a woman to act as a hinge for the man, mediating                 between his survival and his expiration. In Abraham's case, the                 space of the live-in nurse acts as a third element which binds                 his bedroom and burial place, functioning much like the gap we                 find between our own inhalations and exhalations. It is that gap,                 a pause, which signals the real possibility of breathing, and                 of its end.<sup>17</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"><b>sub-text 2:</b></p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_10.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_10a.jpg" width="226" height="100" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_10.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     10:</b> Douglas Darden; section of edited letter from Burnden                     Abraham, project file, 1988; carbon type, pencil, ink on white                     bond, 8.5x11 inches.

Burnden Abraham's               letter to his architect is one clear example of the simultaneity               that occurs between the texts. There are multiple copies of Abraham's               'letter' in the project file. One of those is a typed manuscript               literally covered with handwritten corrections. The text has been               extensively reworked, not just once, but over, and over, and over               again. Quite often the final version returns to its pure, original               and unchanged state. At other times, consistent changes are made               to adjust the text's meaning, and to redirect its flow. If one reads               the first chapter of <i>As I Lay Dying</i> carefully, and then reads               the letter attentively, one cannot help but be struck by the correspondences               and analogies that appear. Abraham's letter - or rather Abraham's               letter as Douglas Darden writes it - takes the first chapter of               Faulkner's novel, isolates, and subtly changes some of its phrases.               It then weaves them back together to fashion the text of the letter,               fig. 10.The underlined phrases in the letter's text as it appear               below show the fragments from Faulkner's original, and map their               re-weaving so that they can speak with the echoes of Abraham's voice,               and Abraham's heart, and Abraham's soul:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>Today, my nurse, sister <u>Jewel, and I went                 down from the hamlet, following the path</u> as good as she could                 push me and my rolling chair. It was my third visit to the place                 where I was almost killed three years ago. <u>Anyone watching                 us from the bluffs could have seen Jewel's straw-colored hair                 blowing more than a full head above my own in the dust.</u><br>                You can still see the faint depression of the <u>wash baked brick-hard                 by the heat</u>, which undermined the tracks. The tracks run <u>straight                 as a plumb line</u>, crossed by the wash. I can now look calmly                 at the break in the line. My chest no longer goes <u>chuck chuck                 chuck</u>. I am doing the right thing to purchase this plot for                 my house.<br>                Close to the break, <u>in the center of the plain, is an old blockhouse.                 A path now circles the house at four soft right angles and goes                 on across the plain again. The blockhouse is square, with a broken                 roof set at a single pitch; it leans in empty dilapidation in                 the sunlight with a single broad window in two opposite walls                 giving onto the approaches of the tracks. You should have seen                 Jewel step through the window in a single stride</u> while I took                 in the <u>shimmering willow</u> beyond. Jewel tells me that there                 once was a spring next to <u>the willow</u>. Even <u>from the                 foot of the bluffs</u> you can see its branches move as <u>gracefully                 as Addie's curtains</u>. Mostly all that is here is this tree,                 the tracks, and the sand.<br>                You have asked me to share with you my thoughts about death. Now                 is not the time for this. I have lived for too many months thinking                 in a fury that I had only a few days--sometimes only a few hours--to                 live. I was a bubble.<br>                I can only say that death no longer threatens me. <u>It runs like                 soft gold between the shadow spaces</u>, a diagonal vein passing                 through my life. Even though I hardly ever emerge from my tent,                 this vein gives me an enduring sense of sound movement, of amazement,                 and privilege. Let's go on and build the house.<sup>18</sup></i></p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"><b>sub-text 3:</b></p>            <p class="second">At the end of the first chapter of <i>As I Lay Dying</i>,               at the top of the bluff and directly above the spring and the willow,               Cash is standing in a litter of chips, fitting two boards together,               making a coffin for Addie Bundren. He is a good carpenter. Addie               Bundren could not want a better one, or a better box to lie in.               It will give her confidence and comfort. Abraham's house - the place               that holds his breath - is neither a mausoleum nor a tomb. The house               is in a very real sense Abraham's coffin, as finely wrought and               carefully crafted as Cash's box for Addie, where 'between the shadow               spaces it is bright as gold, like soft gold, bearing on its flanks               in smooth undulations the marks of its making.' It is a better box               to lie in, a better box to die in. It is one that gives him confidence               and comfort. It was always intended to be just that, as Burnden               Abraham lay abed, dying.</p>            <p class="second"><b>sub-text 4:</b></p>            <p class="second">There are seven copies of the map of Yoknapatawpha               County, Mississippi in the project file. There are three different               versions of the map, charting the evolution of the county in geography,               history and memory. Yoknapatawpha County is a fictional county.               It provides the fictive setting for a range of Faulkner's stories.               There is a note on all of the maps recording that William Faulkner               drew them. They appear as an appendix to <i>Absalom, Absalom</i>               and the different elaborations accompany the successive editions               of that work by William Faulkner. The three versions of the map               establish a clear 'text' that parallels the written word. They also               parallel the geography of Lafayette County in Mississippi, the 'real'               locus of Faulkner's world. Events from Faulkner's works appear on               the maps, which gives them a place and establishes their ground.</p>            <p class="second">The events that weave themselves through Addie Bundren's               saga in <i>As I Lay Dying</i> mark the final version of the map.               They locate Fisherman's Bend in its south and east corner of the               county, on the edge of the Yoknapatawpha River. It shows the run               of the railroad track, to the north and west of the hamlet of Fisherman's               Bend. It shows the bluffs that move from east to west across the               county and that establish the site for Oxygen House at the point               where they intersect with the north-south railroad tracks. It locates               the bridge that washed out in the flood, the site of the near loss               of Addie's coffin: the source of her confidence and comfort. That               washed-out bridge points to and foreshadows the washed-out railroad               track: the origin of Abraham's death. Faulkner's map also establishes               the major lines that are the precursors of the instruments that               structure Oxygen House. These are the horizontal, vertical, diagonal,               and rotational forces that establish its plan. Its center is also               marked by a disjunction in its major lines showing a break in their               continuity.

The map of               Yoknapatawpha County is printed on that not-quite-transparent page.               As one peers through that translucency, one cannot help but be struck               by the correspondence between the 'parti' of the plan (the organization               of its basic elements) and the structure of the roads, rivers and               railroad in Yoknapatawpha County. They are parallel diagrams. One               is confronted by a situation in which the ideas on which Oxygen               House is based parallel Faulkner's fictions, in which the diagram               of Oxygen House parallels Faulkner's fictional map, in which Faulkner's               map parallels Yoknapatawpha Faulkner's fictions, and in which the               structure that holds the Yoknapatawpha fictions parallels the fabric               of Faulkner's real world.

In Douglas Darden's world, things               are never quite as they first seem. There are always allusions,               and just as often there are carefully crafted illusions. What appears               to be an antithesis, what is labeled as antithetical can and often               does changes into synthesis. This is particularly true of the Whitman               excerpt. Darden's note to himself is apparently unequivocal: <i>the               antithesis of these lines for house</i>. That statement is perhaps               true of the house at its base, its basement. The opposite seems               to hold when one looks at the house's attic which is the level of               Abraham's bed and Abraham's world.</p>            <p class="second">The base of the house is a dark world. It is the               zone in which one confronts the blockhouse and its embedded tomb,               the nurses station, the threshold between Abraham's world and the               rest of creation, and the oxygen stack that is the source of Abraham's               breath, and his life and death. Its directions are downward and               inward, and it locates itself within the realm of the shadow. As               a closed underworld, a dark place, it is below the surface of the               land. It is the 'airless' place where one encounters the Minotaur.               It is where one confronts the disquieting, meets terror and anxiety,               and where one loses one's breath and comes upon the <i>'fear in               our stomachs that teaches us to build - to domesticate risk.' </i></p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="schnei_12.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/schnei_12a.jpg" width="250" height="70" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="schnei_12.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     12:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen House, Abraham's window on                     the world, 1988; black and white negative, project file.

He lies on his bed at the level of the original               delta. He rests, trans/figured, on the remade earth: growing in               the open air, eating and sleeping on and with the earth, his reconstituted               and sustaining 'ground.' It is a world that opens itself up to the               land, his land. He lays claim to the east and the west, the north               and the south. And, he gathers that land as he lies dying, <i>'propped               on the pillow, with his head raised so that he can see out of the               window as his curtains move gracefully in the breeze.'</i> Bound               to that land by his infirmity, he gathers its four horizons and               claims its four directions. Abraham lies dying/living in and on               his ground. He inhales great draughts of space, uplifted, resurrected,               redeemed and revealed. He is made good again, and lies/dies holding               his goodness, larger and better than he thought. It is a better               house to lie in, but, a better house to die in. Abraham, dead, is               buried and lies in his own ground. He finds rest in his in his well-crafted               box. Like Addie Bundren, he could not want a better one, a better               box to lie in. It gives comfort confidence and comfort, because               it held the secret of the making of the best persons <i>who grow               in the open air, and eat and sleep with the earth</i>, fig. 12.</p>            <p class="second"><b>sub-text 6:</b></p>            <p class="second">In the early pre-texts for the project there is               no Burnden Abraham. The client is called Mark Veritan. His story,               as it appears in the pre-texts, is identical to Abraham's story.               He is there in one text, gone the next. There is no record of how               he came into the narrative, nor one that tells why he left the project's               narrative as abruptly as he did. There is also no record of the               coming of Burnden Abraham into the architect's narrative. </p>            <p class="second">Burnden Abraham's coming is clearly no accident               and neither is the choice of that name. The persona is just too               well developed. Its links with the Faulkner tale are just too carefully               wrought for his coming to have been an afterthought. His arrival               and his character clearly constitute an intentional sub-text within               the intellectual and imaginative fabric of the project. Burnden               is quite obviously an anagram derived from Bundren. This is a sportive               play that weds the main characters in two stories: Faulkner's story               and Darden's tale. Making that link is easy. But why did Darden               choose the name Abraham? There are no parallel characters in <i>As               I Lay Dying</i>. The name Abraham does not appear in that work.               Nor does a character with the name Abraham assume any significant               role in any of the other works by Faulkner. So, whence Abraham?               And why?</p>            <p class="second">There are scriptural themes embedded in many of               Douglas Darden's projects. The use of the Whitman excerpt as a sub-text               in the text for Oxygen House puts a number of scriptural ideas and               references into play, as do a range of other ideas and elements               which are central to the project beneath the project, the program               behind the program. The ideas of revelation, redemption, transfiguration               and even resurrection implied by the Whitman piece make clear allusions               to scripture, as is the idea of holding so much goodness. The transformation               of the fabric of the oxygen tent into the shroud is pregnant with               scriptural connections, as is the use of the lift shaft with its               lidded cover - the constructed cave - as Abraham's tomb. The presence               of the tree in the blockhouse - the burial chamber/field - and its               proximity to the well-spring also points to scripture. The presence               of the willow that stands near the spring, biding its time, living,               dying and being brought back to new life each spring does as well.</p>            <p class="second"><i>'Oxygen House is,'</i> at one level and in Darden's               words, <i>' a meditation on the so-called death of the South.'</i>               It is also, quite inevitably, a meditation on the South's transformation,               transfiguration and redemption. Abraham, as the central character               in that meditation, is the metaphor that holds the story of his               dying land, the lost south. Just as Abraham, the great patriarch               in the Genesis narrative, held the story and the hope of his age:               the hope of the promised land. The stories in the two texts each               describe their Abraham and their Abraham's tomb in remarkably similar               ways. Each has a woman who 'acts as a hinge' in their lives. The               Abraham in Genesis has Sarah; the Abraham in Oxygen House has Jewel.<sup>19</sup>               Both Abraham's, as death drew near, established themselves in what               had been <i>'the land of their sojourning.'</i> Both '<i>placed</i>'               themselves by buying the land where they were to be buried. Each               was buried in a cave in a field, near a tree and a spring. And each               was buried, as scripture puts it, <i>'on his own ground.'</i> While               the Abraham of Genesis 'lay buried on his own ground,' the Abraham               who exists as the metaphor for the lost South<i> 'stood buried on               his own ground.</i>' He, as Douglas Darden no doubt intended it,               <i>'stood (and stands) <s>buried on</s> his <s>own</s> ground.'</i></p>            <p class="second"><b>epilogue: last things</b></p>            <p class="second">Oxygen House is an enormously rich and complex project,               as this tentative unwrapping of its 'soft' technologies has tried               to show. <i>'Its entire realm,'</i> to return to Bernd Jager's realization,               '<i>is intersected with curvatures, stops and starts, adaptations,               changes of mind, irregular weaving.' </i>It is a quilt, a tapestry,               a weaving. It is, as are all quilts, a complex text. It is an archai-text               that sets out to tell a range of intertwined tales, with interwoven               plots, that show forth the basic elements out of which all real               experience is made. Its 'official' texts are opaque, and cloak and               hide its elusive interiors. Rooms in which one encounters the reality               that has been brought into being by and through a profound imagination.</p>            <p class="second">Douglas Darden, the project's architect, died on               April 3, 1996. In a letter he wrote to an architect in Oxford, Mississippi               on July 20, 1991, but evidently never sent, he made the following               comment: </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><i>I must tell you that when I designed Oxygen                 House years ago I had no way of knowing how autobiographical the                 project would become&middot; I myself was diagnosed last year                 with a rare kind of leukemia that my doctors stubbornly and somewhat                 ruthlessly call 'terminal'&middot; It too, am stubborn and ruthless,                 but on the side of life.

I have no way of                 knowing for sure, but I believe now that when I designed Oxygen                 House my body KNEW that I had cancer. I was acting out my own                 difficult connection to that mysterious thing we call LIFE.

I thought that the project was operating purely                 outside myself, in the realm of art and ideas. I had no inkling                 that I had cancer, even though today, I am sure that it was present                 in my body when I designed the project.
