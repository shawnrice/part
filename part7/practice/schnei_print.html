It also deals with the archetypes         in and through which the images of those origins are brought once again         into the present. The primordial image that holds those recessions of         the mind is that of the primitive hut. The simple, one-room hut is architecture's         first artifact: the <i>aedicula</i>. The stories of its origin set up         architecture's enduring and central mythology.</p>      <p class="eighth">The first house is that mythology, the magical place where         the dreams of architecture meet the facts of nature and the circumstances         of culture. It is the place where the ideas and elements of architecture         combine to become a great event in the mind. It is the place where we         dwell, where we abide, and where we encounter our selves. Its presence         as a theme in the realm of architecture has been persistent and powerful,         as life affirming and life giving, a place for living in. We delight in         its firmness and commodity as well as its permanence and our ease.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_1a.gif" width="120" height="179" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 1:</b> Douglas Darden; Family               House, 1983; pencil, prismacolor, pastel, rubber cement on yellow               trace, 7.8x11.5 inches.

The discussion of the transactions         which take place between site and program, nature and culture, ideas and         facts, image and reality, space and place, order and chaos, technology         and craft, and dwelling and building exist as the central preoccupations         and perpetual possibilities of architecture. Included are its artifacts,         its ideology, its very profession and its complex internal life, fig.         1.</p>      <p class="eighth">Louis Kahn also commented that <i>&quot;when you make         a building, you make a life. And it talks to you!&quot;</i> To build is         to give life. It is to call forth a life and to embody and instance it         in the world. All things though, as the archetypal psychologist James         Hillman reminds us, have a shadow. In making a building and thus making         a life, one inevitably shapes the end of that building, the end of that         life. Within the compelling idea of the first house - the house at the         beginning of time - is buried the equally compelling image of its shadow:         the house at the end of time. This is a place for dying in. Its fragility         and hostility, its ephemeral and temporary aspects, change our delight         to anxiety, our ease to dis-ease.</p>      <p class="eighth">In the essay <i>Inside Fear</i>, Anne Troutman describes         this 'other house':</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>I do not believe the house is a safe place. For me,           it is a collision of dream, nightmare and circumstance: a portrait of           an inner life. The primal shelter is also the site of primal fears.           Its interiors are a map of the conscious and the unconscious: of their           securities and insecurities. There is danger in the house. Closets,           hallways, stairways, doors and windows, attics, basements, eaves and           cabinets expand and contract with fear and desire. They are the night           side of the house, in which the identity and security of domestic life           is symbolically tested: they form another realm where daily life is           displaced, condensed, fragmented. Within every contented home there           resides the house that anxiety built and buried to counterbalance the           security of the known self.<sup>1</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth"><i>The House at the End of Time: Douglas Darden's Oxygen         House</i> is about that last house. Instead of dealing with the pervasive         image of the house as 'home, sweet home,' it deals with the images found         in its shadow. It is about the house that anxiety designed, and buried.         Instead of being concerned with a house for living in, it deals with a         house for dying in. And not just a house for dying in, but a house for         being buried in, entombed in. In that house, the image of home is not         longer sweet, secure and comforting. It is dangerous, treacherous and         disquieting. It is 'home, wicked home.'</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_2a.gif" width="120" height="147" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, Oblige Elevation at Night, 1988; pencil, graphite, white               crayon, ink on Strathmore paper, 28x34 inches.

It is         a two-room house that is located at both the end of a time and at the         end of a history. It is the archetypal last house. Douglas Darden, a young         and very talented architect, designed the house for Burnden Abraham, a         disabled signalman for the Southern Pacific railroad, on a site near Frenchman's         Bend in rural northern Mississippi. The drawings were completed in 1998.         Abraham died shortly after the footings for the house were poured. The         construction of the house was abandoned. Oxygen House was not built, fig.         2.</p>      <p class="eighth">Burnden Abraham was confined to an oxygen tent because         of disabling chest injuries. Those injuries were caused by the derailment         of a Southern Pacific train on precisely the spot that was later intended         as the site for his house. The house he wanted was to be his oxygen house:         a shelter and setting that would sustain and support his life. It was         to be, quite literally, the place that 'held' his breath and gave him         life. He also asked that the house be transformed into his sepulcher and         his tomb at his death. This was to be a house that would hold and mark         the end of a history, Abraham's history.</p>      <p class="eighth">Following are discussions of the literary and figurative         origins of the project and the architectural tactics and instruments used         to order its composition. These enact, embody and instance the 'soft'         technologies that support and sustain the project's existence as a work         of architecture. In <i>The Question Concerning Technology</i> Martin Heidegger         develops two very careful interpretations of the term techne and discusses         two markedly different attitudes towards technology itself. In the first,         he links the words techne and poiesis, and writes of technology's inherent         purpose as that of revealing things. In this case, technology serves to         fashion and fabricate revelations about the essential nature of things         and show them forth. In the second, he connects techne to episteme and         discusses technology as a means of challenging things. Here, technology         confronts, opposes, interrogates and subordinates the essential qualities         of things. The technologies that support the design and construction of         Oxygen House embody both attitudes. Therefore, the house functions as         revelation and as interrogation. Daedalus, architecture's mythic ancestor,         was accused of fashioning opera contra naturam, works contrary to nature,         works that challenged nature. Oxygen House fits within this archaic tradition         of architectural alchemy, but in the end uses its architectural confrontations         and challenges to carefully reveal aspects of human nature and culture.         It brings these to light, illumines them, and honors them.</p>      <p class="eighth">Letters, notes, photographs, sketches, and final drawings         from the architect's archive are used in <i>The House at the End of Time</i>         to build an image of the house and its intentions.<sup>2</sup> This is         in a sense an exegesis: a careful reading and analysis of the texts themselves.         The role of the text was of paramount importance in all of Douglas Darden's         work. The essay presents the house using the words of its architect, the         voice of his client, and a range of other images and texts that embody         and support Oxygen House's different constructions. Darden's words, images         and texts used to construct this essay are found in the O2 project file         in the architect's archive. They are organized under a series of headings         that reflect their genealogy: texts, pre-texts, con-texts, sub-texts,         and archi-texts. They will be presented in that order in this essay although         they do not necessarily appear in that order in his papers.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>texts:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">This description of the house and the circumstances leading         to its design were found in the O2 project file. Between 1991 and 1995         Darden repeatedly published articles describing the project. He also left         copious notes about it. For example:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"> <i>Oxygen House is perched on a depressed flood plain           north-northwest of Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi. The structure is designed           for Burnden Abraham, an ex-train signalman, who must live in an oxygen           tent. In the early spring of 1979, after torrential rains, the railroad           tracks on which Abraham worked were flooded. They were never fully repaired.           That following summer during a routine operation, Abraham suffered a           collapsed lung when a train jumped the track and sent metal debris puncturing           his right lung. Three years later the railroad company put the property           up for sale. Abraham purchased the plot where once he had worked. He           requested that his house be built over the scene of his near-fatal accident.           Abraham also requested that he finally be entombed in the house.<br>          The house is arranged as a near triptych comprised of an open-air blockhouse,           a live-in nurse' station, and a drum-torso encircling an oxygen tent.           The functions of the house are organized around three sets of lines           which are drawn in relation to the derelict railroad tracks and a living           willow tree.<sup>3</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_3a.jpg" width="120" height="180" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, model, 1997; Digital Image by Peter Schneider, courtesy the               Darden Estate</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">The following letter was written by the client, Burnden         Abraham, and sent to the architect from Abraham's hospital room in Byhalia,         Mississippi. It records his thoughts about the chosen site and his impending         death:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>July 6, 1979<sup>4</sup><br>          Dear Mr. Darden:<br>          Today, my nurse, sister Jewel, and I went down from the hamlet, following           the path as good as she could push me and my rolling chair. It was my           third visit to the place where I was almost killed three years ago.           Anyone watching us from the bluffs could have seen Jewel's straw-colored           hair blowing more than a full head above my own in the dust.<br>          <br>          You can still see the faint depression of the wash baked brick-hard           by the heat, which undermined the tracks. The tracks run straight as           a plumb line, crossed by the wash. I can now look calmly at the break           in the line. My chest no longer goes chuck chuck chuck. I am doing the           right thing to purchase this plot for my house.<br>          <br>          Close to the break, in the center of the plain, is an old blockhouse.           A path now circles the house at four soft right angles and goes on across           the plain again. The blockhouse is square, with a broken roof set at           a single pitch; it leans in empty dilapidation in the sunlight with           a single broad window in two opposite walls giving onto the approaches           of the tracks. You should have seen Jewel step through the window in           a single stride while I took in the shimmering willow beyond.<br>          <br>          Jewel tells me that there once was a spring next to the willow. Even           from the foot of the bluffs you can see its branches move as gracefully           as Addie's curtains. Mostly all that is here is this tree, the tracks,           and the sand.<br>          <br>          You have asked me to share with you my thoughts about death. Now is           not the time for this. I have lived for too many months thinking in           a fury that I had only a few days--sometimes only a few hours--to live.           I was a bubble.<br>          <br>          I can only say that death no longer threatens me. It runs like soft           gold between the shadow spaces, a diagonal vein passing through my life.           Even though I hardly ever emerge from my tent, this vein gives me an           enduring sense of sound movement, of amazement, and privilege. Let's           go on and build the house.<sup>5</sup> (fig. 3)</i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">At some point Abraham made a brief handwritten note regarding         death on an index card which is in the project file. It quotes a short         passage from Alexander Smith's book <i>Dreamthorp</i>. The words and the         thought he sent to his architect were:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>&quot;It is our knowledge that we have to die that           makes us human.&quot;<sup>6</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">Darden included his own ideas about about the project         in the O2 file. There are three typed documents that shed light on his         intentions for the project. They describe the <b>elements</b> used to         compose the house, the <b>instruments</b> that guided and controlled the         composition, and the <b>operations</b> that established the program and         ritual for the house.

He used         the hyphen quite deliberately to indicate that these texts were the portents         of things to come. They were the heralds of those things that would emerge         as he turned the problem over and became engrossed in the dilemma of its         origins. They were 'pre-' or that which comes before, that which deals         in the archaic, that which deals with the shadowed regions out of which         things come into their light.</p>      <p class="eighth">There is also another sense, certainly undeclared, in         which the term pre-text was used in the Oxygen House project. The dictionary         definition of the word 'pretext' reads: '<i>pre&middot;text: from prae-         + texere to weave - 1513: a purpose or motive alleged; or <u>an appearance         assumed in order to cloak the real intention or state of affairs</u></i>.'         (my underline)</p>      <p class="eighth">Our word text has its roots in the idea of weaving and         in the construction of a fabric, a textile. It comes from a Sanskrit root         tekht meaning to weave. The tect in the word archi(tect)ure comes from         that same root, and establishes a connection between the act of building,         <i>tecton</i>, and that of weaving.<sup>7</sup> One of the oldest creation         stories in existence speaks of this connection between the acts of building         and weaving. It is Sumerian, and deals with the time of the first appearance         of all things. It reads:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>when on high the heavens had not yet been named,<br>          and the firm ground below had not been called by name<br>          when no hut had been matted and woven, <br>          when no marsh land had appeared,<br>          and no gods at all had been brought into being,<br>          then it was that the gods were formed within the waters.</i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">We still speak of the fabric of buildings, of buildings         as fabrics, and of fabricating things, affirming the bond between our         intertwined ideas of building and weaving. The compelling images that         come to mind such as the building clothed, the space wrapped, the interior         cloaked, the elements draped as if all were in an exquisitely and perfectly         woven cloth are an integral part of the making of Oxygen House.

I wanted to use the building, to graft           it, to turn it into something that was mine and into something which           could reveal why I was attracted to it in the first place.<br>          <br>          As I said, the building sat alone on an open field. Even so, when I           began to think about going inside, I became claustrophobic. This sensation           haunted me as the opposite of my initial attraction. Here was this structure,           which was from the outside one thing, and from the inside something           entirely different. From the outside I felt free, open, and light; and           inside, I felt a deep, dull pressure. The sensations were not unlike           those I imagined I might feel if I had trouble, on occasion, breathing:           as a man might feel if he had a collapsed lung.<br>          <br>          I began to wonder what would happen if a house no longer simple accommodated           life, but was actually crucial for life's sustenance. It seemed to me           then that the house would not only have to anticipate the longevity           of the person living there, but it would also have to account for the           inhabitants death. The house would be a sort of contest that could quite           literally be described as the capacity to hold one's breath.

Abraham now lives in an oxygen tent. He is moderately ambulatory,           but he cannot climb stairs. For most of his hours he is confined to           a bed. In an interview I conducted with him in 1988 he told me that           he sees death &quot;as a diagonal line, making its way progressively           through my life.&quot; Everyday at least one friend, sometimes two,           visit him in his tent.

The limits upon the existence of the architect's conception           and design of the house emerge through the elaboration of two things:           first, the positing of an enduring metaphor, the lungs, and second,           the creation of a terminology of relationships which have a fidelity           to the thing to which the original metaphor refers: the breath.<br>          <br>          The notion of &quot;house&quot; is thus a concentrated exercise in the           context of the architect's breathing in a milieu of conventions: of           limits. The house's center shifts to its periphery. It loses its place:           its breath. It uses the value-laden terminology of architectural construction           to an ironic end. The contest of endurance initiated by the geometry           can be described literally as Burnden's - and the architect's - capacity           to hold his breath in an atmosphere exhausted by codified volumes.<br>          <br>          The project is a concerted exercise in the control of breathing: of           inhalation.

For Darden, each         design project was an opportunity to encounter architecture. While one         could call what he did research in one sense, the term 'insearch' that         the psychologist James Hillman has coined is perhaps much more appropriate.         C.S. Lewis observed that we are of two minds about things. One of those         minds works in the realm of reason and is in Lewis' words &quot;the organ         of truth.&quot; The other of those minds works in the domain of imagination,         and it is &quot;the organ of meaning.&quot; Research, as we commonly understand         it, is about discovering, uncovering, and articulating truth. Insearch,         on the other hand, is about encountering, unwrapping, and assimilating         meaning. And Darden's whole being was focused on the task of unwrapping         - untangling is perhaps a better term - architecture's meanings and realities.</p>      <p class="eighth">He fervently took to heart the challenge that Martin Buber         articulated in one of his essays: <i>&quot;the only purpose of the imagination         is to imagine the real.&quot;</i> Imagining the real became an exercise         in (or is it of) forethought. For Darden once the project had been made         real, there were no afterthoughts. Because of this, each and every element         of a Darden project is essential to the construction of the whole. One         merely has to unravel its role and purpose.</p>      <p class="eighth">Darden's work is marked by its relentless pursuit of meaning.         And his consistent and almost obsessive use of the tool he invented, the         dis/continuous genealogy, is the compass that sets the directions for         his architectural wanderings and imaginative wonderings in search of meaning.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_7a.gif" width="120" height="169" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 7:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, dis/continuous genealogy, 1988; ink on mylar, 14x44 inches.               Digital Image by Peter Schneider, courtesy the Darden Estate</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">The dis/continuous genealogy is a superposition of a set         of images, each of which holds and carries its own world of meaning. When         these are superposed, they become in a sense a labyrinth for the mind.         The labyrinth is a unique place in which the imagination can wander/wonder         to come upon, encounter and find unexpected and/or surprising meanings.         The genealogy becomes a tangle of intentions, loose threads left by an         attentive Ariadne that one comes across, follows, and unravels to weave         a new set of realizations about architecture, and about life. Darden never         separated the two and believed that they could not be separated, fig.         7.</p>      <p class="eighth">He also never forgot that at the labyrinth's center one         always encountered the Minotaur. Through that encounter in the heart of         the labyrinth one must reckon with the difficult aspect of the self. One         is asked to confront and reconcile the tension between self and other,         between the cultured and the wild, between existence and annihilation,         between the known and the unknown, between love and hate, between hope         and despair and, always, between life and death.</p>      <p class="eighth">The archetype of the labyrinth frames a lens through which         the intellectual and imaginative potentials of the project beneath the         project can be observed, magnified, studied and clarified. Mircea Eliade         talked about his own life as a series of encounters with the labyrinth.         In his words, a labyrinth is: <i>&quot;defense, sometimes a magical defense,         built to guard a center, a treasure, a meaning. That symbolism is the         model of all existence, which passes through many ordeals in order to         journey toward its own center, toward itself, toward realization and insight.         Once the center has been reached we are enriched, our consciousness is         broadened and deepened, so that everything becomes clear and meaningful.&quot;</i><sup>9</sup>         The dis/continuous genealogy, as the specialized labyrinth Douglas Darden         fashioned for Oxygen House, was certainly that.</p>      <p class="eighth">The four components that in/formed the dis/continuous         genealogy for Oxygen House are exquisitely rendered ink-on-mylar images         of an airship or zeppelin. These are a Westinghouse brake coupling; a         pre-civil war tender used for inspecting and repairing the railroad's         tracks; and a signalman's water cooler and sink. They are drawn individually,         and are then rendered as a composite drawing in which they are superposed,         conflated, and combined. But, it is not just the images that are being         conflated. Each possesses certain formal characteristics. Each carries         carefully chosen ideas, facts, and memories. And, each provokes a particular         feeling and emotion as one encounters and experiences its particular elements.         The superposition and conflation of these particular forms, ideas, and         experiences creates the dense and tangled web out of which the project         can be woven. They establish the dancing-floor on and through which an         Ariadne can weave her dance. She can find her way through the labyrinth         of the imagination to find the treasure at its center. And leave a thread/s         that one may follow her intricate path.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>con-texts:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">The term context, or con-text as Douglas Darden often         writes it, can have a range of meanings. The entry for con-text, as the         dictionary defines it, reads: <i>Middle English, weaving together of words;         from Latin 'contextus,' connection of words; from 'contexere,' to weave         together; from com+texere, to weave: the parts of a discourse that surround         a word or passage and can throw light on its meaning: the interrelated         conditions in which something exists or occurs.</i> Oxygen House clearly         uses its con-texts in this sense, as contrapuntal measures to the shadowed         realms that its pre-texts establish.</p>      <p class="eighth">The prefix 'con-' carries another conventional meaning:         against or contrary to. It is not used in this sense in the O2 project.         In many ways the con-texts exist to counteract the challenges and confrontations         that the project's architectural alchemies and 'soft' technologies brought         into play. It also, as a form of the prefix 'com-,' carries the meaning         of with, together, jointly, and thoroughly. It is clearly used in this         sense in the project.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_8a.gif" width="120" height="147" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 8:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, pre-mortem section, 1988; pencil, graphite, white crayon,               ink on Strathmore paper, 28x34 inches.

In this sense con carries the meaning to lead, to guide, to direct.         The three con-texts that are a part of the project file certainly do that.         They were obviously noted and carefully filed because they do just that,         fig. 8.</p>      <p class="eighth">There are three photocopied con-texts that are clipped         to the front cover of the project file. The first is an excerpt from a         piece by Klaus Poenicke. Scrawled on a yellow post-it attached to its         reverse and written in red are the words: <i>Yes! Use this!</i></p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>We are still frail and vulnerable creatures, bound           in the prison of our bodies, subject to infirmity, pain and the inexorable           rule of time. It is the body which, as a system of openness and high           'imbalance', sustaining a living interchange with its ever-fluctuating,           so-called 'environment,' perpetually produces feelings of anxiety. But           with the triumph of western logocentrism, technological power and material           affluence, we seem to have lost resilience in accommodating these anxieties.<sup>10</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">The second is a copy of one page taken from Walt Whitman's         <i>Leaves of Grass</i> in the project file. Two disconnected sections         of the poem, nine lines, in the section titled <i>Song of the Road</i>         are marked and underlined. Another a hastily scrawled note on a post-it         stuck to the margin reads:<i> the antithesis of these lines for house</i>.         The lines that are apparently singularly antithetical to the architect's         position read:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"> <i>I inhale great draughts of space,<br>          the east and west are mine,<br>          and the north and south are mine.<br>          I am larger, better than I thought,<br>          I did not know I held so much goodness.<br>          Now I see the secret <br>          of the making of the best persons, <br>          it is to grow in the open air <br>          and to eat and sleep with the earth.<sup>11</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">The final con-text is a short selection from an essay         by the psychologist Bernd Jager:</p>      <blockquote>        <p class="second"><i>Dwelling places the landscape within the tension           of an inside and an outside, of intimacy and alienation, of admission           and rejection. Prior to our capacity to build there lies embedded in           out flesh, as a sign of what is to come, the thresholds which portent           of dwelling. The realm of dwelling is one of discontinuity, a world           of thresholds requiring the interruption of a fall, the breaking of           a straight line. The entire realm is intersected with curvatures, stops           and starts, adaptations, changes of mind, irregular weavings: quilts.           All entry within the realm of dwelling moves across thresholds. And           all crossings of the threshold, all commitments, require a sacrifice:           a death in life.</i><sup>12</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">These three excerpts establish the interrelated conditions,         the con-texts, within which the project occurs and finds its validity.         They are there to teach and to guide, to test and direct. They establish         the cartography of the projects intentions and fix the intellectual and         emotional directions of the project. The directions that bind the north         and the south, east and the west, that are powerful portents of Abraham's         dwelling.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>archi-texts:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">Douglas Darden often labeled some thought that came to         him and was subsequently written down on a sheet of trace or scrap of         paper as an archi-text. They were, for Darden, the primary and original         ideas which colored the project. James Hillman, the archetypal psychologist,         uses the Greek word <i>archai</i> often in his essays and other writings.         He uses the term carefully and deliberately, writing that <i>'to the ancient         greek philosophers, archai are the basic elements out of which experience         is made.</i>'</p>      <p class="eighth"><i>Archi</i> or <i>archai</i> is often translated as chief         or as first but it also carries the meaning of primordial, or original,         or basic. <i>Tectus</i>, from <i>tekht</i>, means to build. It also means         to weave. The <i>archi-tectus</i> may be seen as the chief builder or         master fabricator. That is the conventional translation and interpretation         of the word architect. But - and it is a significant but - the <i>archai-tectus</i>         can also be seen as the weaver (<i>tecton</i>) of the basic elements (<i>archai</i>)         out of which our experience of our world is fabricated. This is perhaps         a more accurate rendering of the term than the first, conventional interpretation.         It is also, perhaps, in this second sense that we should read and interpret         all of Darden's archi-texts. They constitute the basic elements out of         which our experience of the project and its world are made.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_9a.gif" width="120" height="147" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 9:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, elevation from south, 1988; pencil, graphite, white crayon,               ink on Strathmore paper, 28x34 inches.

Two         of those record Darden's reflections and realizations on the subject of         death and its relation to architecture and the project. The first one,         undated, reads:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>It is a fear in our stomachs that teaches us to build.<br>          To build shelter to absolve and dissolve our fear,<br>          and to domesticate risk.</i></p>        <p class="eighth"><i>What if the systems through which we build were reversed           and put at risk,<br>          so that the work of architecture returned us to that fear, to that anxiety,and           had us see it in a new way.</i></p>        <p class="eighth"><i>A way which reconstituted the fear and also gave           it a breath: a life.</i></p>        <p><i><span class="eighth">That life would, by necessity, have to incorporate           its own perennial death.<sup>13</sup> (fig. 9)</span></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">The second, again undated, reads: </p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>Death works its way through our lives on a diagonal           line; it rarely plunges as abruptly as a vertical loss or a horizontal           equivalence. Death, in other words, permeates life: we straddle it and           we feel the shadow of life passing all the time. In Cocteau's words,           &quot;each day in the mirror I watch death at work.&quot; The shortness           of the moments of existence between birth and death are the inhalation:           we live in the space between breaths: between their in and their out.<sup>14</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">There are two other short notes that deal with the project         itself:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>I believe that a work of literature can not only           be a source of inspiration for an architectural project, but that a           literary work can more directly in-form architecture: that is, a novel           can be the veritable client for a building's design.

One is an archival photograph of the airship at the         instant of its destruction. It is a remarkable picture, showing the airship         as it explodes/implodes and loses its air, loses its breath. The other         three are images of the Hindenberg in its hanger. One shows the Hindenberg         without its cover, exposing the airship's structural frame: its skeleton         and 'rib cage.' Another shows the Hindenberg 'clothed.' Its cover a taut         skin that wraps its delicate frame and contains its air, holds its breath.         The last image is one of the interior of the airship, with its cover loosely         draped within its skeletal frame just before the airship's finely woven         skin was wrapped tightly over the ribs of its steel cage. The image is         disquieting and disturbing. It reminds one of the folded and 'draped'         interior of a lung. It embodies the feeling held by the words Darden used         to describe the little industrial building he encountered in that field         outside Oxford with startling clarity: <i>I became claustrophobic... I         felt a deep, dull pressure...The sensation was not unlike that I imagined         I might feel if I had trouble, on occasion breathing: as a man might feel         if he had a collapsed lung.</i></p>      <p class="eighth"><b>sub-texts:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">Douglas Darden talked frequently about his preoccupation         with exposing architecture's underbelly. He was not at all ashamed of         his obsession with those things that lay below the surfaces of convention.         The things that existed in the realm beneath the conscious, in the Piranesi-like         understories of architecture's secret, shadowed, and hidden intentions.         He used architecture to expose architecture: to probe the project beneath         the project, the program behind the program, the building beneath/within         the building. Each project as a result had a set of clear sub-texts -         the private stories beneath the public tale. There are a range of documents         in the project file that illuminate this 'private' reading of the project         and that unwrap the dilemma of its origins. </p>      <p class="eighth"><b>sub-text 1:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">In 1994 Oxygen house was published in the literary journal         <i>Southern Quarterly</i>. Darden wrote a letter to the editor on May         25, 1993, to place the project (and indeed all of his work) within an         intellectual context and an architectural agenda. That context <i>'straddles         the gap</i>' between architecture and literature. In that letter, he discusses         the connections between literature and his work, and reveals the nature         of the sub-text that informed its intentions and design. He writes:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>This project displays my ongoing concern with architecture           and its broader relationship to narrative space. Although I was &quot;formally           trained&quot; as an architect, I have produced over the past ten years           a number of theoretical projects which have been grounded in works of           literature. One of my undergraduate degrees was in literature, and I           continue to read avidly. More importantly, literature continues to create           an agenda for representation which I deem to be pertinently as large           as life. I want architecture to have that same agenda and literature           has thus been my inspiration and, effectively, my sponsor.<br>          <br>          &quot;Oxygen House&quot; is an attempt to draw in architectural terms           a parallel text from William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. I have not sought           to make a set of illustrations for Faulkner's novel, but, rather, I           have endeavored to make a somewhat oblique equivalent to the story's           effects in the configuration of architectural space. &quot;Oxygen House&quot;           is at, once a meditation on the so-called death of the South and on           the more general, deeply overlapping terrain of fact and fiction, the           real and the invented. <br>          <br>          The impetus for the project came out of my attraction for literary maps.           Specifically, I mean the kinds of maps drawn to accompany works of fiction,           such as Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea trilogy,           and, most of all, Faulkner's map of Yoknapatawpha County, in which so           many of his novels' characters live. Faulkner's map impresses me the           most for its ability to set up reverberations and adumbrations with           today's South. Whether the map is real or not quickly flies from my           concerns. It is carved out of a territory which is wholly true, and           that is what matters. I have attempted to carve a similar territory           through Oxygen House.<br>          <br>          The central character- client is a man named Burnden Abraham who is           terminally ill. I had three concerns in designing the work of architecture.           Firstly, I sought to design a house for a man who could not stand up,           that is, for a man who had to live his life horizontally in bed: lying.           [and dying.] Like Addie Bundren, Burnden Abraham is 'propped on the           pillow, with her/his head raised so that she/he can see out of the window           as her/his curtains move gracefully in the breeze.' <br>          <br>          Secondly, I wanted the house to convey the bittersweet balance between           Abraham's life and his death: the house had to be his life-support system           by which he would be completely dependent upon the architecture for           his bodily existence, as well as eventually be his tomb.<br>          <br>          Lastly, I wanted a woman to act as a hinge for the man, mediating between           his survival and his expiration. In Abraham's case, the space of the           live-in nurse acts as a third element which binds his bedroom and burial           place, functioning much like the gap we find between our own inhalations           and exhalations. It is that gap, a pause, which signals the real possibility           of breathing, and of its end.<sup>17</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth"><b>sub-text 2:</b></p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_10a.jpg" width="226" height="100" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 10:</b> Douglas Darden; section               of edited letter from Burnden Abraham, project file, 1988; carbon               type, pencil, ink on white bond, 8.5x11 inches.

Burnden Abraham's letter to his         architect is one clear example of the simultaneity that occurs between         the texts. There are multiple copies of Abraham's 'letter' in the project         file. One of those is a typed manuscript literally covered with handwritten         corrections. The text has been extensively reworked, not just once, but         over, and over, and over again. Quite often the final version returns         to its pure, original and unchanged state. At other times, consistent         changes are made to adjust the text's meaning, and to redirect its flow.         If one reads the first chapter of <i>As I Lay Dying</i> carefully, and         then reads the letter attentively, one cannot help but be struck by the         correspondences and analogies that appear. Abraham's letter - or rather         Abraham's letter as Douglas Darden writes it - takes the first chapter         of Faulkner's novel, isolates, and subtly changes some of its phrases.         It then weaves them back together to fashion the text of the letter, fig.         10.The underlined phrases in the letter's text as it appear below show         the fragments from Faulkner's original, and map their re-weaving so that         they can speak with the echoes of Abraham's voice, and Abraham's heart,         and Abraham's soul:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>Today, my nurse, sister <u>Jewel, and I went down           from the hamlet, following the path</u> as good as she could push me           and my rolling chair. It was my third visit to the place where I was           almost killed three years ago. <u>Anyone watching us from the bluffs           could have seen Jewel's straw-colored hair blowing more than a full           head above my own in the dust.</u><br>          You can still see the faint depression of the <u>wash baked brick-hard           by the heat</u>, which undermined the tracks. The tracks run <u>straight           as a plumb line</u>, crossed by the wash. I can now look calmly at the           break in the line.

The blockhouse is square, with a broken roof set at           a single pitch; it leans in empty dilapidation in the sunlight with           a single broad window in two opposite walls giving onto the approaches           of the tracks. You should have seen Jewel step through the window in           a single stride</u> while I took in the <u>shimmering willow</u> beyond.           Jewel tells me that there once was a spring next to <u>the willow</u>.           Even <u>from the foot of the bluffs</u> you can see its branches move           as <u>gracefully as Addie's curtains</u>. Mostly all that is here is           this tree, the tracks, and the sand.<br>          You have asked me to share with you my thoughts about death. Now is           not the time for this. I have lived for too many months thinking in           a fury that I had only a few days--sometimes only a few hours--to live.           I was a bubble.<br>          I can only say that death no longer threatens me. <u>It runs like soft           gold between the shadow spaces</u>, a diagonal vein passing through           my life. Even though I hardly ever emerge from my tent, this vein gives           me an enduring sense of sound movement, of amazement, and privilege.           Let's go on and build the house.<sup>18</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth"><b>sub-text 3:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">At the end of the first chapter of <i>As I Lay Dying</i>,         at the top of the bluff and directly above the spring and the willow,         Cash is standing in a litter of chips, fitting two boards together, making         a coffin for Addie Bundren. He is a good carpenter. Addie Bundren could         not want a better one, or a better box to lie in. It will give her confidence         and comfort. Abraham's house - the place that holds his breath - is neither         a mausoleum nor a tomb. The house is in a very real sense Abraham's coffin,         as finely wrought and carefully crafted as Cash's box for Addie, where         'between the shadow spaces it is bright as gold, like soft gold, bearing         on its flanks in smooth undulations the marks of its making.' It is a         better box to lie in, a better box to die in. It is one that gives him         confidence and comfort. It was always intended to be just that, as Burnden         Abraham lay abed, dying.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>sub-text 4:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">There are seven copies of the map of Yoknapatawpha County,         Mississippi in the project file. There are three different versions of         the map, charting the evolution of the county in geography, history and         memory. Yoknapatawpha County is a fictional county. It provides the fictive         setting for a range of Faulkner's stories. There is a note on all of the         maps recording that William Faulkner drew them. They appear as an appendix         to <i>Absalom, Absalom</i> and the different elaborations accompany the         successive editions of that work by William Faulkner. The three versions         of the map establish a clear 'text' that parallels the written word. They         also parallel the geography of Lafayette County in Mississippi, the 'real'         locus of Faulkner's world. Events from Faulkner's works appear on the         maps, which gives them a place and establishes their ground.</p>      <p class="eighth">The events that weave themselves through Addie Bundren's         saga in <i>As I Lay Dying</i> mark the final version of the map. They         locate Fisherman's Bend in its south and east corner of the county, on         the edge of the Yoknapatawpha River. It shows the run of the railroad         track, to the north and west of the hamlet of Fisherman's Bend. It shows         the bluffs that move from east to west across the county and that establish         the site for Oxygen House at the point where they intersect with the north-south         railroad tracks. It locates the bridge that washed out in the flood, the         site of the near loss of Addie's coffin: the source of her confidence         and comfort. That washed-out bridge points to and foreshadows the washed-out         railroad track: the origin of Abraham's death. Faulkner's map also establishes         the major lines that are the precursors of the instruments that structure         Oxygen House. These are the horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and rotational         forces that establish its plan. Its center is also marked by a disjunction         in its major lines showing a break in their continuity. That disjunction         prefigures the break in the tracks that lie at the center of the diagram         of Darden's Oxygen House and that prefigures Abraham's tragedy in the         course of his life and death.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_11a.gif" width="120" height="147" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 11:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, plan at delta level, 1988; pencil, graphite, white crayon,               ink on Strathmore paper, 28x34 inches.

One is confronted by a situation in which         the ideas on which Oxygen House is based parallel Faulkner's fictions,         in which the diagram of Oxygen House parallels Faulkner's fictional map,         in which Faulkner's map parallels Yoknapatawpha Faulkner's fictions, and         in which the structure that holds the Yoknapatawpha fictions parallels         the fabric of Faulkner's real world.

In Douglas Darden's world, things are         never quite as they first seem. There are always allusions, and just as         often there are carefully crafted illusions. What appears to be an antithesis,         what is labeled as antithetical can and often does changes into synthesis.         This is particularly true of the Whitman excerpt. Darden's note to himself         is apparently unequivocal: <i>the antithesis of these lines for house</i>.         That statement is perhaps true of the house at its base, its basement.         The opposite seems to hold when one looks at the house's attic which is         the level of Abraham's bed and Abraham's world.</p>      <p class="eighth">The base of the house is a dark world. It is the zone         in which one confronts the blockhouse and its embedded tomb, the nurses         station, the threshold between Abraham's world and the rest of creation,         and the oxygen stack that is the source of Abraham's breath, and his life         and death. Its directions are downward and inward, and it locates itself         within the realm of the shadow. As a closed underworld, a dark place,         it is below the surface of the land. It is the 'airless' place where one         encounters the Minotaur. It is where one confronts the disquieting, meets         terror and anxiety, and where one loses one's breath and comes upon the         <i>'fear in our stomachs that teaches us to build - to domesticate risk.'         </i></p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_12a.jpg" width="250" height="70" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 12:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, Abraham's window on the world, 1988; black and white negative,               project file.

He lies on his bed at the level of the original delta. He         rests, trans/figured, on the remade earth: growing in the open air, eating         and sleeping on and with the earth, his reconstituted and sustaining 'ground.'         It is a world that opens itself up to the land, his land. He lays claim         to the east and the west, the north and the south. And, he gathers that         land as he lies dying, <i>'propped on the pillow, with his head raised         so that he can see out of the window as his curtains move gracefully in         the breeze.'</i> Bound to that land by his infirmity, he gathers its four         horizons and claims its four directions. Abraham lies dying/living in         and on his ground. He inhales great draughts of space, uplifted, resurrected,         redeemed and revealed. He is made good again, and lies/dies holding his         goodness, larger and better than he thought. It is a better house to lie         in, but, a better house to die in. Abraham, dead, is buried and lies in         his own ground. He finds rest in his in his well-crafted box. Like Addie         Bundren, he could not want a better one, a better box to lie in. It gives         comfort confidence and comfort, because it held the secret of the making         of the best persons <i>who grow in the open air, and eat and sleep with         the earth</i>, fig. 12.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>sub-text 6:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">In the early pre-texts for the project there is no Burnden         Abraham. The client is called Mark Veritan. His story, as it appears in         the pre-texts, is identical to Abraham's story. He is there in one text,         gone the next. There is no record of how he came into the narrative, nor         one that tells why he left the project's narrative as abruptly as he did.         There is also no record of the coming of Burnden Abraham into the architect's         narrative. </p>      <p class="eighth">Burnden Abraham's coming is clearly no accident and neither         is the choice of that name. The persona is just too well developed. Its         links with the Faulkner tale are just too carefully wrought for his coming         to have been an afterthought. His arrival and his character clearly constitute         an intentional sub-text within the intellectual and imaginative fabric         of the project. Burnden is quite obviously an anagram derived from Bundren.         This is a sportive play that weds the main characters in two stories:         Faulkner's story and Darden's tale. Making that link is easy. But why         did Darden choose the name Abraham? There are no parallel characters in         <i>As I Lay Dying</i>. The name Abraham does not appear in that work.         Nor does a character with the name Abraham assume any significant role         in any of the other works by Faulkner. So, whence Abraham? And why?</p>      <p class="eighth">There are scriptural themes embedded in many of Douglas         Darden's projects. The use of the Whitman excerpt as a sub-text in the         text for Oxygen House puts a number of scriptural ideas and references         into play, as do a range of other ideas and elements which are central         to the project beneath the project, the program behind the program. The         ideas of revelation, redemption, transfiguration and even resurrection         implied by the Whitman piece make clear allusions to scripture, as is         the idea of holding so much goodness. The transformation of the fabric         of the oxygen tent into the shroud is pregnant with scriptural connections,         as is the use of the lift shaft with its lidded cover - the constructed         cave - as Abraham's tomb. The presence of the tree in the blockhouse -         the burial chamber/field - and its proximity to the well-spring also points         to scripture. The presence of the willow that stands near the spring,         biding its time, living, dying and being brought back to new life each         spring does as well.</p>      <p class="eighth"><i>'Oxygen House is,'</i> at one level and in Darden's         words, <i>' a meditation on the so-called death of the South.'</i> It         is also, quite inevitably, a meditation on the South's transformation,         transfiguration and redemption. Abraham, as the central character in that         meditation, is the metaphor that holds the story of his dying land, the         lost south. Just as Abraham, the great patriarch in the Genesis narrative,         held the story and the hope of his age: the hope of the promised land.         The stories in the two texts each describe their Abraham and their Abraham's         tomb in remarkably similar ways. Each has a woman who 'acts as a hinge'         in their lives. The Abraham in Genesis has Sarah; the Abraham in Oxygen         House has Jewel.<sup>19</sup> Both Abraham's, as death drew near, established         themselves in what had been <i>'the land of their sojourning.'</i> Both         '<i>placed</i>' themselves by buying the land where they were to be buried.         Each was buried in a cave in a field, near a tree and a spring. And each         was buried, as scripture puts it, <i>'on his own ground.'</i> While the         Abraham of Genesis 'lay buried on his own ground,' the Abraham who exists         as the metaphor for the lost South<i> 'stood buried on his own ground.</i>'         He, as Douglas Darden no doubt intended it, <i>'stood (and stands) <s>buried         on</s> his <s>own</s> ground.'</i></p>      <p class="eighth"><b>epilogue: last things</b></p>      <p class="eighth">Oxygen House is an enormously rich and complex project,         as this tentative unwrapping of its 'soft' technologies has tried to show.         <i>'Its entire realm,'</i> to return to Bernd Jager's realization, '<i>is         intersected with curvatures, stops and starts, adaptations, changes of         mind, irregular weaving.' </i>It is a quilt, a tapestry, a weaving. It         is, as are all quilts, a complex text. It is an archai-text that sets         out to tell a range of intertwined tales, with interwoven plots, that         show forth the basic elements out of which all real experience is made.         Its 'official' texts are opaque, and cloak and hide its elusive interiors.         Rooms in which one encounters the reality that has been brought into being         by and through a profound imagination.</p>      <p class="eighth">Douglas Darden, the project's architect, died on April         3, 1996. In a letter he wrote to an architect in Oxford, Mississippi on         July 20, 1991, but evidently never sent, he made the following comment:       </p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>I must tell you that when I designed Oxygen House           years ago I had no way of knowing how autobiographical the project would           become&middot; I myself was diagnosed last year with a rare kind of           leukemia that my doctors stubbornly and somewhat ruthlessly call 'terminal'&middot;           It too, am stubborn and ruthless, but on the side of life. (According           to two 'experts', I was supposed to be dead last January. I am happy           to have proven - and to continue to prove - them liars&middot;) <br>          <br>          I discovered doing Oxygen House that when one is willing to really delve           into a question and unearth the truth about it, the work that one has           done can't help but be personal. I have no way of knowing for sure,           but I believe now that when I designed Oxygen House my body KNEW that           I had cancer. I was acting out my own difficult connection to that mysterious           thing we call LIFE. This to me is all that architecture IS: By designing           a building the architect asks us to envision a certain attitude towards           life and what it means to be alive.<sup>20</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <p class="eighth">In a letter dated May 25, 1993, discussing Oxygen House         he sent to the editor of <i>Southern Quarterly</i> that was printed as         an appendix to its publication of the project, the architect writes:</p>      <blockquote>         <p class="eighth"><i>&quot;Oxygen House&quot; was completed in 1988. Two           years later I was diagnosed with cancer. At the time that I designed           &quot;Oxygen House&quot; I felt that I had cleverly invented Abraham.           I thought that the project was operating purely outside myself, in the           realm of art and ideas. I had no inkling that I had cancer, even though           today, I am sure that it was present in my body when I designed the           project. Now when I read Burnden Abraham's letter I realize that there           was a deep knowledge within my own body which was being exer/exorcised           through the project. Long before I knew that I had cancer and was able           to come to terms intellectually with the disease inside of me, my body           was struggling to work out its own sensed understanding of the mortal           flesh. The friction between this incomplete understanding and my simultaneous           ignorance drove the project's creation.<sup>21</sup></i></p>      </blockquote>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/schnei_13a.gif" width="120" height="146" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 13:</b> Douglas Darden; Oxygen               House, elevation from west, 1988; pencil, graphite, white crayon,               ink on Strathmore paper, 28x34 inches.

That work became         the frame through which he refined and redefined his architecture: <i>&quot;this         to me is all that architecture IS: by designing a building the architect         asks us to envision a certain attitude towards life and what it means         to be alive.&quot;</i> For, after all, as Louis Kahn told us: &quot;<i>to         make a building is to make a life!&quot;</i> And, if one does it well         and gets it right, as Douglas Darden did, it speaks to us compellingly         in strange and beautiful ways, fig. 13.</p>      <p>       <p class="eighth">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="eighth">&nbsp;</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Notes</b></p>      <p class="eighth">1.

There is a sleeve with 35mm color negatives of that         'little industrial building cast out on an open field in the country just         north of Oxford, Mississippi.' There are also two business cards with         the initial sketches for the project. The connections between the emerging         idea for oxygen house and the existing industrial building are quite evident.         The business cards are Douglas Darden's and give his address as Jersey         City, New Jersey. A careful inspection of the images of the 'little industrial         building cast out in an open field in the country just north of Oxford,         Mississippi' show that it is in fact cast out in an industrial area on         the New Jersey shore of the Hudson river, opposite the World Trade Towers         in Manhattan.</p>      <p class="eighth">9.
