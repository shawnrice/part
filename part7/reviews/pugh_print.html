The title of the show, &quot;Masterpieces         of the Vitra Design Museum,&quot; was strangely inclusive considering         99.9% of the pieces in the show were chairs. This was a veritable visual         encyclopedia of chair design, featuring selections from designers such         as Charles Eames, Eero Saarinen, Karl Schinkel, and Phillipe Starck. If         one had never seen an original Eames Lounge Chair (1956) or Nelson Marshmallow         couch (1956), this was the place to tic those boxes. Although it certainly         was nice to see the real thing, the ubiquity of these pieces (the former         can be seen in Frasier Cranes' apartment and the latter in Austin Powers'         bachelor pad in The Spy who Shagged Me) made the trip to the Cooper-Hewitt         seem almost unnecessary. In fact, if one learned nothing else from the         show, it was about the enduring popularity of many of the pieces exhibited.<br>      </p>      <p class="eighth">By displaying chairs almost exclusively, the Cooper-Hewitt         nicely maintained a focus on the design of the chairs. This also highlighted         their considerable aesthetic qualities. For what better way to examine         the principals of and approaches to design than by assembling a myriad         of pieces that perform the same essential function and exhibit a myriad         of design approaches? After looking at chair after chair, this reviewer         could not help considering the utility of each piece in addition to its         aesthetic appeal or lack thereof. The large, red UP 5 designed by Gaetano         Pesce (1969), for example, seemed almost perverse in its overbearing,         voluptuous form. Its label stated that the chair and its ottoman were         meant to evoke a female form and specifically the female as the &quot;ball         and chain.&quot; Indeed, with its red nylon covering oozing from behind         the upholstery buttons and attached by a string to a ball-shaped ottoman,         the puffy foam chair did suggest as much. This being the third room of         chairs, however, when seen from across the room, one's first thought was         &quot;gosh that looks comfy.&quot; This reaction is in contrast to that         experienced upon entering the exhibit; then, one admired the sleek design         of Rietveld's Roodblauwe Stool (1918) rather than wincing at the though         of trying to settle into such unyielding wooden boards.</p>      <p class="eighth">The chairs were not simply placed in the rooms willy-nilly,         however. The curators organized the show along broad themes: manifesto,         reduction, decoration, organic design technology. These groupings were         announced as names stenciled on the wall of each room accompanied by a         few lines of text. To be honest, they were hardly noticeable. Because         the wall text provided less than rigorous categorizing (the chairs in         the &quot;manifesto&quot; room might just have easily appeared in the         &quot;decoration&quot; room), one simply appreciated each chair and considered         its success or failure as a seating device. It might have been better         if the chairs had been placed in the galleries to be absorbed and quantified         at leisure.</p>      <p class="eighth">One was also given the opportunity to appreciate the unique         relationship between chair design and technological advancement. Though         the object of the chair itself is very basic, designers have turned to         the latest in modern materials and machining to make their chairs. Karl         Friedrich Schinkel's Garden Chair (1820-25) shows that technological concerns         in furniture making has long been present. The Garden Chair's cast-iron         construction represents the impact of the Industrial Revolution on furniture         design and construction. In the 20th century, Charles and Ray Eames became         known for their use of technology to produce sleek, modern chair designs         that could be mass-produced and sold cheaply. Their 1950-53 fiberglass         molded Plastic Side Chairs are but one example of their achievements.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/pugh_2a.jpg" width="120" height="110">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth">               <p><b>Fig 2:</b> Alexander Girard.

It was also better organized and         more focused. This show provided the visitor with a comprehensive overview         of Girard's work and, in doing so, provided insight into 1960s design         aesthetic in general.</p>      <p class="eighth">Girard (1907-93) was raised in Italy and educated as an         architect in Rome and London before moving to the United States in 1932.         After World War II, he worked with the Eameses, Eero Saarinen and George         Nelson, joining their quest to provide accessible modern design to the         middle class. Ultimately, as explained in the show's brochure, Girard         &quot;defined a 'look' that became synonymous with the 1960s.&quot; The         Cooper-Hewitt's exhibition was an attempt to capture this look and examine         the man behind it. And, in a relatively small space, the museum was largely         successful in encapsulating a particularly wide-ranging career. Like the         Eameses, Girard seems to have tried his hand at just about everything         from furniture design to matchbook covers. They seem to have subscribed         to a conception of design as a set of universally applicable principals,         rather than specific motifs, patterns and blueprints. To demonstrate the         depth of Girard's work and interests this show was filled with an eclectic         range of objects and media. These included examples of his own designs         as well as selections from his folk art and matchbook collections. Clearly         organized rooms and specific areas of the gallery were dedicated to individual         projects on which Girard worked or with which he was involved. For example,         one wall focused on Girard's work for Braniff airlines by displaying his         mock-ups for salt and pepper packets along with photos of flight attendants         jauntily posed in the colorful clothes Girard designed in collaboration         with Pucci. Another room focused on Girard's textile design and featured         examples of his designs hung in tapestry fashion on each wall of the room         (Fig 2.).</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td valign="bottom">             <center>              <img src="gr/pugh_3a.jpg" width="235" height="72">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Alexander Girard.               La Fonda del Sol matchbook covers, circa 1961.

Although he collaborated         with the Eames's office on this project (the Eames specially designed         chairs for the restaurant), it reflects Girard's ability to create a design         scheme and carry it through a wide range of objects of varied use and         materials. Featured in the show are a scale model of the restaurant and         numerous items he designed for it, from dishware to matchbooks (Fig 3).         The restaurant was well received by the public and served to establish         Girard's reputation in the design community.</p>      <p class="eighth"> With its myriad of objects in rich colors and patterns,         the Girard exhibit was, if nothing else, a great pleasure to look at.         Juxtaposed with the more circumscribed scope of the Vitra Design show,         the two were a satisfying, not unrelated pair. Once one had marveled at         the amazing variety of chairs and their admirable use of high technology,         one could go upstairs and marvel at the amazing variety of designs within         the career of one man. Thus, in one afternoon could one be both educated         and entertained.</p>      <p class="eighth">To see more images from these shows, visit the Past Exhibitions         portion of the Cooper-Hewitt's web site: http://www.si.edu/ndm.
