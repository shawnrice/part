A 462- page catalogue               edited by Kirkham, with contributions by leading scholars, accompanies               the exhibition. The stated goals of the project are to celebrate               women's achievements in design and to address the roles of gender,               class, race, and training in the practice of design. Although a               laudable enterprise, the project <i>Women Designers</i> is deeply               problematic.<br>            </p>            <p class="second">The first issue is Kirkham's inclusive definition               of design. Exhibited with more-or-less typical examples of industrial               and product design (appliances, posters, chairs, and textiles) are               items of fashion, interior design, landscape architecture, and film               costume and production design. Also prominent are objects traditionally               considered crafts: quilts, basketry, pottery, and jewelry. Most               of the &quot;designers&quot; featured in the exhibition would doubtless               be surprised and even affronted by that designation. </p>            <p class="second">Design can be a very amorphous term, as is evident               by the collections of hatboxes, silverware, Homer oil sketches,               and yads at Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. However, design               as a catch-all category for an exhibition makes for a motley assortment               of stuff. Dis-united under the rubric &quot;diversity and difference&quot;               and shoehorned into small galleries, the objects don't say much               to each other or to the viewer. </p>            <p class="second">An overly expansive concept of design is compounded               by an equally narrow representation of works. Kirkham relates that               although Bard Director Susan Weber Soros and board member Shelby               White had proposed the idea of an exhibition on women designers,               they were skeptical when she told them it would be necessary to               limit its scope. Kirkham confined the project to designers who worked               in the United States during the twentieth century. And she restricted               the exhibition to only one work from each designer. This seemingly               egalitarian approach backfires in the presentation. The only selection               criteria appear to be those of gender, date, and location. There               is little attempt to treat or interpret objects aesthetically. The               exhibition is clearly not about the products of design; it is about               the producers of design. </p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="eggebe_2.html"><img src="gr/eggebe_2a.jpg" width="167" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth">                     <p><a href="eggebe_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig 2:</b> There                       are very few appliances, such as Lisa Krohn's "phonebook",                       designed by women.<br>                      </a><a href="eggebe_2.html" target="_blank">Lisa Krohn.                       Prototype of "phonebook" telephone answering machine, 1980-85.                       Wood plastic, and light-emitting-diode (LED).

It has essays               on African American women designers and Native American women designers,               as well as essays on women designers in various media: metal, ceramics,               textiles, and so forth. (The separate discussion of &quot;minority               ethnic&quot; women is meant to counteract the &quot;eurocentrism&quot;               of design scholarship.) However, by choosing to focus on the designers,               the catalogue struggles to find an alternative to the &quot;heroes&quot;               paradigm set up by the design field's most well known historian,               Nikolaus Pevsner. The catalogue claims to counter the canon-forming               approach of Pevsner's <i>Pioneers of Modern Design</i>, which saw               design history in terms of progress towards Modernism. Yet <i>Women               Designers</i> has a narrative too; its story is the triumph of feminism.             </p>            <p class="second">One aspect of the catalogue is particularly disagreeable.               A timeline, called a &quot;Context Line&quot;, notes miscellaneous               information involving twentieth-century American women. Like the               exhibition, little attempt was made to select items of importance               or which have any bearing on each other. It is hard to make anything               of the fact that in 1904 Lena and Lydia Burton Conley protested               against plans to build on a Native American burial site, or that               <i>Seventeen</i> magazine was founded in 1944 and that Ellen DeGeneres               declared herself a lesbian in 1997. The benefit of being able to               present in the catalogue more nuanced &quot;herstories&quot; is               mitigated by the same lack of selective criteria affecting the exhibition.             </p>            <table width="180" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="eggebe_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/eggebe_3a.jpg" width="100" height="168" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                   </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="eggebe_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> Graphic design--of which Elaine Lustig Cohen's cover                     is an early representative--is prominent in the exhibition.                     Elaine Lustig Cohen.

Material               culture historian Cheryl Robertson once told me that she often describes               design as &quot;the stuff in your house.&quot; Indeed, design in               the form of appliances, furnishings and interiors is intimately               intertwined with the domestic environment. Proficiency in design               and skill in the decorative arts were long viewed as suitable &quot;accomplishments&quot;               for bourgeois women and a means of support for working-class women.               Therefore, a number of schools in design or its various branches               were set up for women at the end of the nineteenth century. In the               twentieth century, the amateur, domestic nature of most design and               the anonymity of company staff designers proved a fertile field               for women. </p>            <p class="second">Design, as a profession, is a relatively recent               development. Early male industrial designers of the thirties, such               as Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond<br>              Loewy, Donald Desky, and Norman Bel Geddes, had backgrounds in set               design, fashion illustration, or store window display. They had               to actively promote themselves and sell manufacturers on the advantages               of design. Nonetheless they were considered merely product stylists               since their job was essentially to add eye appeal. The Museum of               Modern Art's landmark exhibition of 1951, <i>Good Design</i>, featured               springs, propellers, and meat grinders that spoke of Le Corbusier's               notion of a process of &quot;mechanical selection&quot;-of the engineer               rather than of the designer. <br>            </p>            <p class="second">The point is that while the practice of design may               be gendered--with women discouraged from working with hard materials               such as metal or wood, for example--the field itself has historically               been &quot;feminized&quot; by both industry and academia. In the               art historical hierarchy, the functional object holds the status               of a minor or decorative art rarely worthy of serious study. In               practice, design is all too often reduced to product styling. </p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="eggebe_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/eggebe_4a.jpg" width="165" height="105" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                   </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="eggebe_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> This brooch by Phyllis Marie Bowdwin is an example                     of &quot;ethnic minority&quot; design in <i>Women Designers                     in the USA, 1900-2000</i>.<br>                    Phyllis Marie Bowdwin.

Never heard of them? You are not               alone. On one hand, this lack of name recognition is due to the               broadening of the terms of design to incorporate Pueblo potters               and fashionistas, jewelers and typographers. On the other hand,               it points out women designers' obscurity in a field where identity               is paramount. The catalogue of <i>Women Designers</i> is a valuable               source in illuminating the careers and historical context of American               women designers, although it ignores the larger issue of recognition               for the field of design. Perhaps the main reason that women designers               such as Maria Martinez are not household names is not entirely due               to their specialization or their gender, but because design has               not really entered public or academic discourse. </p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="eggebe_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../gr/parthome.gif" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&copy;       2001 P<i>ART</i> and Janna Eggebeen.
