The title of               the show, &quot;Masterpieces of the Vitra Design Museum,&quot; was               strangely inclusive considering 99.9% of the pieces in the show               were chairs. This was a veritable visual encyclopedia of chair design,               featuring selections from designers such as Charles Eames, Eero               Saarinen, Karl Schinkel, and Phillipe Starck. If one had never seen               an original Eames Lounge Chair (1956) or Nelson Marshmallow couch               (1956), this was the place to tic those boxes. Although it certainly               was nice to see the real thing, the ubiquity of these pieces (the               former can be seen in Frasier Cranes' apartment and the latter in               Austin Powers' bachelor pad in The Spy who Shagged Me) made the               trip to the Cooper-Hewitt seem almost unnecessary. In fact, if one               learned nothing else from the show, it was about the enduring popularity               of many of the pieces exhibited.<br>            </p>            <p class="second">By displaying chairs almost exclusively, the Cooper-Hewitt               nicely maintained a focus on the design of the chairs. This also               highlighted their considerable aesthetic qualities. For what better               way to examine the principals of and approaches to design than by               assembling a myriad of pieces that perform the same essential function               and exhibit a myriad of design approaches? After looking at chair               after chair, this reviewer could not help considering the utility               of each piece in addition to its aesthetic appeal or lack thereof.               The large, red UP 5 designed by Gaetano Pesce (1969), for example,               seemed almost perverse in its overbearing, voluptuous form. Its               label stated that the chair and its ottoman were meant to evoke               a female form and specifically the female as the &quot;ball and               chain.&quot; Indeed, with its red nylon covering oozing from behind               the upholstery buttons and attached by a string to a ball-shaped               ottoman, the puffy foam chair did suggest as much. This being the               third room of chairs, however, when seen from across the room, one's               first thought was &quot;gosh that looks comfy.&quot; This reaction               is in contrast to that experienced upon entering the exhibit; then,               one admired the sleek design of Rietveld's Roodblauwe Stool (1918)               rather than wincing at the though of trying to settle into such               unyielding wooden boards.</p>            <p class="second">The chairs were not simply placed in the rooms willy-nilly,               however. The curators organized the show along broad themes: manifesto,               reduction, decoration, organic design technology. These groupings               were announced as names stenciled on the wall of each room accompanied               by a few lines of text. To be honest, they were hardly noticeable.               Because the wall text provided less than rigorous categorizing (the               chairs in the &quot;manifesto&quot; room might just have easily               appeared in the &quot;decoration&quot; room), one simply appreciated               each chair and considered its success or failure as a seating device.               It might have been better if the chairs had been placed in the galleries               to be absorbed and quantified at leisure.</p>            <p class="second">One was also given the opportunity to appreciate               the unique relationship between chair design and technological advancement.               Though the object of the chair itself is very basic, designers have               turned to the latest in modern materials and machining to make their               chairs. Karl Friedrich Schinkel's Garden Chair (1820-25) shows that               technological concerns in furniture making has long been present.               The Garden Chair's cast-iron construction represents the impact               of the Industrial Revolution on furniture design and construction.               In the 20th century, Charles and Ray Eames became known for their               use of technology to produce sleek, modern chair designs that could               be mass-produced and sold cheaply. Their 1950-53 fiberglass molded               Plastic Side Chairs are but one example of their achievements.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td valign="bottom">                     <a href="pugh_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/pugh_2a.jpg" width="120" height="110" alt="click to see larger view" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth">                     <p><a href="pugh_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig 2:</b> Alexander                       Girard.

It was also better               organized and more focused. This show provided the visitor with               a comprehensive overview of Girard's work and, in doing so, provided               insight into 1960s design aesthetic in general.</p>            <p class="second">Girard (1907-93) was raised in Italy and educated               as an architect in Rome and London before moving to the United States               in 1932. After World War II, he worked with the Eameses, Eero Saarinen               and George Nelson, joining their quest to provide accessible modern               design to the middle class. Ultimately, as explained in the show's               brochure, Girard &quot;defined a 'look' that became synonymous with               the 1960s.&quot; The Cooper-Hewitt's exhibition was an attempt to               capture this look and examine the man behind it. And, in a relatively               small space, the museum was largely successful in encapsulating               a particularly wide-ranging career. Like the Eameses, Girard seems               to have tried his hand at just about everything from furniture design               to matchbook covers. They seem to have subscribed to a conception               of design as a set of universally applicable principals, rather               than specific motifs, patterns and blueprints. To demonstrate the               depth of Girard's work and interests this show was filled with an               eclectic range of objects and media. These included examples of               his own designs as well as selections from his folk art and matchbook               collections. Clearly organized rooms and specific areas of the gallery               were dedicated to individual projects on which Girard worked or               with which he was involved. For example, one wall focused on Girard's               work for Braniff airlines by displaying his mock-ups for salt and               pepper packets along with photos of flight attendants jauntily posed               in the colorful clothes Girard designed in collaboration with Pucci.               Another room focused on Girard's textile design and featured examples               of his designs hung in tapestry fashion on each wall of the room.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td valign="bottom">                   <center>                    <a href="pugh_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/pugh_3a.jpg" width="235" height="72" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a>                   </center>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="pugh_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> Alexander Girard.

Featured in               the show are a scale model of the restaurant and numerous items               he designed for it, from dishware to matchbooks (Fig 3). The restaurant               was well received by the public and served to establish Girard's               reputation in the design community.</p>            <p class="second"> With its myriad of objects in rich colors and patterns,               the Girard exhibit was, if nothing else, a great pleasure to look               at. Juxtaposed with the more circumscribed scope of the Vitra Design               show, the two were a satisfying, not unrelated pair. Once one had               marveled at the amazing variety of chairs and their admirable use               of high technology, one could go upstairs and marvel at the amazing               variety of designs within the career of one man.
