With polite ellipsis the sedate         Morgan attempts to correlate Ruskin's perverse emotional landscape with         his grand views of palpable landscape, architecture, and art. Here the         visitor finds all the debris of angst and bodies to be expected from a         psycho-biographical dissection. The carnage is contained on pages of cramped         and lyrical writing and in prison-like grids of words set at right angles         to one another. These artifacts are further secreted in glass vitrines         and encased in the hush of the Morgan, an institution that retains in         the 21st century a feeling of dim, tearoom propriety. Within the exhibition,         a strange mechanical whir made itself felt near one vitrine, and a visitor         jumped away in fear that she was being chastised publicly for leaning         on the glass. The noise, however, emanated from deeper within the walls,         climate control or ventilation. Still, a spirit of repression and the         threat of a public slap on the wrist seem apt if unintended companions         for this tour of Ruskin's aesthetic manifestoes and misaimed arrows of         love. <br>      </p>      <p class="eighth">John Ruskin was the pre-eminent figure in Victorian art         criticism. He helped initiate the Gothic Revival movement in architecture         and championed the literature and art of the otherwise disparaged Pre-Raphaelites.         Ruskin's prescient admiration of British landscape painter J.M.W. Turner         was so immense that it inspired a caricature of the critic trumpeting         from two horns his own glory and that of the ur-Impressionist. Long-lived         and enormously prolific, Ruskin produced tracts on social issues, literary         essays and art reviews along with 39 full-length works. These included         <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> and <i>The Stones of Venice</i>.         A few of his sketches and meticulous drawings for the latter volume were         on view at the Morgan. Ruskin's evangelical voice profoundly influenced         a century's direction of writing on art and architecture. Today, however,         his critical presence has dissolved to a Turner-esque haze.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/hymowi_2a.jpg" width="235" height="105" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth">               <p><b>Fig 2:</b> John Ruskin (1819-1900) Manuscript leaf from The                 Stones of Venice The Pierpont Morgan Library, Purchased by Pierpont                 Morgan, 1907, MA 398-400 Photography by Schecter Lee and Joseph                 Zehavi ©The Pierpont Morgan Library, 2000. </p>            </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p class="eighth">By providing material evidence of Ruskin's life Morgan         curator Robert Parks attempted to suggest a resurrected Ruskin. With deceptive         candor, the Library draws exclusively upon its seemingly limitless archival         reserves to chronicle Ruskin's critical output, the peculiarly Victorian         circumstances of his scandalous marriage and his questionable affection         for young girls. These archives include the Bowerswell Papers, encompassing         letters and other material from the families of his former wife and her         second husband, the Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais (1829-1896).         To animate his revived subject Parks also includes Ruskin's childhood         mineral collection, teen-age sermons, self-portrait and, of course, his         own letters and those of his family, friends and colleagues among the         displayed items.</p>      <p class="eighth">Rather than the Italy and England of the exhibition's         title, the true compass points of the Morgan's topography are Ruskin's         aesthetic genius and his cold-blooded yet passionate assessment of contemporary         England and Italy. Grafted onto these points is the critic's personal         trajectory, from cosseted wunderkind to emotionally sadistic husband to         frenzied admirer of frocked little girls. As the Morgan notes, Ruskin's         marriage of six years was publicly annulled for non-consummation; his         ex-wife quickly rebounded with a marriage to Millais. That artist's intimate         drawing of Mrs. Ruskin cutting his hair (<i>The Countess as Barber</i>,         1853) offers the only view of a domestic interior in the Morgan exhibition.         This sweet domesticity opposes the public and exterior nature of Ruskin's         political and architectural pre-occupations, his forums and facades.</p>      <p class="eighth">In fact, it is interesting to consider Ruskin's life from         the point of view of architecture, both interior and exterior. The frontages         of buildings, their exteriority, served for Ruskin as sources of spiritual         allegory. In this way, architecture shared characteristics with the nature         depicted in Turner's paintings. Both were expressive and spiritual. The         Morgan goes further, making a metaphor of the exteriority of visual enterprise.         The exhibition suggests that Ruskin's public persona, offered a facade         of reasoned and harmonious thought. Yet, public scandal over his annulled         marriage and documentation of his perverse interest in young girls betray         interior disorder under this scaffold of erudition. Similarly, although         his family presented an exterior of prosperous conventionality, internally         they presented a white-knuckled grasp of Arcadia. This is first seen in         his parents' consanguinity: they were first cousins. It continued with         their claustrophobic exclusion of outsiders which was most clearly expressed         in their lack of sympathy for their daughter-in-law.</p>      <p class="eighth">Despite their distrust of outsiders, the young Ruskin         was allowed to travel. He began a lifetime of travels to Italy at 13 in         1833. His wine-merchant father had business there, and his Bible-imbibing         mother seized upon Italy as a worthy holiday destination.<sup>1</sup>         The contrast of an increasingly industrialized and gritty England to the         light-saturated splendor of the Italian buildings profoundly influenced         his ideas on industrialization and architecture. Thus, the architecture         of Italy played a major role in his life.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/hymowi_3a.jpg" width="190" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Joseph Mallord William               Turner (1775-1851) <i>The Pass at Faido</i>, St. Gotthard Watercolor,               point of brush, scratching out, over traces of pencil 12 x 18.5               inches (303 x 469 mm) Thaw Collection, The Pierpont Morgan Library               Photography by David A.

Before John Ruskin's birth, his maternal         grandfather had committed suicide at home, probably by slitting his throat.         Two generations later, when Ruskin wanted to marry Euphemia (&quot;Effie&quot;)         Chalmers Gray, one of his mother's objections to the match was that the         proposed bride had grown up in this grandfather's house. For Mrs. Ruskin,         the hapless Effie was a walking memento mori. The young woman's childhood         house--built architecture--blurred into a sad facet of personality.</p>      <p class="eighth"> Of course, much of Ruskin's renown rightfully stemmed         from his persuasive arguments on art and architecture. Mixing exterior         and interior, he brought &quot;the story of his own life&quot; to this         august commentary, lacing it with &quot;his upbringing, religious doubts,         emotional attachments, and bouts of madness.&quot;<sup>2</sup> The Morgan         notes that the 1849 publication of <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>         established Ruskin as &quot;a central figure in the Gothic Revival movement.&quot;         He persuasively argued that when measured against the expressiveness of         Gothic architecture contemporary English buildings appeared dolefully         deficient. Ruskin lamented that: &quot;All that we do is small and mean...thin,         and wasted, and unsubstantial.&quot; By contrast, each ornament and detail         of Gothic architecture contained an allegory of nationalism and identification.</p>      <p class="eighth">Excerpts of Ruskin's steely criticism are matched by implication         with evidence of his coldness toward his wife in the Morgan's psychologically         informed approach. &quot;Ruskin's Italy, Ruskin's England&quot; suggests         that the Magi-like adoration by his parents, well into his adulthood,         caused Ruskin's arrested development and doomed him sexually. For example,         he never consummated this marriage to Effie.</p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/hymowi_4a.jpg" width="163" height="130" border="0" alt="click to see larger view">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4:</b> John Everett Millais               (1929-1896) <i>The Countess as Barber</i> Pen and brown ink on wove               paper 7.3 x 9 inches (187 x 230 mm) Lettered by the artist at upper               left, The Countess as Barber.

She         refused his proposal of marriage and died not long after, plunging her         desperate suitor into an irremediable decline. An inconsolable Ruskin         incorporated roses into colophons for a series of 96 &quot;Letters to         the Workmen and Labourers of England,&quot; peculiarly mixing tracts on         social reform with the most private form of sentiment.<sup>3</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">The Morgan's psycho-biographical approach shadows Ruskin's         own critical work. These writings documented and were informed by his         personal reactions to landscape and to art. George P. Landow, Brown University         Professor of Art History and English, has noted that in including &quot;his         own experience&quot; when re-creating a work of art in words, Ruskin was         &quot;like the evangelical preacher and the romantic poet,&quot;<sup>4</sup>         both staples of the Victorian era. Landow observes that Ruskin applied         the syntax of sermons to form an evangelical template for art criticism.         The critic used the hortatory conviction of the evangelical to promote         the spiritually expressive power of the art and architecture he admired.</p>      <p class="eighth">The Morgan does not take to the pulpit but rather indirectly         speaks of Ruskin's improprieties and perversions in its efforts to redirect         attention to Ruskin's greatness as a critic of art and architecture and         as a social reformer. In his recent biography, <i>John Ruskin: The Later         Years</i>, Tim Hilton suggests more explicitly that the critic actively         pursued social discourse with young girls.<sup>5</sup> In her <i>New York         Times</i> review of his book, Valentine Cunningham calls Hilton's revelations         &quot;an arresting record of Ruskin's crippling obsession with little         girls -- at schools he endowed, in London parks, by the Italian wayside,         in the studio of the illustrator Kate Greenaway (he made up to her little         models with gifts of skipping ropes and magnetic fish).&quot;<sup>6</sup></p>      <p class="eighth">In his &quot;mentoring&quot; of Greenaway, the renowned         critic urged her to produce for him versions of her cottage-y little girls         with, as the Morgan text puts it, &quot;less clothing.&quot; In one of         a number of unselfconsciously perverse letters to Greenaway, Ruskin wrote         of a young model: &quot;Draw her for me without her hat...and, without         her shoes.&quot; It is possible that details such as these were not substantiated         in documents owned by the Morgan, and for this reason do not surface in         its exhibition.</p>      <p class="eighth">In the end, it does not seem that the Morgan has attempted         to hush up the dark side of John Ruskin so much as to pay homage to the         forces that made him what he was. Ruskin's ability to train his eye on         a landscape or a stone ornament or to be transfixed by a little girl spoke         to a singularity of purpose and a complexity of vision emblematic of the         Victorian age. While its title suggests directionality, &quot;Ruskin's         Italy, Ruskin's England,&quot; is all about indirection, about sunlight         and shadow, and that seems in every way correct.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Notes:</b></p>      <p class="eighth"> 1.
