A 462- page catalogue edited by Kirkham,         with contributions by leading scholars, accompanies the exhibition. The         stated goals of the project are to celebrate women's achievements in design         and to address the roles of gender, class, race, and training in the practice         of design. Although a laudable enterprise, the project <i>Women Designers</i>         is deeply problematic.<br>      </p>      <p class="eighth">The first issue is Kirkham's inclusive definition of design.         Exhibited with more-or-less typical examples of industrial and product         design (appliances, posters, chairs, and textiles) are items of fashion,         interior design, landscape architecture, and film costume and production         design. Also prominent are objects traditionally considered crafts: quilts,         basketry, pottery, and jewelry. Most of the &quot;designers&quot; featured         in the exhibition would doubtless be surprised and even affronted by that         designation. </p>      <p class="eighth">Design can be a very amorphous term, as is evident by         the collections of hatboxes, silverware, Homer oil sketches, and yads         at Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum. However, design as a catch-all         category for an exhibition makes for a motley assortment of stuff. Dis-united         under the rubric &quot;diversity and difference&quot; and shoehorned into         small galleries, the objects don't say much to each other or to the viewer.       </p>      <p class="eighth">An overly expansive concept of design is compounded by         an equally narrow representation of works. Kirkham relates that although         Bard Director Susan Weber Soros and board member Shelby White had proposed         the idea of an exhibition on women designers, they were skeptical when         she told them it would be necessary to limit its scope. Kirkham confined         the project to designers who worked in the United States during the twentieth         century. And she restricted the exhibition to only one work from each         designer. This seemingly egalitarian approach backfires in the presentation.         The only selection criteria appear to be those of gender, date, and location.         There is little attempt to treat or interpret objects aesthetically. The         exhibition is clearly not about the products of design; it is about the         producers of design. </p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><img src="gr/eggebe_2a.jpg" width="167" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth">               <p><b>Fig 2:</b> There are very few appliances, such as Lisa Krohn's                 "phonebook", designed by women.<br>                <a href="eggebe_2.html" target="_blank">Lisa Krohn.

It has essays on African         American women designers and Native American women designers, as well         as essays on women designers in various media: metal, ceramics, textiles,         and so forth. (The separate discussion of &quot;minority ethnic&quot;         women is meant to counteract the &quot;eurocentrism&quot; of design scholarship.)         However, by choosing to focus on the designers, the catalogue struggles         to find an alternative to the &quot;heroes&quot; paradigm set up by the         design field's most well known historian, Nikolaus Pevsner. The catalogue         claims to counter the canon-forming approach of Pevsner's <i>Pioneers         of Modern Design</i>, which saw design history in terms of progress towards         Modernism. Yet <i>Women Designers</i> has a narrative too; its story is         the triumph of feminism. </p>      <p class="eighth">One aspect of the catalogue is particularly disagreeable.         A timeline, called a &quot;Context Line&quot;, notes miscellaneous information         involving twentieth-century American women. Like the exhibition, little         attempt was made to select items of importance or which have any bearing         on each other. It is hard to make anything of the fact that in 1904 Lena         and Lydia Burton Conley protested against plans to build on a Native American         burial site, or that <i>Seventeen</i> magazine was founded in 1944 and         that Ellen DeGeneres declared herself a lesbian in 1997. The benefit of         being able to present in the catalogue more nuanced &quot;herstories&quot;         is mitigated by the same lack of selective criteria affecting the exhibition.       </p>      <table width="180" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/eggebe_3a.jpg" width="100" height="168">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Graphic design--of               which Elaine Lustig Cohen's cover is an early representative--is               prominent in the exhibition.

Material culture         historian Cheryl Robertson once told me that she often describes design         as &quot;the stuff in your house.&quot; Indeed, design in the form of         appliances, furnishings and interiors is intimately intertwined with the         domestic environment. Proficiency in design and skill in the decorative         arts were long viewed as suitable &quot;accomplishments&quot; for bourgeois         women and a means of support for working-class women. Therefore, a number         of schools in design or its various branches were set up for women at         the end of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, the amateur,         domestic nature of most design and the anonymity of company staff designers         proved a fertile field for women. </p>      <p class="eighth">Design, as a profession, is a relatively recent development.         Early male industrial designers of the thirties, such as Henry Dreyfuss,         Raymond<br>        Loewy, Donald Desky, and Norman Bel Geddes, had backgrounds in set design,         fashion illustration, or store window display. They had to actively promote         themselves and sell manufacturers on the advantages of design. Nonetheless         they were considered merely product stylists since their job was essentially         to add eye appeal. The Museum of Modern Art's landmark exhibition of 1951,         <i>Good Design</i>, featured springs, propellers, and meat grinders that         spoke of Le Corbusier's notion of a process of &quot;mechanical selection&quot;-of         the engineer rather than of the designer. <br>      </p>      <p class="eighth">The point is that while the practice of design may be         gendered--with women discouraged from working with hard materials such         as metal or wood, for example--the field itself has historically been         &quot;feminized&quot; by both industry and academia. In the art historical         hierarchy, the functional object holds the status of a minor or decorative         art rarely worthy of serious study. In practice, design is all too often         reduced to product styling. </p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/eggebe_4a.jpg" width="165" height="105">             </center>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4:</b> This brooch by Phyllis               Marie Bowdwin is an example of &quot;ethnic minority&quot; design               in <i>Women Designers in the USA, 1900-2000</i>.<br>              Phyllis Marie Bowdwin.

Never heard of them? You are not alone. On one hand, this         lack of name recognition is due to the broadening of the terms of design         to incorporate Pueblo potters and fashionistas, jewelers and typographers.         On the other hand, it points out women designers' obscurity in a field         where identity is paramount. The catalogue of <i>Women Designers</i> is         a valuable source in illuminating the careers and historical context of         American women designers, although it ignores the larger issue of recognition         for the field of design. Perhaps the main reason that women designers         such as Maria Martinez are not household names is not entirely due to         their specialization or their gender, but because design has not really         entered public or academic discourse.<br>      </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>                  <p class="eighth"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="1">&copy; 2001 P<i>ART</i> and Janna Eggebeen.
