As the author explains, <i>&quot;analyzing the competing         priorities and allegiances with regards to civic architecture we can literally         observe the building of a nation reflected in the building of its institutions.&quot;</i>         [p 148]. In exploring these issues she discusses the often conflicting         ideas of &quot;becoming European&quot; while searching for &quot;Greekness&quot;.         One of the ways that architecture and urbanism contributed to the formation         of a new national character was by verifying the distance Greece had moved         away from the &quot;East&quot; (and particularly the Ottoman past) by         becoming all the more closer to an ideal or idealized &quot;West&quot;         (Europe). Bast&eacute;a demonstrates the ways that architecture and urban         planning became essential tools for the creation of an often fragile sense         of national identity and served as symbols of national rebirth.<br>        <br>      </p>      <p class="eighth">In the first chapters, Bast&eacute;a guides us through         the complex political and diplomatic map of modern Greece while also giving         us a sense of the changes that were taking place within Greek culture         and society. Her succinct and comprehensive outline of the major historical         events is extremely successful in conveying the main issues that ultimately         became the background to urban developments. Thus, we learn about the         tensions between the Greeks and the Bavarians who held key positions in         the government in the first years of Otto's reign. She also discusses         the &quot;Great Idea&quot; or Greece's dreams of enlarging its territory         to the boundaries of the what had been the Byzantine Empire. One objective         of this plan was to re-Hellenize Istanbul (Constantinople or &quot;The         City&quot;), the Empire's capital and seat of the Orthodox Patriarchite.         More directly connected to urbanization were the major public works initiated         by visionary Prime Minister Charilaos Trikoupis. His modernization program         included building roads, railway lines, harbors, bridges and the opening         of the Corinth Canal. Much of this infrastructure was constructed in the         last two decades of the nineteenth century. Bast&eacute;a writes: &quot;Planning         came to signify national progress. In fact new buildings and streets were         often the only bright spots in the horizon --visible markers of progress         and success [...] And [...] the government initiated and controlled space,         just as it controlled the development of the Greek language, history and         religion.&quot; (p 43).</p>      <p class="eighth">Yet, this nation building project was not without its         conflicts and<br>        contradictions. Bast&eacute;a's study is made more compelling by her exploration         of these. Greeks felt they had to make a leap &quot;from barbarity to         civilization.&quot; This leap and the corresponding desire to be identified         with the West, was &quot;never monolithic and uncontested&quot;. The author         notes that &quot;many of the leading Greek intellectuals, while usually         trained in the West themselves, cautioned against an indiscriminate and         wholesale imitation of the West; while <i>&quot;the Bavarians were criticized         for assuming Greece to be a tabula rasa.&quot;</i> (p 39). The author         often interjects her text with lively and evocative fragments from the         contemporary Athenian press. In fact, she uses the press as a key method         of analysis by noting the ways in which private citizens voiced their         criticism and even resistance to the official nation-building efforts.         For instance, she mentions the slightly ironic comment from the Athenian         newspaper &quot;Aion&quot; of 1858: <i>&quot;We have no ships, no army,         no roads, but soon we will have an Academy. Turkey, beware!&quot;</i>         [p 160]. This particular comment is indicative of the symbolic power of         the neoclassical architecture of the Academy building by Theophile Hansen,         as a marker of Greece's &quot;progress&quot; and to a so-called return         to her own past.<br>      </p>      <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <center>              <img src="gr/theoch_2a.jpg" width="196" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></center></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth">               <p><b>Fig 2:</b> Back cover image: P.

Although the 1821-27         War of Independence had ended four hundred years of Ottoman rule, the         Greeks of the nineteenth century were left without a strong sense of national         identity. The years of Ottoman oppression had disconnected the nineteenth         century Greeks from their ancient roots. Evidence of this condition was         found in the condition of early nineteenth century Athens, a decrepit         town of ruins. Although to us Athens may seem like the most appropriate         site, it was not everyone's first choice for a capital. In 1835 the newspaper         Athena lamented: &quot;To tell the truth, the seat of the Greek state         does not at all differ from an African or a Turkish city.&quot; (P 11)         That Athens was eventually chosen as the capital may be indicative of         both European political influence and the conceptual power of the romantic         movement of &quot;philhellenism.&quot;<sup>1</sup> On the advice of his         father King Ludwig I of Bavaria, the young Prince Frederick Otto of Wittelsbach         was crowned the first King of the Hellenes in Athens in December 1834.         He immediately began to turn the small provincial city of 6,000 inhabitants         into a new and glorious capital. He wanted to see its classical past reborn         or &quot;revived&quot; along with the birth of the new state.</p>      <p class="eighth">Thus, a sense of national pride was awakened by the creation         of the first &quot;neoclassical&quot; public buildings (Royal Palace,         Academy, National Library, University, Archaeological Museum, the Arsakion         School) that appeared in Athens soon after Otto's ascent to the throne.         The issue of neoclassical architecture as it was introduced by the Germans         or German- educated architects during the early years of the Greek state         was an ideologically loaded one. Bast&eacute;a does not fully explore         the strange conceptual back and forth between German and Greek culture         as it was expressed through the medium of architecture. She concentrates         instead on providing much needed but primarily descriptive analysis of         the main projects and protagonists of the development of modern Athens.</p>      <p class="eighth">Another approach would have paid more attention to the         processes of identification and desire not only on the part of the Greeks         towards the &quot;Europeans&quot; but also of the Europeans, particularly         the Germans, to be identified culturally with classical Greece. Whereas         Greece had been physically colonized by a mighty Eastern empire, in the         nineteenth century the Europeans were colonizing the memory of classical         Greece. This sentiment was succinctly expressed by Wilhelm von Humboldt,         Prussian patron of the arts, philologist and politician, when he proclaimed:         <i>&quot;in the Greeks alone we find the ideal of that which we ourselves         should like to be and produce [...] They move us not with compulsion to         be more like them but with inspiration to be more ourselves&quot;</i><sup>2</sup>.         In turn, during the early years of the Greek state, Greek architects and         patrons were only too happy to uncritically accept a European interpretation         of classical Greece as their own rightful heritage. Therefore, it is somewhat         disappointing that Bast&eacute;a does not introduce the concept of colonial         studies. </p>      <p class="eighth">Bast&eacute;a gives a valuable and richly documented account         of public life and monuments and their role in the establishment of Greek         national identity. But her book would have greatly benefited from a larger         contextualization of the Greek examples. For instance, why does Bast&eacute;a         propose in her study of &quot;Modern Athens&quot; that &quot;the broader         questions of modernity and modernism fall largely outside the territory         of this study&quot;? [P 188] Perhaps this is due to lack of space. In         addition, there are several new works of literature, politics and psychoanalysis         that focus particularly on Greece and explore questions of cultural identity.         This attests to the richness of this field as a topic of investigation         and some of these could have enriched Bastea's more specifically architectural         study. Two that cover similar ground with very different emphases are         Artemis Leontis' <i>Topographies of Hellenism. Mapping the Homeland</i>         (1995) and Stathis Gourgouris' <i>Dream Nation: Enlightenment, Colonization         and the Institution of Modern Greece</i> (1996).</p>      <p class="eighth"> Still, &quot;The Creation of Modern Athens: Planning         The Myth&quot; is a truly insightful work. It is also a necessary book         for any scholar of modern Greece and nineteenth century European architecture         and urbanism. Bast&eacute;a's well-documented study is a significant contribution         to the still underesearched topic of the architectural culture of modern         Greece.</p>      <p class="eighth"><b>Notes:</b></p>      <p class="eighth">1. While this term was first used by Herodotus to characterize         King Amasin of Egypt who was friendly to the Greeks, it took on a more         specific meaning during the 18th century. The &quot;love towards Greeks         or Greece&quot; by the Europeans had to do with supporting the cause of         Greek independence based on various motives but mainly upon an admiration         of ancient Greek culture which inspired a positive and popular approval         and support to the Greek cause in Europe. Among famous European Philhellenes         were Lord Byron, Goethe, Shelley, Pushkin and Delacroix.</p>      <p class="eighth">2.
