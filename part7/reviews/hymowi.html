With polite               ellipsis the sedate Morgan attempts to correlate Ruskin's perverse               emotional landscape with his grand views of palpable landscape,               architecture, and art. Here the visitor finds all the debris of               angst and bodies to be expected from a psycho-biographical dissection.               The carnage is contained on pages of cramped and lyrical writing               and in prison-like grids of words set at right angles to one another.               These artifacts are further secreted in glass vitrines and encased               in the hush of the Morgan, an institution that retains in the 21st               century a feeling of dim, tearoom propriety. Within the exhibition,               a strange mechanical whir made itself felt near one vitrine, and               a visitor jumped away in fear that she was being chastised publicly               for leaning on the glass. The noise, however, emanated from deeper               within the walls, climate control or ventilation. Still, a spirit               of repression and the threat of a public slap on the wrist seem               apt if unintended companions for this tour of Ruskin's aesthetic               manifestos and misaimed arrows of love. <br>            </p>            <p class="second">John Ruskin was the pre-eminent figure in Victorian               art criticism. He helped initiate the Gothic Revival movement in               architecture and championed the literature and art of the otherwise               disparaged Pre-Raphaelites. Ruskin's prescient admiration of British               landscape painter J.M.W. Turner was so immense that it inspired               a caricature of the critic trumpeting from two horns his own glory               and that of the ur-Impressionist. Long-lived and enormously prolific,               Ruskin produced tracts on social issues, literary essays and art               reviews along with 39 full-length works. These included <i>The Seven               Lamps of Architecture</i> and <i>The Stones of Venice</i>. A few               of his sketches and meticulous drawings for the latter volume were               on view at the Morgan. Ruskin's evangelical voice profoundly influenced               a century's direction of writing on art and architecture. Today,               however, his critical presence has dissolved to a Turner-esque haze.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="hymowi_2.html"><img src="gr/hymowi_2a.jpg" width="235" height="105" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth">                     <p><a href="hymowi_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig 2:</b> John Ruskin (1819-1900)Manuscript leaf from The Stones of VeniceThe Pierpont Morgan Library, Purchased by Pierpont Morgan, 1907, MA 398-400Photography by Schecter Lee and Joseph Zehavi ©The Pierpont Morgan Library, 2000.</a></p>                  </div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">By providing material evidence of Ruskin's life               Morgan curator Robert Parks attempted to suggest a resurrected Ruskin.               With deceptive candor, the Library draws exclusively upon its seemingly               limitless archival reserves to chronicle Ruskin's critical output,               the peculiarly Victorian circumstances of his scandalous marriage               and his questionable affection for young girls. These archives include               the Bowerswell Papers, encompassing letters and other material from               the families of his former wife and her second husband, the Pre-Raphaelite               artist John Everett Millais (1829-1896). To animate his revived               subject Parks also includes Ruskin's childhood mineral collection,               teen-age sermons, self-portrait and, of course, his own letters               and those of his family, friends and colleagues among the displayed               items.</p>            <p class="second">Rather than the Italy and England of the exhibition's               title, the true compass points of the Morgan's topography are Ruskin's               aesthetic genius and his cold-blooded yet passionate assessment               of contemporary England and Italy. Grafted onto these points is               the critic's personal trajectory, from cosseted wunderkind to emotionally               sadistic husband to frenzied admirer of frocked little girls. As               the Morgan notes, Ruskin's marriage of six years was publicly annulled               for non-consummation; his ex-wife quickly rebounded with a marriage               to Millais. That artist's intimate drawing of Mrs. Ruskin cutting               his hair (<i>The Countess as Barber</i>, 1853) offers the only view               of a domestic interior in the Morgan exhibition. This sweet domesticity               opposes the public and exterior nature of Ruskin's political and               architectural pre-occupations, his forums and facades.</p>            <p class="second">In fact, it is interesting to consider Ruskin's               life from the point of view of architecture, both interior and exterior.               The frontages of buildings, their exteriority, served for Ruskin               as sources of spiritual allegory. In this way, architecture shared               characteristics with the nature depicted in Turner's paintings.               Both were expressive and spiritual. The Morgan goes further, making               a metaphor of the exteriority of visual enterprise. The exhibition               suggests that Ruskin's public persona offered a facade of reasoned               and harmonious thought. Yet, public scandal over his annulled marriage               and documentation of his perverse interest in young girls betray               interior disorder under this scaffold of erudition. Similarly, although               his family presented an exterior of prosperous conventionality,               internally they presented a white-knuckled grasp of Arcadia. This               is first seen in his parents' consanguinity: they were first cousins.               It continued with their claustrophobic exclusion of outsiders which               was most clearly expressed in their lack of sympathy for their daughter-in-law.</p>            <p class="second">Despite their distrust of outsiders, the young Ruskin               was allowed to travel. He began a lifetime of travels to Italy at               13 in 1833. His wine-merchant father had business there, and his               Bible-imbibing mother seized upon Italy as a worthy holiday destination.<sup>1</sup>               The contrast of an increasingly industrialized and gritty England               to the light-saturated splendor of the Italian buildings profoundly               influenced his ideas on industrialization and architecture. Thus,               the architecture of Italy played a major role in his life.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="hymowi_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/hymowi_3a.jpg" width="190" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></center></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="hymowi_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) <i>The Pass                     at Faido</i>, St. Gotthard Watercolor, point of brush, scratching                     out, over traces of pencil 12 x 18.5 inches (303 x 469 mm)                     Thaw Collection, The Pierpont Morgan Library Photography by                     David A.

Before John Ruskin's birth, his maternal               grandfather had committed suicide at home, probably by slitting               his throat. Two generations later, when Ruskin wanted to marry Euphemia               (&quot;Effie&quot;) Chalmers Gray, one of his mother's objections               to the match was that the proposed bride had grown up in this grandfather's               house. For Mrs. Ruskin, the hapless Effie was a walking memento               mori. The young woman's childhood house--built architecture--blurred               into a sad facet of personality.</p>            <p class="second"> Of course, much of Ruskin's renown rightfully stemmed               from his persuasive arguments on art and architecture. Mixing exterior               and interior, he brought &quot;the story of his own life&quot; to               this august commentary, lacing it with &quot;his upbringing, religious               doubts, emotional attachments, and bouts of madness.&quot;<sup>2</sup>               The Morgan notes that the 1849 publication of <i>The Seven Lamps               of Architecture</i> established Ruskin as &quot;a central figure               in the Gothic Revival movement.&quot; He persuasively argued that               when measured against the expressiveness of Gothic architecture               contemporary English buildings appeared dolefully deficient. Ruskin               lamented that: &quot;All that we do is small and mean...thin, and               wasted, and unsubstantial.&quot; By contrast, each ornament and               detail of Gothic architecture contained an allegory of nationalism               and identification.</p>            <p class="second">Excerpts of Ruskin's steely criticism are matched               by implication with evidence of his coldness toward his wife in               the Morgan's psychologically informed approach. &quot;Ruskin's Italy,               Ruskin's England&quot; suggests that the Magi-like adoration by               his parents, well into his adulthood, caused Ruskin's arrested development               and doomed him sexually. For example, he never consummated this               marriage to Effie.</p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="hymowi_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="gr/hymowi_4a.jpg" width="163" height="130" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></center></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="hymowi_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> John Everett Millais (1929-1896) <i>The Countess as                     Barber</i> Pen and brown ink on wove paper 7.3 x 9 inches                     (187 x 230 mm) Lettered by the artist at upper left, The Countess                     as Barber.

Tellingly, he described her na&iuml;ve charms as &quot;ineffable&quot;.               After ten years of infatuation, the forty-nine-year-old Ruskin horrified               the pious and sickly Rose with a declaration of his passion for               her. She refused his proposal of marriage and died not long after,               plunging her desperate suitor into an irremediable decline. An inconsolable               Ruskin incorporated roses into colophons for a series of 96 &quot;Letters               to the Workmen and Labourers of England,&quot; peculiarly mixing               tracts on social reform with the most private form of sentiment.<sup>3</sup></p>            <p class="second">The Morgan's psycho-biographical approach shadows               Ruskin's own critical work. These writings documented and were informed               by his personal reactions to landscape and to art. George P. Landow,               Brown University Professor of Art History and English, has noted               that in including &quot;his own experience&quot; when re-creating               a work of art in words, Ruskin was &quot;like the evangelical preacher               and the romantic poet,&quot;<sup>4</sup> both staples of the Victorian era.               Landow observes that Ruskin applied the syntax of sermons to form               an evangelical template for art criticism. The critic used the hortatory               conviction of the evangelical to promote the spiritually expressive               power of the art and architecture he admired.</p>            <p class="second">The Morgan does not take to the pulpit but rather               indirectly speaks of Ruskin's improprieties and perversions in its               efforts to redirect attention to Ruskin's greatness as a critic               of art and architecture and as a social reformer. In his recent               biography, <i>John Ruskin: The Later Years</i>, Tim Hilton suggests               more explicitly that the critic actively pursued social discourse               with young girls.<sup>5</sup> In her <i>New York Times</i> review of his book,               Valentine Cunningham calls Hilton's revelations &quot;an arresting               record of Ruskin's crippling obsession with little girls -- at schools               he endowed, in London parks, by the Italian wayside, in the studio               of the illustrator Kate Greenaway (he made up to her little models               with gifts of skipping ropes and magnetic fish).&quot;<sup>6</sup></p>            <p class="second">In his &quot;mentoring&quot; of Greenaway, the renowned               critic urged her to produce for him versions of her cottage-y little               girls with, as the Morgan text puts it, &quot;less clothing.&quot;               In one of a number of unselfconsciously perverse letters to Greenaway,               Ruskin wrote of a young model: &quot;Draw her for me without her               hat...and, without her shoes.&quot; It is possible that details               such as these were not substantiated in documents owned by the Morgan,               and for this reason do not surface in its exhibition.</p>            <p class="second">In the end, it does not seem that the Morgan has               attempted to hush up the dark side of John Ruskin so much as to               pay homage to the forces that made him what he was. Ruskin's ability               to train his eye on a landscape or a stone ornament or to be transfixed               by a little girl spoke to a singularity of purpose and a complexity               of vision emblematic of the Victorian age. While its title suggests               directionality, &quot;Ruskin's Italy, Ruskin's England,&quot; is               all about indirection, about sunlight and shadow, and that seems               in every way correct.</p>            <p class="second"><a href="hymowi_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="hymowi_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../gr/parthome.gif" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&copy;       2001 P<i>ART</i> and Ellen Hymowitz.
