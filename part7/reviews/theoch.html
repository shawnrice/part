As the author explains, <i>&quot;analyzing               the competing priorities and allegiances with regards to civic architecture               we can literally observe the building of a nation reflected in the               building of its institutions.&quot;</i> [p 148]. In exploring these               issues she discusses the often conflicting ideas of &quot;becoming               European&quot; while searching for &quot;Greekness&quot;. One of               the ways that architecture and urbanism contributed to the formation               of a new national character was by verifying the distance Greece               had moved away from the &quot;East&quot; (and particularly the Ottoman               past) by becoming all the more closer to an ideal or idealized &quot;West&quot;               (Europe). Bast&eacute;a demonstrates the ways that architecture               and urban planning became essential tools for the creation of an               often fragile sense of national identity and served as symbols of               national rebirth.<br>              <br>            </p>            <p class="second">In the first chapters, Bast&eacute;a guides us through               the complex political and diplomatic map of modern Greece while               also giving us a sense of the changes that were taking place within               Greek culture and society. Her succinct and comprehensive outline               of the major historical events is extremely successful in conveying               the main issues that ultimately became the background to urban developments.               Thus, we learn about the tensions between the Greeks and the Bavarians               who held key positions in the government in the first years of Otto's               reign. She also discusses the &quot;Great Idea&quot; or Greece's               dreams of enlarging its territory to the boundaries of the what               had been the Byzantine Empire. One objective of this plan was to               re-Hellenize Istanbul (Constantinople or &quot;The City&quot;),               the Empire's capital and seat of the Orthodox Patriarchite. More               directly connected to urbanization were the major public works initiated               by visionary Prime Minister Charilaos Trikoupis. His modernization               program included building roads, railway lines, harbors, bridges               and the opening of the Corinth Canal. Much of this infrastructure               was constructed in the last two decades of the nineteenth century.               Bast&eacute;a writes: &quot;Planning came to signify national progress.               In fact new buildings and streets were often the only bright spots               in the horizon --visible markers of progress and success [...] And               [...] the government initiated and controlled space, just as it               controlled the development of the Greek language, history and religion.&quot;               (p 43).</p>            <p class="second">Yet, this nation building project was not without               its conflicts and<br>              contradictions. Bast&eacute;a's study is made more compelling by               her exploration of these. Greeks felt they had to make a leap &quot;from               barbarity to civilization.&quot; This leap and the corresponding               desire to be identified with the West, was &quot;never monolithic               and uncontested&quot;. The author notes that &quot;many of the leading               Greek intellectuals, while usually trained in the West themselves,               cautioned against an indiscriminate and wholesale imitation of the               West; while <i>&quot;the Bavarians were criticized for assuming               Greece to be a tabula rasa.&quot;</i> (p 39). The author often interjects               her text with lively and evocative fragments from the contemporary               Athenian press. In fact, she uses the press as a key method of analysis               by noting the ways in which private citizens voiced their criticism               and even resistance to the official nation-building efforts. For               instance, she mentions the slightly ironic comment from the Athenian               newspaper &quot;Aion&quot; of 1858: <i>&quot;We have no ships, no               army, no roads, but soon we will have an Academy. Turkey, beware!&quot;</i>               [p 160]. This particular comment is indicative of the symbolic power               of the neoclassical architecture of the Academy building by Theophile               Hansen, as a marker of Greece's &quot;progress&quot; and to a so-called               return to her own past.<br>            </p>            <table width="89" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <center>                    <a href="theoch_2.html"><img src="gr/theoch_2a.jpg" width="196" height="120" border="0" alt="click to see larger view"></a></center></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth">                     <p><a href="theoch_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig 2:</b> Back                       cover image: P.

The years of Ottoman               oppression had disconnected the nineteenth century Greeks from their               ancient roots. Evidence of this condition was found in the condition               of early nineteenth century Athens, a decrepit town of ruins. Although               to us Athens may seem like the most appropriate site, it was not               everyone's first choice for a capital. In 1835 the newspaper Athena               lamented: &quot;To tell the truth, the seat of the Greek state does               not at all differ from an African or a Turkish city.&quot; (P 11)               That Athens was eventually chosen as the capital may be indicative               of both European political influence and the conceptual power of               the romantic movement of &quot;philhellenism.&quot;<sup>1</sup>               On the advice of his father King Ludwig I of Bavaria, the young               Prince Frederick Otto of Wittelsbach was crowned the first King               of the Hellenes in Athens in December 1834. He immediately began               to turn the small provincial city of 6,000 inhabitants into a new               and glorious capital. He wanted to see its classical past reborn               or &quot;revived&quot; along with the birth of the new state.</p>            <p class="second">Thus, a sense of national pride was awakened by               the creation of the first &quot;neoclassical&quot; public buildings               (Royal Palace, Academy, National Library, University, Archaeological               Museum, the Arsakion School) that appeared in Athens soon after               Otto's ascent to the throne. The issue of neoclassical architecture               as it was introduced by the Germans or German- educated architects               during the early years of the Greek state was an ideologically loaded               one. Bast&eacute;a does not fully explore the strange conceptual               back and forth between German and Greek culture as it was expressed               through the medium of architecture. She concentrates instead on               providing much needed but primarily descriptive analysis of the               main projects and protagonists of the development of modern Athens.</p>            <p class="second">Another approach would have paid more attention               to the processes of identification and desire not only on the part               of the Greeks towards the &quot;Europeans&quot; but also of the               Europeans, particularly the Germans, to be identified culturally               with classical Greece. Whereas Greece had been physically colonized               by a mighty Eastern empire, in the nineteenth century the Europeans               were colonizing the memory of classical Greece. This sentiment was               succinctly expressed by Wilhelm von Humboldt, Prussian patron of               the arts, philologist and politician, when he proclaimed: <i>&quot;in               the Greeks alone we find the ideal of that which we ourselves should               like to be and produce [...] They move us not with compulsion to               be more like them but with inspiration to be more ourselves&quot;</i><sup>2</sup>.               In turn, during the early years of the Greek state, Greek architects               and patrons were only too happy to uncritically accept a European               interpretation of classical Greece as their own rightful heritage.               Therefore, it is somewhat disappointing that Bast&eacute;a does               not introduce the concept of colonial studies. </p>            <p class="second">Bast&eacute;a gives a valuable and richly documented               account of public life and monuments and their role in the establishment               of Greek national identity. But her book would have greatly benefited               from a larger contextualization of the Greek examples. For instance,               why does Bast&eacute;a propose in her study of &quot;Modern Athens&quot;               that &quot;the broader questions of modernity and modernism fall               largely outside the territory of this study&quot;? [P 188] Perhaps               this is due to lack of space. In addition, there are several new               works of literature, politics and psychoanalysis that focus particularly               on Greece and explore questions of cultural identity. This attests               to the richness of this field as a topic of investigation and some               of these could have enriched Bastea's more specifically architectural               study. Two that cover similar ground with very different emphases               are Artemis Leontis' <i>Topographies of Hellenism. Mapping the Homeland</i>               (1995) and Stathis Gourgouris' <i>Dream Nation: Enlightenment, Colonization               and the Institution of Modern Greece</i> (1996).</p>            <p class="second"> Still, &quot;The Creation of Modern Athens: Planning               The Myth&quot; is a truly insightful work. It is also a necessary               book for any scholar of modern Greece and nineteenth century European               architecture and urbanism. Bast&eacute;a's well-documented study               is a significant contribution to the still underesearched topic               of the architectural culture of modern Greece.</p>            <p class="second"><a href="theoch_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a>             <p><font class="second"><a href="theoch_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>              &nbsp;           </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../index.html"><img src="../gr/parthome.gif" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&copy;       2001 P<i>ART</i> and Ioanna Theocharopoulou.
