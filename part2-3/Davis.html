Angeline</FONT COLOR></FONT></TT><P> <TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>    Stuart Davis (1892-1964) has long been regarded as one of the most important American artists of the 20th century. He made a career out of assimilating various styles and concepts into his own personal arsenal of images and painterly devices, and most surveys of his oeuvre show an appreciation for the many stylistic shifts he underwent. He is equally respected for the almost heroic solitary figure he epitomized at times when modernism in this country was an all but forgotten movement. One of the most crucial set of paintings he executed was called the Egg Beater series, whose compositional and structural breakthroughs were so important to the artist that he once remarked to James Johnson Sweeney, "You may say that everything I have done since has been based on that eggbeater idea."<P>These works, executed in 1927-28, are paintings of abstract shapes, lines and planes that interact with one another in complex ways, and are invariably described in the literature as being cubist derived: Diane Kelder has called the Egg Beaters "the climax of Davis' efforts to master Cubist structure"<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#2"> <font size="1">2</font size></A> and Louis Kachur has written that Davis "had already proved himself an accomplished cubist with his recently completed Egg Beater series,"<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#3"> <font size="1">3</font size></A> just to cite two recent examples. Furthermore, William C. Agee has carefully traced the entrenchment of cubism's lessons in Davis' art in his essay on Davis during 1922-24. <P><IMG SRC="EGGBEATER.jpg" border="0"><P>Yet Ruth Bohan has suggested an alternative inspiration this seminal series of Davis'. Bohan proposes that Davis found a catalyst in the works of El Lissitzky, whose paintings he saw at the 1926 survey of modern art that was organized by the Societe  Anonyme and held at the Brooklyn Museum.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#4"><font size="1">4</font size></A> While an in-depth study of Davis' series was not the goal of Bohan's nor entirely appropriate in the context of her study of the exhibition, there are enough substantial clues for a careful consideration of the possibility. Indeed it is quite odd that in the more than ten years since Bohan's book was published, no Davis scholar has been interested in bearing out or disproving her postulate, one which offers a completely new interpretation of the central body of work of one of the greatest American modernists. One which furthermore opens up the range of influences upon Davis to far beyond the incessantly evoked School of Paris. This paper is engaged in such an enquiry and there seem to be many good reasons to believe that in constructing his <I>Egg Beaters</I> Davis did rely upon Lissitzky as a main inspiration; furthermore it is clear that Davis' awareness of Lissitzky initially came from one source--the 1926 Brooklyn Exhibition and its organizer, Katherine Dreier.<P>To begin with, a brief outline of Davis' career is in order. Davis, the son of artist parents (his father was an art director, his mother a sculptor), dropped out of high school to study art at Robert Henri's school, where he stayed from 1909-1912. Although at times in later years Davis would distance himself from some of the more restrictive aspects of Henri and his Ashcan School peers, he always made it clear that he valued Henri's tutelage, especially the focus on direct experience and the placing high value on an artist's ability to assimilate his environment, from high culture to the mundane or disreputable. His association with artists like John Sloan led to his being a cartoonist for the radical periodical  <I>The Masses,</I> until a dispute over artistic control led to his and the publication's parting of ways in 1916. He continued to struggle for years as a painter, involving himself along the way with projects such as designing the interior of a  ewark ice cream parlor in 1921<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#5"><font size="1">5</font size></A> and textiles, working under the auspices of the WPA, and engaging himself in the activities of various artist/activist groups of the 1930's and 40's like the American Artists' Congress. In addition to his painting and design work Davis was a productive writer, from magazine articles to public letters to group manifestoes.  Often in articles and interviews Davis would remark upon formative moments in his development, or he would be asked about key events at which he was present. Among these are his trips to Cuba (1920), New Mexico (1923), and Paris (1928), although at one point or another he would play down any great importance they had on his art. In New York he was first inspired and to a certain extent guided by Henri and the Ashcan School, but then he attended the 1913 Armory Show--in which he was represented--and he is often quoted as having said that this set him on the road to becoming a "modernist."However another exhibition of modern art which was just as important for Davis (if not more so) as the Armory Show, one in which Davis was also included, and one which clearly stimulated his creativeimagination is also one which is rarely if ever invoked by people writing about Davis: the 1926 Exhibition of Modern Art held at the Brooklyn Museum and organized by the Societe  Anonyme's president,Katherine Dreier.   <P>Katherine Sophie Dreier was born into a prominent Brooklyn family in 1877. Dreier's father, Theodore, had amassed a modest fortune in an iron importing business. Years later Katherine would thank him for "the vision he firmly held to, ahead of his time, of giving the same  'privilege to his daughters as he gave to his son." <A HREF="Davisnotes.html#6"><font size="1">6</font size></A>  Among the privileges conferred by the Dreiers to their children was the opportunity for education and with it an unshakable sense of civic commitment. In 1916 Dreier became a member of the Board of Trustees for the Society of Independent Artists and helped organize their massive 1917 exhibition at Grand Central Palace. It was through thisexhibition that she first made the acquaintance of Marcel Duchamp, who was involved in an internal argument with the group over their reaction to his readymade piece entitled <I>Fountain.</I> Although Dreier was among those who initially opposed the inclusion of <I>Fountain</I>, she later came to appreciate Duchamp's intentions. They struck up a friendship that would last until Dreier's death, and he introduced her to the circle of New York Dadaists which found its home in the circle of Walter Arensberg.<P>     In 1920 Dreier and Duchamp decided to form a new institution for the support of modern artists and the education of the general public.  Duchamp invited Man Ray to help them found the new group, although apart from some interesting photographs Ray's involvement was largely inconsequential. Still, Man Ray is credited with the name Societe Anonyme, which Dreier responded warmly to, relating the name to her concern with "art, not personalities." What Dreier did not initially realize was that <I>societe anonyme</I>is French for "incorporated," and thatthe name "Societe Anonyme, Inc." is a typical Dada wordgame, translating into "Incorporated, Inc." <P>   The watershed event in the Societe's history came in 1926 with its International Exhibition of Modern Art held at the Brooklyn Museum.  The title was lifted from the 1913 Armory Show, in which Dreier was represented by two paintings, and in its scope it rivalled the 1917  'Society of Independent Artists exhibition.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#7"><font size="1">7</font size></A> In addition to being a well-curated and highly attended exhibition of global modernism during a relatively quiet spell in America for such things, the Brooklyn exhibition also made deliberate attempts to affect people in a more lasting manner. Dreier had four galleries in the exhibition made up to resemble rooms in a house to illustrate how modern art could and shouldreadily integrate into an everyday domestic environment, and there was also a prototype of a "television room," designed in conjunction with Frederick Kiesler, which would make any house or museum a worldwidemuseum of art by illuminating different slides of masterpieces with the  'turn of a knob.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#8"><font size="1">8</font size></A>  Concurrent with the exhibition the Societe  sponsored eighteen lectures, fourteen of which were delivered by Dreier herself. <P>    Opened on November 18, the Brooklyn exhibition featured 308 works by 106 artists from 23 countries and attracted over 52,000 visitors in seven weeks. One of those visitors was Davis, who was also representedin the exhibition by his 1925  <I>Still Life With Super Table.</I>  Davis was included in the exhibition after writing to Dreier.  Dreier, like Davis himself, was a proselytizer for international modernism at a moment in American history when almost no one else was interested. She and Davis had both shown their artwork in the Armory Show and knew some of the same people but apparently had never become acquainted with one another. At the time when Drier was planning the Brooklyn exhibition there had not been a survey of modern art on such ascale since at least the 1917 Independent Show. Davis' excitement over the prospect of being in such an exhibition is evident in a letter he wrote to Dreier: "Burliuk saw my work and said I should be in the show.I would like very much to be a member of the Societe and will do  'anything you may suggest to make it possible..."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#9"><font size="1">9</font size></A> Even if his tone was somewhat overly polite and solicitous, the genuine feeling of interestand desire to be included is apparent. Dreier responded warmly to  'Davis, telling him she had followed his work for years<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#10"><font size="1">10</font size></A>, and later upon seeing his painting wrote "I was delighted when I saw your picture  'and...I shall, of course, exhibit it."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#11"><font size="1">11</font size></A><P>The exhibition, which was accompanied by a catalogue and a lectureseries, was by many accounts a successful affair. It was the firstintroduction in this country of Surrealism and offerred a much largersampling of Soviet and German (and simply non-French) modernism thanwas the norm in America at the time or had been included in the ArmoryShow (which had included out of the German school only one Kandinsky,one Kirchner, and two Lehmbruck sculptures, and out of the Russiansonly Archipenko was included). Davis was forthright in his praise for  the exhibition, writing that "the exhibition itself was an inspiration to me and has given me a fresh impulse."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#12"><font size="1">12</font size></A>  By this point Davis and Dreier seem to have struck up a friendship, inviting one another over for discussions when they were both in Manhattan, and Davis offerred his services to the Societe . Indeed, Davis did not stop commenting onthe Brooklyn show after it had left the museum. All participatingartists were given a complementary copy of the catalogue and Davis seems to have made use of his. He wrote to Dreier "Looking through the catalogue has been a very stimulating experience. I have gotten morefrom the catalogue than from the exhibition itself owing to theunderstanding that comes with familiarity. It would interest me verymuch to see more reproductions of the constructionist [sic] school,Lissitzky, etc..." out of 106 artists Lissitzky is the only name hesingles out, and he then continues: "Inquiry at the stores where artbooks are sold failed to produce any and so I thought I might be ableto see some in your library. I would also like to talk to you about art and living conditions in Germany. It is possible I may go there."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#13"><font size="1">13</font size></A><P>While there is no record of what books Dreier might have lent toDavis, the two seem to have had discussions about art. Since Dreierwas fresh from closing the Brooklyn exhibition (which had travelled toManhattan, Buffalo and Toronto) and had acquired some Lissitzky worksfor the Societe  she was definitely prepared to answer most of Davis'questions. Furthermore she was preparing an exhibition of Lissitzkyand Schwitters for 1928, and was actually corresponding with both Lissitzky and his wife, Sophie Kuppers. Although this exhibition never took place, Dreier had maintained a strong appreciation for Russianmodernism since 1922 when she visited the <I>Erste RussicheKunstausstellung</I> in Berlin. Although she and Lissitzky never met,their correspondence was certainly warm, and Dreier would furthermoresupply Lissitzky with sports magazines and other graphic material which reflected American culture to him.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#14"><font size="1">14</font size></A><P>Given the amount of information that Dreier was able to supply(knowledge virtually no other of their peers was capable of imparting)Davis must surely have been excited by the many parallels betweenhimself and the Russian artist. Both men were among the pioneeringmodernists of their time. Both lived socially committed,anti-bourgeois lives in which they turned to serious art study andpractice as teenagers. They both wrote prolifically and helped toorganize artist groups and exhibitions, yet their art was often purelyabstract and non¬ narrative. Both men were primarily painters whoworked in other media including design (Davis, who supported himselffor a time as a commercial artist had designed a cafe interior and some limited edition publications<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#15"><font size="1">15</font size></A> as well as textiles; Lissitzky, who at times supported himself doing ad work, designed exhibition spaces andgraphic projects, and was one of the principle innovators of modern typography and photomontage).  And both were clearly willing to look to sources outside of the too-often cited Parisian ones: Davisexpressed an interest to Dreier in visiting Germany (according to hisinterview with Harlan Phillips he had studied German in high schoolwhereas he knew no French) and Lissitzky was a frequent dweller in that country.The main examples of Lissitzky's work that Davis was exposed towere his Prounen. This series of calculatedly arranged architectonicabstract shapes was executed by Lissitzky from 1919 to 1924. The wordProun has been given some differing interpretations but the standardseems to have been as an acronym for <I>PROjekty Utverzhdeniya Novogo  'Projects for the Affirmation for the New.</I><A HREF="Davisnotes.html#16"><font size="1">16</font size></A> These works took the pure, reduced geometric shapes that were produced in the Russian Suprematistmovement and gave them an ambiguous materiality and broader set of applications. Sophie Kuppers has described the Prounen as follows: "There, within the confines of the picture-frame, was cosmic space, in which floating geometric forms were held counterpoised by tremendous tensile forces,"<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#17"><font size="1">17</font size></A> and mentions that Lissitzky regarded them as "the interchange...between painting and architecture. "<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#18"><font size="1">18</font size></A> Many of these concepts find their reflection in Davis' treatment of the <I>Egg Beaters</I>. John Lane has discussed this series in terms of "the forging a harmonious relationship between the geometric planes representing subject matter transferred to a flat surface."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#19"><font size="1">19</font size></A> <P> James Johnson Sweeney presents them as "an invented series of planes which was interesting to the artist." And in relation to Lissitzky's and Kuppers' discussion of "cosmic" ( in other words, nonmaterial or somewhat abstract) architecture, Davis himself wrote that "the interior of the shapes consisted of houses, trees, and sky, much as they appeared in nature."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#20"><font size="1">20</font size></A> <P>And both artists were essentially concerned with a new constructed spatiality, as is evident in the following statements ``Proun goes beyond painting and the artist on the one hand and the machine and the engineer on the other, and it advances to the construction of space, divides it by the elements of all dimensions, and creates a new, multi-faceted unity as a final representation of our nature. <A HREF="Davisnotes.html#21"><font size="1">21</font size></A><P>By DRAWING I mean following the contours of planes. Interesting work must be a drawing. The fact that with the rectangle of the canvas you have DRAWN already a plane at right angles to the lines of sight. The DRAWING of the large planes of your subject must bear an understandable spatial relation to the plane of the canvas, thus--the DRAWING is the contour of a cubical space visualized as an ideal unit by the artist.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#22"><font size="1">22</font size></A>  In such writings and others like them each artist has laid out a somewhat obscure yet extremely compatible system of reconstructed  space, reconfigured subjects, machine aesthetics and angular geometric forms with which to put forth their artistic message. Furthermore, both emphasize the confines of the rectangular canvas even as they attempt to subvert it.<P>The similarity between Davis' and Lissitzky's two series extendsbeyond overlapping theories. One need only to examine some examplesfrom each series to see the relationship. While there were sevenpaintings by Lissitzky in the Brooklyn exhibition- <I> LN 31, Proun 2PR,Proun 99, el Proun 97, W.B. Proun 98, Proun 100,</I> and  <I>Proun 95</I> therewas only one reproduced in the catalogue that Davis continued toexamine-- <I>Proun 99</I> [Fig 1]. This painting is both highly ephemeral withits nonrepresentational floating forms and materialistically groundedwith its silver and black paint and perspectival grid. Yet standardconventions of dimensionality are subverted, as in the fact that thediagonals of the grid do not converge as they should in trueRenaissance perspective and the cube has been observed as having a"dual appearance as either a solid with one point toward the viewer or a hollow with a receding corner."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#23"><font size="1">23</font size></A> These blocky forms are complemented by thin wiry lines which change color depending upon their background. Many of the same things could be said, for example, about <I>Egg Beater No. 1 [Fig. 2] </I>or  No. 4, with their large diagonal planes which seem to inscribe a new space yet bear no true perspectivalrelation with the rest of the created spaces. Furthermore, thesepaintings also contain thin wiry lines that change colors given theground they are placed upon.  Likewise, in <I>Egg Beater No. 3</I> [Fig. 3]the lines on the left of the composition could alternately be inscribing a receding square or an advancing one, just like Lissitzky's ambiguous cube.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#24"><font size="1">24</font size></A>  The sharp faceting and transparency of planes in the <I>Egg Beaters</I> also have equivalents in works like Lissitzky's <I>LN 31</I> [Fig. 4] with its suggestion of glass forms. A survey of Lissitzky's works that were either owned by Dreier or are clearly related to hers bearsout the same structural and coloristic affinities that the abovecomparisons do, including the use of simplified pure hues, thesuggestion of architecture, and an emphasis on diagonal thrusts andGiven the textual, theoretical, and visual evidence whichindicates just how closely Davis was involved in Lissitzky's project weare left with a fairly obvious question: why has this never beendiscussed before Bohan nor explored after her? It would seem that theanswer to this question has two parts. In the first place, Davis didnot ever cite Lissitzky, or Soviet or German modernism as an influencein any of his writings, interviews, or biographical sketches. This ofcourse does not mean that they did not exist, and hopefully we have bynow established that they did. Very often an artist will edit his orher recollections and statements to create or help streamline his orher personal mythos. There is no perfectly evident reason why Daviswould choose to downplay Lissitzky and Dreier, although somepossibilities may include his desire to distance himself from Communismin the late 1930's and 40's, and the nefarious (and decidedlyanti-American) taint that Germany would soon acquire after the electionof the national Socialists in 1933. Part of the Davis mythos is hisquintessential Americaness, and while this did not preclude involving Paris in the narrative, it has always been acceptable--in fact, almost<I>de rigueur</I>--for early American modernists to establish their ties to the Parisian avant-garde.<P> The other reason for ignoring a non-French influence is, as hasbeen alluded to, the dominant role that the Parisian School has enjoyedin the history of modernism (a privilege that still largely continuesto this day, as the permanent collection galleries at the Museum ofModern Art attest to). Nevertheless,there are some examples ofhistorians--and Davis himself--downplaying the role of cubism in the<I>Egg Beaters</I>. It is true that as early as when they were first shownsome reviewers were issuing statements like "old fashioned group of   'Cubist pictures" to discuss the series,<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#25"><font size="1">25</font size></A> but others were not so quick to label: They did not seem to be cubism, nor did they seem to fall, either, in the category of sur-realisme."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#26"><font size="1">26</font size></A><P> In 1930 Davis wrote an angry letter of rebuttal to Henry McBride who had earlier suggested that had Picasso never lived, Davis would have had to think out his own style,asking "Now is that nice, Mr. McBride?" and questioning both the dominance of Paris and the concept of a pure American art (the regionalists, to Davis, did not qualify). <A HREF="Davisnotes.html#27"><font size="1">27</font size></A> And Karen Wilkin has recently noted that "The similarity between the Egg Beaters andPicasso's works of the late 1920's has often been noted. Davis, likemany of his contemporaries, paid close attention to Picasso, but knewhis work chiefly from reproductions. Picasso's pictures of this typewere not shown in New York until Davis was well into the Egg Beater series."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#28"><font size="1">28</font size></A> Furthermore, the Picasso works that most clearly relate, like <I>The Studio</I> of 1928, were not really reproduced until such periodicals like the Cahiers d'Art showed them in 1929. In short, it seems that sometimes cubism was simply used as an easy label, a sort of paradigm for all modernism (as it is sometimes used by the general public todayand as Davis himself used it when trying to clear his paintings throughParis customs in 1928, according to the Phillips interview) and all thesubsequent literature from 1928 until the present never chose toclosely examine this classification. Indeed, Davis even showed some ofthe linear, planar tendencies of the <I>Egg Beaters</I> in earlier works like<I>Super Table</I> of 1925 and Percolator and Matches of 1927 [Fig. 11-13].The latter two came after the influence of the Brooklyn show but even the earlier painting comes after Lissitzky had been shown by Dreier in New York in 1924.<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#29"><font size="1">29</font size></A><P>This paper was not attempting to remove all traces of Picasso andcubism from Davis' <I>oeuvre,</I> nor was it attempting to posit El Lissitzkyand Soviet art as Davis' only inspiration. To do so would be to ignorethe very versatility and inventiveness that is a chief characteristicof the artist's entire output and to deny the inquisitive nature andassimilative facility that were main features of the man's disposition.Wilkin has written that "the variousness of the 1920's is proof thatthese were still formative years, but they were also among the most eventful, professionally and personally, in his long career."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#30"><font size="1">30</font size></A>  Davis himself wrote "I did not spring into this world fully equipped to paint the kind of picture I want to paint."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#31"><font size="1">31</font size></A> As Agee has written, "It is typical of Davis and one of the measures of his greatness that once he absorbed the lesson of each mode, he was quick to realize its limitations and moved on to more demanding pictorial challenges."<A HREF="Davisnotes.html#32"><font size="1">32</font size></A><P>By 1927 Davis had been actively immersed in cubist explorations for at least five years and it is not hard to imagine him ready to move on to newer, fresher, inspirations. During this time of rabid exploration he seized upon a new kind of art that he was able to both view firsthand and discuss at length thanks to Katherine Dreier, and the result was the central series of paintings in his long career, a series that marked his first complete leap into abstraction and whose structural lessons he would take with him to Paris and would return to in later paintings.<P></TD> <TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD> Nor is the suggestion that Davis merely imitated Lissitzky beingmade. Davis had constantly proved himself able to explore, assimilate,and then modify (he might have said improve) the examples set forth byothers. After exploring the facts and making comparisons of both theartists' works and their similar attitudes, a recognition of the rolethat El Lissitzky played in the <I>Egg Beaters</I> of Stuart Davis isunavoidable. Furthermore, the absolutely essential role that KatherineDreier played can not be ignored. She managed to connect two disparateartists who never met one another, and through her efforts--bothcuratorial and pedagogical--helped to dramatically alter the course ofone of America's most important artists and set him on the path of hismature style.</TD> <TD><A HREF="p2contents.html"><IMG SRC="contentlogo.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT border="0"></A></TD> </TR> </TABLE></BODY></HTML>
