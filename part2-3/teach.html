This keeps me at the school from the morning untilthe late evening.The daytime student body at BMCC differs a great deal from evening and night classes.  Day classes contain mostly younger 18-to-21-year olds, who can be particularlydifficult to teach.  I have found that they are less motivated than the older students in my evening classes, who tend to bemore responsible.  These students are much moremotivated and tend to do better all around handing intheir assignments on time, and completing them morecarefully.<BR>  <BR>  The evening students have different problems.  There are a lot more foreignstudents among them who lack the language skills tounderstand what is being said in the classroom and givenin the form of written directions.  Thus, the youngergroups during the day could present behavioral ormotivational problems and the evening classes language orother difficulties.  Of course, present in both to somedegree is a combination of these challenges.<BR>  <BR>  Teaching at BMCC has taught me to appreciate aspects of my life skills that I previously undervalued. For example, the fact that I am a woman and have been amother has helped me a lot in dealing with youngerstudents towards whom I feel a great responsibility andwho I try to motivate.  Having had two children, an olderboy and a girl two years younger, I have learned throughmy mistakes.  I drove my son so hard that I took away hismotivation and eventually he dropped out of college (muchlater he returned of his own volition).  I learned torelax my vigilance somewhat with my daughter and hadbetter results; she is now a teacher herself.  <BR>  <BR>  The lesson I took from this experience is to provide thestudents with the available pathways for help, request anassignment, and then allow them to exercise theiroptions.  Tolerance in permitting the students to redotheir papers if the grade is unsatisfactory is essential. I attach a preprinted and checked-off sheet to the gradedpaper, identifying the problem areas and where to go forhelp in redoing the assignment, as well as the date it isdue back.  In this way the English-as-Second- Language students can rewrite theassignment with the help of a school tutor, as can thestudent who has problems with grammar and style in thewriting workshop.  Those pupils who have gottenundesirable grades because they did not follow directions need to be addressed personally and giventhe guidelines more explicitly.<BR>  <BR>  One of the most difficult tasks I have had was how to ensure that the students do theirassigned readings.  Surprise quizzes was one way, theother was to initiate student presentations.  I dividedthe class into small groups.  Each group was thenassigned a particular topic to present to the class. Thus after lecturing myself the first 40 minutes of eachsession, I had each student present one slide or oneartist assigned to him/her the previous week.  I asked thatthey read the text on the topic and present the materialto the class in their own words without reading fromnotes.  Stress was placed on content rather than the styleof presentation, thus assuring a less self-conscious,less performance-oriented delivery.<BR>  <BR>  I was astonished by the high quality of these sessions. My joy at the assured manner with which the studentsappropriated my role was great.  After going up to thescreen and requesting my pointer the student wouldproceed to address the image at hand.  Pointing to thecharacteristics which identified the art work, eachstudent expounded on what he/she had learned from Janson,adding his/her own interpretations about the subject. The presentation model has helped the students make the material their own by formulating an educated opinion and critically evaluating what they haveread.  They need to read for fullunderstanding, and be responsible for their group andthe class's comprehension of the material through theirclarification.  The resulting grades were overall higherthan lecture classes on the sametopics I had taught previously.</TD><TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD><BR>  <BR>  Subsequently I asked that an anonymous questionnaire be answered by my students about the viability of this type of teaching technique.  Overall the answers were positive and confirmed my reasons for instituting this method.  99% answered that because of the presentations they read more than they were assigned and met with their groups outside the classroom.  They also studied for examinations with the same groups and felt that they did much better as a result.</TD><TD><A HREF="p3cont.html#PRACTICE"><IMG SRC="content.jpg" BORDER=0  ALIGN=RIGHT></A></TD></TR></TABLE>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>
