In RAJ&Eacute;:A Superhero. The Beginning of a New Bold Era, Cox takes up some issueswhich she previously addressed in her series, Yo Mama. These large cibachromeprints present Cox in the guise of RAJ&Eacute;, an in-your-face-female superherothat puts Wonder Woman to shame, honey. Complete with her own 11 1/2 inchfashion doll and music video, RAJ&Eacute; is a state-of-the-art superhero whosehype is as much about her labors as it is about her image.&nbsp;<P>In her first one woman show, Ren&eacute;e Cox presents the spectatorwith highly-saturated glossy images which evoke an aesthetic of magazinesand motion pictures. Featuring the artist herself as RAJ&Eacute;, we see the actionfemme featured in various moments of iconic heroism: breaking steel chainsin front of an erupting volcano, standing like the 50-foot-woman over acab in Times Square, poised with two muscular male sidekicks on the globejust above the African continent. Arguably, the show's centerpiece is TheLiberation of UB and Lady J. Here, RAJ&Eacute; is featured between a young manand woman, both scantily clad, as she pulls them towards safety away fromthe giant Uncle Ben's converted rice and Aunt Jemima maple syrup labelsin the background. The liberation from these servile images is underscoredby the contrast of their strong, healthy bodies, viewed full-size, to thealways-smiling, fragmented faces on the labels.&nbsp;</TD><TD><ALIGN=RIGHT><IMG SRC="cox.jpg" BORDER=0 ><P><FONT SIZE=-2>(Burning, 1998, Cibachrome)</FONT></ALIGN></TD></TR><TR><TD>Cox uses a Christie doll (Mattel's Black Barbie doll) to create herown action superhero/fashion doll. Dressed in a miniature version of herown African-pride uniform which features red, gold, green and black, theRAJ&Eacute; doll is faithful to the original hero, complete with long dreadlockswoven into her hair.&nbsp;<P>RAJE emblematizes Cox's agenda, created in visually palatable terms.Subverting both race and gender stereotypes and battling patriarchy andsocial injustice the world over, RAJ&Eacute; is the quintessential superhero.Conceivably, she has come at the end of the 20th century to save the worldfrom such evils as imperialism, machismo, racism, Proposition 187-typeideology, government cuts in education and social programs and the endof affirmative action.&nbsp;<P>In the wake of Pop Art and the post-Pop Koonsian aesthetic, Cox bringsto the table not only the color and kitsch-sensibility of these predecessorsbut also the contemplative aesthetic of Lorna Simpson, Rotimi Fani-Kayodeand even Lyle Ashton Harris, particularly in terms of the body. The restis pure glam. These slick, color-laden images, their large format and Cox'sown powerfully beautiful figure heighten the visual impact of the work,making Cox's politics clear and engaging.&nbsp;<P>Ren&eacute;e Cox's work has been widely exhibited in such venues asthe Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art,the Armand Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and the Institute of ContemporaryArt in Boston among others. This body of work marks her place among themost creative contemporary artists working today.&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="p3cont.html#REVIEWS"><IMG SRC="content.jpg" BORDER=0  ALIGN=RIGHT></A></TD></TR></TABLE>&nbsp;<P><A HREF="p3cont.html#REVIEWS"><IMG SRC="content.jpg" BORDER=0  ALIGN=RIGHT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="p3.gif" BORDER=0 ></BODY></HTML>
