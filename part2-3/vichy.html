During the war, Flitterman-Lewis said, ``Everyday thinking in 1940'sFrance led to normalized complicity in the deportation of Jewish familiesand the persistent invisibility of everything surrounding Jewish life inFrench society.''&nbsp;<P>Presentations covered a range of perspectives with an emphasison the lives of children. Personal memoirsor the daily impressions of ordinary French citizens were treated with the same attentionas the more technical discussions of laws and institutionals,but I was more interested in the role the arts played during this period. What role did the arts play in normalizingthe dominant ideology?&nbsp;<P>The conference began with Professor Richard Weisberg (Benjamin Cardozo School of Law), who provided a comprehensiveand devastating account of the French legal system's complicity with Hitler's genocidal campaign during the dark period known as Vichy.&nbsp;<P>As in Germany, the exclusionary laws passed under Vichy ruleformalized institutional anti-semitism. Rosemarie Scullion (University of Iowa) discussed the work of the novelist and Nazisympathizer, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, who, while recognized along withProust as one of France’s greatest 20th century modernists, engenderedand reinforced a type of racist thinking that resulted in the massacre ofinnocents during this period. Celine already had an important public presence,and his feelings on race published in documents and pamphlets had a substantialsocial impact.&nbsp;<P>The role of music during the Vichy period was discussed by the composerand musician Alicia Svigals. The French film <i>Le Voile Bleu</i>, a popular melodramadirected by Jean Stelli and Francois Campeaux, was screened and discussed. The 1942 film is ostensibly about a woman who devotesher life to caring for children, but the film revealed the wayideology was casually but consistently presented to the French kindergarten-agedchildren. The second day of presentations included Philip Orenstein (Rutgers), David Slavin,(University of Georgia); Rosette C. Lamont (Sarah Lawrence College); Steven Jaron (St. Lawrence University), and Renee Roth-Hano (School of Social Work, NYU).Slavin addressed the issue of AlgerianJews and their instantaneous statelessness once the anti-semitic laws werepassed under the Vichy regime. Lamont showed how Charlotte Delbo, a non-Jew,had the moral courage to stand up to the German authorities. Orensteinand Roth-Hano related their personal experiences as children hidden inChristian homes or churches. Jaron spoke on the writings of GeorgesPerec and Sarah Kofman. Consistently brought out in all the presentationswas the effectiveness with which text, language, or visual depiction couldconvey the message of anti-semitism.&nbsp;<P>No heady ideas were used; the propaganda campaign concentrated on thebasic fundamental needs of people. Posters declared work, country and familyas moral pillars of the Vichy government. The idea of maternal love wasa popular theme in film and posters, extolling the role of motherhood forwomen while at the same time disallowing young Jewish girls from playingwith dolls. Mother's Day was a big event even as thousands of young Jewishchildren were being separated from their families and sent to deportationcamps. A slogan from a 1941 poster, ``Jews Must Be Swept Away to Make the House Clean,''led to the ideas of expulsion and removal and ultimately tothink of Jews in nonhuman terms.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</TD><TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD>Another poster read, ``Are You More French than He?'' The implication wasthat unless you could prove your Frenchness, you would be denied humanrights. You were impure and needed to be expunged. Ideology became manifestas these anti-semitic feelings became normalized.</TD><TD><A HREF="p3cont.html#REVIEWS"><IMG SRC="content.jpg" BORDER=0  ALIGN=RIGHT></A></TD></TR></TABLE>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>
