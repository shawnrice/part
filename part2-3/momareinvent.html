But according to what logic do art andarchitecture begin formally responding to one another? Is therenot some invisible force that prompts this material tug-of-war? <P>     Space seems to be at the root of all this, for both themuseum's art and architecture occupy the same institutionalspace: the former being placed within that space, the latterstructurally and ideologically defining it.  By using space as amedium, though, art since Minimalism is often created tocontaminate this space, to resist ontological reconfiguration bybreaking out of the self-enclosed frame of much modern art intothe room, the hall, the space that is the museum. By sometimesoverwhelming this space and forcing viewers to bodily experiencethe work-environment, many works enjoy a sense of liberation,albeit a false one.  For the shattering of the modernist frame isimmediately greeted by the imposition of another frame, the ever-pliant frame of institutional architecture -- one that, as Lowrysaid, must respond to changes in artistic practice. And thislogic, whereby liberation is met by domination, is the logic of latecapitalism, what Ernst Mandel has named our current, all-pervasive economic phase.  <P>     Late capitalism colonizes every last vestige of traditional,non-commodified space.  And the Western corporate museum isfirst and foremost an agent of late capitalism, functioning according toits logic.  What is reinventing the museum, then, is not TerrenceRiley or the MoMA trustees, nor is it Serra and his gargantuanworks, but rather the logic of late capitalism just as it doesevery other Western institution, moving them according to itsever-changing needs. Economic forces, then, prompt art andarchitecture to vie for power. Within the museum this logicmotivates architecture to adjust itself to artistic subversion,colonizing, containing, and disciplining it to conform to itsfirst-world outlook.  <P>     But what does all this mean? And where will it end?  Willthe Museum of Modern Art continue to eat Manhattan as the artworks get bigger? Orwill it just create international branches &#225 la Krens?  If thecolonization of space as dictated by late capitalism isrecognized as a historical inevitability, and if it is historicized,then maybe museum expansion might be seen not as an opportunityto show more works simultaneously and more appropriately, but asendangering artistic freedom of speech.  Peter B&#252rger notes: <BLOCKQUOTE><I>         Art in bourgeois society lives off the          tension between the institutional framework          (releasing art from the demand that it          fulfill a social function) and the possible          political content of individual works.  This          tension, however, is not stable but subject          to a historical dynamics that tends toward          its abolition.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE><P></TD> <TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD>          So what is being advocated here is not the preclusion of museumexpansion, but simply the understanding of its logic in order toprevent the effacement of an art work's political consciousness. </TD> <TD><A HREF="p2contents.html"><IMG SRC="contentlogo.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT border="0"></A></TD> </TR> </TABLE></BODY></HTML>
