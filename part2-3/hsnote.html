Wolfgang Friebe, <U>Buildings of the World Exhibitions,</U> Leipzig:Edition Leipzig, 1985, includes discussions of the major innovations of the fairs including when and in what ways electricity was exhibited. Friebe gives the 1878 Paris Exhibition as the birthplace of the upsurge in the art of illumination (p. 95) and the 1893 Columbia World's Fair in Chicago as the first time that 'universal applications' for electricity were found (p. 111). <BR><BR><A NAME="15">15.

Holly, <U>Samantha at the World's Fair,</U>NY:Funk and Wagnells, 1893, pp. 560-1.) The Woman's Building presented the Corn/Model Kitchen that featured a gas stove. (See J.M. Weimann, <U>The Fair Women,</U> Chicago:Academy Chicago, 1981, pp. 459-63; illustration p. 461.) To demonstrate her scientific principles of food preparation, Ellen Swallow Richards set up the Rumsford Kitchen near the Liberal Arts Building. (Weimann, p. 462.)<BR><BR><A NAME="16">16.
