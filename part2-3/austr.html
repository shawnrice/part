The absence of customs clearancegives one a false sense of security, as if the policy of neutrality, adoptedby Austria in 1955, is a comfortable womb that warmly ensconces all inhabitantsof the city -temporary or otherwise. Precisely this instability leads theskeptical visitor to question the motives of this city in continuing todefine itself as the epitome of European gentility while remaining conspicuouslyabsent from all international accounts of politics and culture. Ever sincethe recuperation of an Austrian national identity after the German Anschluss,which effectively subsumed the eminence of fin-de-siecle Vienna under thedogma of National Socialism, a crisis situation has prevailed in whichthe producers of Austrian culture have focused their energies on the piecingtogether of their shattered past, while at the same time continually defendingthemselves against charges of obsolescence from the rest of Europe andbeyond. It has been suggested that the period of German occupation erasedany notion of an Austrian identity, and that at the close of this century,the country is only beginning to recover any sort of indigenous presence.&nbsp;<P>The capital city of Vienna, while retaining its architectural gloryand its revered classical music productions, has entered a prolonged periodof cultural stagnation. Threatening to collapse into full-fledgedauto-critique, without the presence of any comfortable distance or self-assurance,the past twenty or thirty years of Austrian art, architecture, music, andliterature clearly exhibit a shared thread of pessimism and self-doubt.As is often the case, powerful and probing work is often born of adversity,if not of sheer stagnancy, and contemporary Austria is no exception. Painting,literature, and music can always thrive in such an environment, but thethreat to architecture, to the very core of urban existence, transcendsprivate boundaries into the public realm.But the questions remain: Howcan the classical economy of forms be supported within an urban environmentthat no longer believes in its capacity to sustain the myth of its ownvalidity? And what shape shall be given to these "anti-forms," born ofthe effort of trying to recall a long-lost grandeur that had missed theopportunity to evolve with impunity over the past fifty years of its ownexistence? Can an aesthetic be created out of the style of "becoming,"of the not-yet-formed? Or, instead of incipience, perhaps these are formsthat constantly are at battle with themselves, fighting from the insideout? And at what stage will this new aesthetic be momentarily arrestedso as to make itself available to its critics?&nbsp;<P>Two separate answers to that question have been posited by two architecturalconcerns, Hans Hollein, and Coop Himmelblau (Wolf Prix and Helmut Swiczinsky). Both these firms came to maturity in the late 1960's during the initial crisisof self-doubt where architecture was literally dismantled and started afreshas a means of erasing historicism &Ntilde;both Austrian and German. Ratherthan striving towards any sort of utopian impulses as a curative for thedissolution of Austrian nationalism, the works of Coop Himmelblau and Holleinremain almost painfully aware of their dichotomous role as public displaysof private sentiments, invoking the dissolution of the past along withvisions of reconstruction.&nbsp;<P>The use of architecture as a social mobilizer is hardly a new concept,nor is the infusion of buildings with a social agenda; Coop Himmelblauand Hollein, however, approach their solutions to the same problems fromopposite ends of the spectrum of skepticism. Plumbing the poles of, onthe one hand, self-pity, and on the other, stubborn pride in the face ofadversity, these two architectural firms embody a sophisticated model ofAustria's postwar consciousness that seeks to dismantle the ornamentalfacade of historicism by looking critically at the ways in which the historyof a particular medium is addressed by later practitioners.&nbsp;<P>Hollein's work seems to issue from a spirit of redemption, rising fromthe ashes in a decidedly optimistic vision of the power of built formsto convey a sense of pregnant hope. Coop Himmelblau offers an architectureof apology, as if the rendering of the materials- offered as humble apologiesto the memory of lost greatness- is cognizant of its own inadequacies.Dispensing with historicity and materialism as recognizable cultural artifacts,especially in the vulgarized form that renders most postmodern architecturalproduction a merely superficial index of commodity culture, the architecturalprojects of Hollein and Coop Himmelblau enact a variant of Frampton's ``criticalregionalism,'' which calls for a response to intrinsic local traditions andvalues- both physical and supraphysical- dialectically conceived in relationwith the incursion of outside (read: alien) influences <A HREF="holliennotes.html#2"><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></A>. Rather than invokingvernacular materials and building methods, these architects cull theirimagery and value systems from the local psychological landscape, presentinga rhetorical strategy that locates both the native and the alien withinthe same forms. Insofar as any sort of shared consciousness can be saidto exist in contemporary Austria as regards the downsizing of its internationalstature, both Coop Himmelblau and Hans Hollein trade upon this insecurityas a means towards understanding how the situation may have come about,how it is in the process of repairing itself (if at all), as well as theemotional component that might dictate the prognosis for a national rehabilitation.&nbsp;<P>The resulting forms do not so much participate in a trajectory of Viennesearchitecture, but rather in a type of automatism that probes the presumedcollective psyche of the Viennese populace. Wolf Prix, one of the CoopHimmelblau's principals, has spoken of the removal of "circumstantial pressureand complexity" through a deliberate obliviousness to architectural historicallaws, to the need for clients, and to money as a motivating factor in design.<A HREF="holliennotes.html#3"><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></A>By removing these materialist obstacles, Prix and Swiczinsky are able tooperate on the level of pure form.&nbsp;<P>Coop Himmelblau brilliantly uses the language of deconstruction andpostmodernist architecture to comment on these manifestations of the architecturalneo-avant-garde, vilifying the presumed aestheticization of the style andparodying its false motives. The work of Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi,for example, strives towards a willful and theoretical deformation, conjuringup impossibly problematized architectural forms as a means of confusingtraditional narratives of space as they bear upon aspects of the externaland internal promenades architecturales. Architect/theorists such as Eisenmanand Tschumi use their own writings to legitimize their architectural projects-a self-reflexivity that isn't without merit, at least as a jumping-offpoint for radicalizing the trajectory of built forms <A HREF="holliennotes.html#4"><FONT SIZE=2>4</FONT></A>. Coop Himmelblauupsets the elitist nature of these projects with a deliberately apologeticprogram, using the innately tenuous aspects of architecture -- suchas tension, counterbalance, transparency -- to destabilize their works,allowing the sheer force of building materials to impact upon their structuralselves and inducing a struggle from within the actual materials.&nbsp;<P>The "tenuous aspects of architecture" mentioned above are describedas such for the implicit dialectic that governs their function, each elementresting (albeit fitfully) in an interstitial state of flux, consistentlydenying resolution as a prerequisite for use. But the counterweight thatguarantees the efficacy of a cantilever is the mere dialectical partnerof the cantilever itself. Coop Himmelblau transgress the meaning of thecantilever and the counterweight in search of something beyond mere physics,something capable of destroying in order to recover -- as in Georges Bataille'sconception of the informe<A HREF="holliennotes.html#5"><FONT SIZE=2>5</FONT></A> -- an eruption from within that nevertheless proceedsfrom a strict adherence to structural rules: the very nature of the building'sundoing is its willful neglect of that which is required to hold it erect.&nbsp;<P>In his introduction to the catalogue of the Deconstructivist Architectureshow- co-curated with Philip Johnson in 1988 for the Museum of Modern Art-Mark Wigley hints at the processes behind deconstruction, suggesting thatthe new architecture is no longer "the conflict between pure forms," butthat "(the) forms themselves are infiltrated with the characteristic skewedgeometry, and distorted."<A HREF="holliennotes.html#6"><FONT SIZE=2>6</FONT></A> Wigley continues to describe Coop Himmelblau'slaw office reconstruction (Vienna, 1989) as taking shape via "the alienemerging out of the stairs, the walls....,"without fully recognizing theimplications of self-reflexivity he attributes to these disintegratingforms. The agenda of Coop Himmelblau requires this putrefaction, and thecity clamors for the "alien" forces, the uncertainty of instability, anythingto upset the stagnant air of history. Admitting that this antipatheticimpetus must come from within the form that it seeks to disrupt is to adducethat an unnatural reliance on the past can only be undone through a painfulreversal of the very forms that restrain.&nbsp;<P>The strategies against architecture<A HREF="holliennotes.html#7"><FONT SIZE=2>7</FONT></A> have been present from their earliestperformances and projects, and came to fruition in their works of the late1970s and early 1980s. Their Roter Engel Bar (Vienna, 1980&ETH;81)continues the practice of exploring unorthodox relationships between interiorand exterior by incorporating a vaguely ovoid shape of stainless steel(the angel's `wing') that weaves in and out of thesmall ground floor space, at one point veering out six feet from the exteriorwall, reentering the building through a minute hole in the masonry onlyto terminate in two jutting points over the door to the interior courtyardin a manner similar to the Secession building project (discussed below).Essentially an interior design, Coop Himmelblau's `angel' enlarges its protectorate by extending onto the street, at the same timecircumscribing an imaginary space only vaguely related to the interiorof the bar. Like Eisenman's cubic displacements, the Roter Engelis a transformation of a core space, but instead of merely pivoting ona central axis, it literally makes a break for the outside, the scoredmasonry of the older building unable to keep it at bay. The angel'srenegade nature presents a challenge as much to the composure of historicalforms as to the contemporary viewer who is forced to cope with its restlessness.&nbsp;<BR><BR><IMG SRC="innen.jpg" BORDER=0 ><BR>interior of the Rote Engel Bar<BR><BR><P>Aestheticism has often been a means for architects to confuse, or evento veil, the ideological component of their work, a practice that tendsto dismiss what has proven to be an effective argument for the conceptof a coding of space that is politically, sociologically, and/or culturallyoriented. In the latter formulation, we allow space to inhabit a dynamicrole, to claim agency as a discrete and organic entity rather than as arepository for attributes resulting from its various usages. By seekingto annihilate any traditional expectations of beauty in a given building,the architect is forcing the visitor/viewer to acknowledge the envelopeor enclosure as a cordoning off of a particular segment of the world, inorder to be impregnated with specific physical and emotional attributesand functions. When an architecture renounces its materiality, or at leastcalls it into question, it stands at odds with the predominant trait ofthe medium, namely its functionality. Architectural practice that intentionallyproblematizes and/or dismantles its functionalism relies on the materialitself, rather than the design, as a means of support, transferring agencyfrom the architect to the built form. The architecture considered in thepresent study, however, problematizes the very nature of the materialsused, as they are deployed without complete confidence in their structuralefficiency. A means of symbolically challenging the historically securewall or ceiling plane, Hollein and Coop Himmelblau play often with thetrope of the fissure, often literally a crack in the interior or exteriorwall, serving not as a spatial divider but as an aestheticized flaw integratedinto the building's design.&nbsp;<P>The fissure is engaged, perhaps, as a critique of the ephemerality ofthe International Style, wherein the tectonic thrust was directed moretowards maintaining the illusion of the building's weightlessnessthan in reference to the actual means of support. But as is evident froma comparison between the way that the fissure is used in two works, CoopHimmelblau's Reiss Bar in Vienna (1977) and Hollein's RauchstrasseHaus 8 in Berlin (1983-5), the space of divergence as it appears on/inthe surface serves two different purposes, in each case underscoring theleitmotif of the respective architectural practice. The exterior of Hollein'sapartments, constructed as part of the I.B.A. project in Berlin, featuresa pink center section scored into odd, asymmetrical patterns, the resulting`cracks'; thus refusing any orthogonal ordering while remainingsuperficial so as to retain the unity of the supporting wall. Althoughappearing to have been pieced together after having been destroyed, thewall coheres in a way so as to play with the notion of dismantling, toaffirm that the fracturing of the assembled blocks is mere illusion, notreality. By ultimately retaining the stability of the wall, Hollein'sbuilding attaches to an inner logic that maintains the structural integrityof the facade while giving the sense that the building has been haltedfor evaluation at a precise yet incomplete moment of its reconstruction.By refusing to finish the wall in a traditionally prescribed fashion, Holleinhints at the additional steps necessary for a full recuperation of a unitedBerlin, the project having been completed while the infamous wall was stillstanding.&nbsp;<BR><BR><IMG SRC="grund.jpg" BORDER=0 >plan of Rote Engel Bar<BR><BR><P>The name of Coop Himmelblau's Reiss Bar plays on the German verbmeaning to tear or split<A HREF="holliennotes.html#8"><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></A>, taking as its foundational principle a quotefrom National Geographic Magazine that refers literally to California,and metaphorically to Vienna: "The most fascinating thing aboutSan Francisco is being in a city that is built on a crack in the earth'scrust and never having that feeling."<A HREF="holliennotes.html#9"><FONT SIZE=2>9</FONT></A> The ancient ties between literatureand architecture are used not as a source of strength or beauty (as inthe qualities of an orator's skill being compared to a building'sformal harmony) but of weakness, by literally engaging a crack into theinfrastructure of this small champagne bar in Vienna's first districtas a challenge to the purity of the internal wall. Less an overt commentarythan a decorative motif, the wall riven into two sections seems capturedin the moment of moving apart, rather than in the process of joining. Thepreparatory sketch for the bar shows the motif as a vibrating, painfulrift threatening to engulf the solid space of the bar; shapeless and divisivein the sketch, the stylized look of the final version avoids any unsettlingsense of displacement, while affirming the projects intent in overturningany normative sense of complacency. The bar's interior is thus subtlytransformed into a non-threatening arena for the discussion of transition,decay, and reformation. But whereas Hollein presents rupture at a stateof reparation, Coop Himmelblau arrests the process of unification at apoint midway between completion and collapse; sheer tectonic force hastriumphed over the humble will of the architects, as if to admit that thechance for failure is equal to, if not greater than, that for success.&nbsp;</TD><TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Earlier the word rehabilitation was used deliberately in order to invokethe therapeutic nature of these architectural practices. Both architecturalfirms adopt the stance of the physician, which may be the most appropriatemetaphor for their chosen roles, the difference lying in the separate practicesthat each accepts. Coop Himmelblau might be likened to an army field doctor,patching together wounded soldiers with perfunctory and temporary solutions.Hollein would be the urbane plastic surgeon, recasting the whole of a damagedsite into a new and synthetically improved state. In this case, Holleinmust grapple with the inherent inadequacies of going against the naturalorder of things, offering solutions for the reconfiguration of sites andbuildings that are ill-conceived, or that have grown old.&nbsp;<P>To the extent that Coop Himmelblau attempts to create an architectureof decay, Hollein may be said to explore the process of rebirth. His majorworks are buildings and projects that seem caught in a process of becoming-- only partially formed but redolent with the suspicion that completionis imminent. Hans Hollein's New Haas Haus builds upon the site oftwo previous incarnations of the Haas Haus, and reconfigures the idea ofthe public building into a pastiche of hopeful symbolism. Hollein, unlikePrix and Swiczinsky, reserves his ties to the past for guidance and strength,understanding the recuperation of glory to be intrinsically tied to transformationof the past. Hollein's first retrospective, held at the PompidouCenter in 1987 was called M&eacute;taphores et M&eacute;tamorphoses. The title is significantin pointing to the architect's reliance on the past, specificallyin the sense that both metaphors and metamorphoses require an antecedentaround which the particular action or allusion is to occur. In an interviewappearing in the catalogue, Hollein states: "Life without historywould be unthinkable and, for me, architecture without history would beno less unthinkable."<A HREF="holliennotes.html#10"><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></A>Hollein completely rethinks the site of theHaas Haus, which lies at the most crucial and public intersection of Vienna'spedestrian zone, diagonally across from the Cathedral of St. Stephan. Holleinallows the monumentality of the site to accept the lion's shareof attention, and the actual structure of the Haas Haus is quite modestin size. Its success is based on the southwestern facade that faces awayfrom the cathedral; here Hollein captures the spirit of redemption in amassive, sheer wall of glass and steel that gradually emerges from withina scored metal shell. Peter Eisenman writes in praise of the building:&nbsp;<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"[The Haas Haus] become[s] a figural building in itself, bothin its form and its material content. Second, the new Haas house representsanother kind of contextualism in a true postmodern sense. Because it workstwo themes simultaneously; it creates a `tabula rasa' by removingthe existing building. This in itself is an extraordinary political gesture,but then it rebuilds the context in a rather non-contextual manner. Itcreates a deeply eroded and fractured building, which in its metal andglass exterior foreshadows the complex unfolding of its interior contents."<A HREF="holliennotes.html#11"><FONT SIZE=2>11</FONT></A>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Hollein's project is not so much an erasure of the former building,but a recuperation of its function as multi-use public space addressedthrough a more contemporary stylization. The facade mentioned above, aswell as in Eisenman's statement, alludes to the way in which thenew building can be seen to emerge from the ashes of the old, still withinsight of salvation.&nbsp;<P>No longer are the site and its intended building meant as a tabula rasafor the present or future generation, nor do they stand as a heroic triumphover past woes; even the most public building built by either of thesearchitects, Hollein's New Haas Haus (Vienna, 1992), resolutely avoidsany sense of monumentality in favor of a relatively tentative step in theprocess of recovery. It might be easier to understand these projects asanthropomorphized to the point of physical vulnerability (a trait normallyantithetical to architecture; hence, deeply ironic), fundamentally rejectingany and all of the monolithic and totalizing modernist myths, concentratinginstead on the particular rather than the general, finding solutions (orpropositions thereof) in the cracks and interstices of contemporary Vienneseconsciousness. The aesthetic impulse thus plays a supporting role to thefunctional role of the building; however, functional, in this case, meanssomething different than the early twentieth-century definition of theterm. Now, at the close of the millennium, functionalism has moved beyondits ties to the machine to incorporate the mobilizations of any generativeimpulse, including the cultural. <A HREF="holliennotes.html#12"><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></A><BR><BR>Coop Himmelblau proposes a type of anthropomorphismpredicated on lack rather than substance. Whereas the tradition of architecturefrom the Greeks onwards can be said to have based systems of measurementon the scale of human proportions, Coop Himmelblau uses a radically divergentmeasure of man: that of his deficiencies. Because the range of human faultsis far greater even than the scope of differing physiques, Coop Himmelblau'sarchitecture must resist any codified or normative style, attempting, instead,to allow the idiosyncrasies of each potential inhabitant to recover themselvesin relation to the experience of the building. Perhaps the best exampleis the Open House of 1983. The initial sketch for this work, conceivedthrough a long period of contemplation on the concept, followed by severalseconds of frenzied activity with pencil and paper, appears as the workof an invalid or a schizophrenic: orthogonals refuse to meet one another,spidery tendrils creep off to the side without purpose, the whole worksituated in an impossible space, stabilized only by the hesitant inclusionof a ground line. Coop Himmelblau writes: "The distribution of the100 m2 area is not predefined. It may be determined after the buildingis completed or not at all."<A HREF="holliennotes.html#13"><FONT SIZE=2>13</FONT></A> Radically different from the Corbusier'splan libre, which frees the interior space but subjects it to a stiflingpredisposition towards orthogonal configuration, the Open House is exactlyneutral in its projections of the deployment of spatial configurations,allowing for the space to conform itself, once again in a self-reflexivemechanism that always harbors an equal chance of success or failure. Prixconfirms the instability of the house's psychic and physical identity,at the same time reinforcing the architect's position as nurturerof the terminally ill: "The house is very complicated and is thereforelike the disabled child which we love very much."&nbsp;<A HREF="holliennotes.html#14"><FONT SIZE=2>14</FONT></A><P>Coop Himmelblau's most celebrated work, completed in 1989, ispreviously mentioned rooftop law offices in Vienna. The structure, situatedfive minutes from both Wagner's Postsparkasse and Hollein'sHaas Haus in the most architecturally fertile part of Vienna's firstdistrict, hangs precariously from its perch atop a nondescript nineteenth-centurybuilding like a bird caught in an electrical wire. A slightly more robustversion of the Open House (discussed below), the law office, which wasfeatured in the Deconstructivist Architecture show, resists any readingof itself as a pleasing entity, literally challenging the viewer to findenjoyment in its appearance. Making no effort to harmonize with the buildingon which it balances, the entire structure seems to sway with the breeze,threatening at any instant to topple onto the street below. The only safeguardagainst disaster appears to be a taut bow-shaped truss, groaning underthe strain of its load, but fortunately buttressed from below by a secondary(and hidden) steel and concrete foundation that offsets the lateral load,thus relieving the weight on the non-load-bearing walls of the older structure.&nbsp;<P>Hollein and Coop Himmelblau's ties to the past are no more poignantlyexpressed than in two projects directly related to the historical eminenceof Vienna. Although admittedly ten years apart, these projects highlightthe specific differences between an aesthetic of redemption (Hollein) andof decay (Coop Himmelblau). Hollein's new facade for the KuenstlerhausVienna (1989) -- created for the exhibition held in the same year entitledTraum und Wirklichkeit (Dream and Reality) -- adds to a group of similartransformations to which he has subjected the same building. He recaststhe neoclassical facade in a postmodern pastiche of familiar expressionistsymbols, using a female figure from a controversial Klimt mural set offagainst a segment from Karl Ehn's Karl-Marx Hof (Vienna, 1927) -- thetwo together embodying the antipodal realms of the exhibition'stitle. Hollein understands completely the ironic cultural shift that allowsfor these two works to be used as symbols of the city's gloriouspast, given that neither the Klimt nor the Ehn housing estate presumablyreflects Austria's most cherished contributions to twentieth-centuryculture:<A HREF="holliennotes.html#15"><FONT SIZE=2>15</FONT></A> the Klimt mural was, as was often the case, a scandal, while theKarl Marx Hof recalls an impoverished period in Vienna's recenthistory wherein subsidized housing appeared as a means of salvation. TheKlimt figure reappears around the same time in the interior of the NewHaas Haus, with arms raised in victory, hardly unaware of the candor withwhich she stands amid this new and controversial architectural form.&nbsp;<P>Coop Himmelblau forsakes such subtle irony for bluntness in their projectedtransformation of Olbrich's venerable Secession building for the1979 Viennese Biennale. Neither exclusively an interior nor an exteriorrenovation, Coop Himmelblau's project, titled Vector, calls fora 54-meter long aluminum needle to enter the building from the rear andto emerge, point first, at the top of the main entrance, creating a macabreand foreboding canopy. Strangely, the project avoids any sentiments ofviolence by the grace and cleanliness with which the body of the extantstructure is punctured as if by a surgical lance. The point clearly isto recontextualize the relationship of the interior to the exterior, bycreating an extension that confuses the boundaries of the two in relationto this new formal element; as result, the viewer is destabilized in relationto the whole.&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>visit<BR><A HREF="http://privat.schlund.de/joe-kollegger/e_build-2.htm">HERE<BR></A>for more</TD></TR><TR><TD>In the final analysis, the work of Coop Himmelblau and Hans Holleinmay be considered as participating in an emotionally-wrought discursivepractice that seeks to demystify one's demons in order to controlthem. Hollein and Coop Himmelblau regularly abandon the traditional waysin which architecture's ability to bespeak its innate purpose isarticulated, irrepressibly insisting against the readymade tendencies ofmuch institutional architecture -- as well as against modernist architecturaldiscourses such as the fading International Style and Postmodernism. Indoing so they create both the playing field and the characters for thedrama that they wish to watch unfold.&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="p3cont.html#REVIEWS"><IMG SRC="content.jpg" BORDER=0  ALIGN=RIGHT></A></TD></TR></TABLE>&nbsp;</BODY></HTML>
