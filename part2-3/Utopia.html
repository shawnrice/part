This is a pressing question when the established biennales likethe Venice Biennale and the Documenta are reaching their seniorities while a multitude ofyounger large-scale biennales are springing up in Berlin, Luxemburg, Johannesburg,Seoul, and other places. After visiting the three mega-art events this summer, Iexperienced a bit of post-party distress, interspersed with thoughts on unresolved issuesabout these blockbuster exhibitions -- the politics of representation, the festivalization ofart, the partnerships of culture and industry, and the globalization of everyday life --scenarios calling for suspicion, not celebration. What do these international art eventshave to offer other than contributing to an expanding culture industry? And to what extentdo they foster meaningful cross-cultural dialogue and critique? Andreas Huyssen’scomment on monumentality is insightful. Huyssen suggested that despite the commonassumption that we live in a global, transnational culture, there are still culturalboundaries, socio-economic disparities, language barriers, modes of domination andcontrol all over the globe, as well as in cyberspace.<HR><P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">THE 47TH VENICE BIENNALE <BR></FONT COLOR>     The Venice Biennale celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1995. Despite this year’sartistic director, German Celant’s attempt to reinvent this obsolete 19th-century model ofart exhibition based on national competition, the 47th Venice Biennale of 1997 is stilldeeply entrenched in the structure of an “Art Olympics,” still guided or misguided byinternational power politics and economic interests. Celant’s curatorial efforts are onlyrealized in two sites: the Italian Pavilion on the main site of Giardini where the nationalpavilions assert their territories, and the Corderie in the Arsenale, a prominent navalcomplex close to the main site.<P>     For both sites, Celant uses an “open system” which is designed to extend beyondnational boundaries by incorporating artists from different countries and differentgenerations, to whom Celant refers as “transnational nomads.” Representing artists ofdiverse nationalities and generations under one roof may be unusual for the VeniceBiennale, but it is hardly an innovative curatorial strategy. The so-called openness fallsshort of being adventurous and experimental but simply reveals a rather unfocused andpredictable curatorial position. In comparison, the Nordic pavilion achieved outstandingresults by including artists from outside the Nordic region for its exhibition “NaturallyArtificial.” The contributions by Mark Dion, Henrik Hakansson, Mariko Mori, SvenPahlsson and Marianna Uutinen conveyed a sense of diverse and yet shared sensibilitiesabout the paradoxical relationships between nature and culture, and about theinterpenetration of the natural and the artificial. <P>     We had been told that Celant had only four months to organize this Biennale,which makes the lack of curatorial direction more understandable. But the real issue atstake was the political battles and personal interests of the city government, the state, andthe businesses who could not agree until the last minute whether to claim a piece of theblockbuster pie this year or wait for the millenium bash. Political-economic interestsoverrode aesthetic considerations. The Biennale is basically an instrument for achievingthe various mundane objectives of the multiple players involved, giving low priority toconsiderations of exhibition quality and integrity. These hidden agendas are probablyprevalent among other large-scale exhibitions, which have considerable leverage to drawpublic and private supporters/sponsors because of their ability to attract international andhuge audiences, tourist dollars and high profile media coverage.<P>     Operating under the loose framework of “Future Present Past,” Celant conceivedthe two shows based on three periods of artistic movements: from the '60s to the '70s asdefined by Pop, Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Arte Povera, as represented by ClaeOldenburg with Coosje van Bruggen, Sol LeWitt, Mario Merz, John Baldessari, JanDibbets and others; the '80s era of Neoexpressionist paintings and Post-Pop asrepresented by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer and Robert Longo, among others; andthe '90s concerns with globalism and multiculturalism as in the work of Cai Guo Qiangand Ilya and Emilia Kabakov. The established figures had been invited to contribute arecent work to be shown alongside the work of younger artists. However, it is difficult toget a coherent sense of connections or specific relationships from most of his placementsas one wanders through those sprawling rooms in the Italian Pavilion, showing the workof Ed Ruscha, Annette Messager, Rebecca Horn, Richard Tuttle, Jim Dine, LucianoFabro, Brice Marden, Gino De Dominicis, and others. The elongated exhibition space inthe Corderie is left open without any dividing walls. One encounters a very theatricalbeginning with Jeff Koon’s sculpture and a monumental ending with Julian Schnabel’spainting. Many of the works in-between delivered spectacular presentation, as in RobertLongo’s sculpture and Mariko Mori’s color photo-mural. While the exhibition isphysically open, it is not necessarily conceptually adventurous as one is constantly beingreminded of the “masters” and their legacies in younger generations, whose works areoften dimmed or decontextualized in the juxtapositions.<P>     The manner in which different nations are represented appears to be highlypolitical and problematic. The Giardini site, which houses the national pavilions, waspromoted as the core of the Biennale, furnishing a map clearly indicating the location ofeach national pavilion. Primarily occupied by European and North American countries, themain site includes only two Asian countries (Japan and Korea), and three South Americancountries (Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela). The pavilions of other countries such asArmenia, Croatia and Argentina are located off the main site, utilizing the spaces of localchurches, palaces and museums scattered throughout the city of Venice. No maps areprovided to guide the visitor in locating the less prominently represented countries.Wandering around the meandering streets and quaint piazzas of Venice can be a veryenjoyable and even educational experience, but this does not relieve the frustrations ofbeing lost, of being systematically discouraged from seeing the works of under-represented regions.<P>     The lesson learned from the Venice experience is that site and placement do matter-- even in our time of supposedly globalized, decentralized, and virtual spaces --unfortunately, every site is not equal. Selection and exclusion always accompanydecision-making, whether it concerns physical space or cyberspace. And often, unevenarrangements or token representations are still based on the political and economic statusof nation-states. After all, the “transnational nomads” still have to wander withinpredetermined structures and institutional contraints. The idea that we can alter thisobsolete paradigm founded on the hierarchy of nation-states by simply rearranging the artbeing shown rather than challenging the underlying political and economic forces at workis naive and deceptive. Art, after all, is not separate from politics.<P><HR><P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">Documenta X </FONT COLOR>  <P><IMG SRC="documenta.jpg"><P>     Politics is a buzzword in this year’s Documenta. What does Documenta X have tooffer, in the light of its artistic director Catherine David’s emphatic claims toorchestrate this year’s project with a critical and political purpose? As she iterated in theDocumenta Short Guide, “it may seem paradoxical or deliberately outrageous to envisiona critical confrontation with the present in the framework of an institution that over thepast twenty years has become a Mecca for tourism and cultural consumption. Yet thepressing issues of today make it equally presumptuous to abandon all ethical and politicaldemands.”<P>     The Documenta X exhibition is accompanied by two other components: the “100Days -- 100 Guests” lecture program which is also distributed through the Internet; andthe Book, an 840-page collection of text and image, criticism and essays by artists, critics,art historians, philosophers, social theorists, and writers from various disciplines. Inaddition, a variety of theatre and film projects were commissioned specifically forDocumenta X. Armed with a generous budget of over US$12 million and given a periodof four years to organize the project, David mobilized an exhaustive list of cross-disciplinary participants and events to materialize a large-scale, multi-media event ofcontemporary culture.<P>     Despite the diversity of medium and artistic production, David manages to asserther voice and her control throughout the project, which is particularly pronounced in theexhibition. This turns out to be both a strength and a weakness of the project. With a verywell-articulated theoretical proposition and a narrowly focused curatorial position, Davidsteers the viewer along the “parcours”, or path, from the old train station to the last stop,the Orangerie, seemingly with a single purpose in mind -- to assert her idea of whatcritical art and political art should be. In an interview with Robert Storr, Daviddifferentiates between rhetorical, instrumentalized political art and the critical art that shepriviledges. “Critical art has a wider compass: it has to do with what I would call theradical critique of culture’s anthropological foundations -- meaning, paying attention toarticulations, to sites of relevance, and to shifts from one area of competence to another.”In the exhibition, the work of Marcel Broodthaers, Gordon Matta-Clark, Jeff Wall, andStan Douglas are exemplaries in their radical critiques of the categories of perception andknowledge functioning within art, language, and culture. Broodthaers articulated theconceptual and institutional framing of the fine arts; Matta-Clark subverted theideological and operational principles of architectural practice; Wall redefines theboundaries of the fine arts and the media arts; and Douglas analyses the language of themedia arts and technology. <P>     It is promising to see curators taking a position, making known the underlyingpurpose, and working through one’s presuppositions and criteria of selection. Most large-scale contemporary art exhibitions tend to present a survey of current artistic production,sampling works from a wide spectrum of practices, seemingly without a bias orpreference other than affirming the current artistic trends. By now, we realize that it ispresumptuous, if not naive, for curators to claim objectivity and universal representation.Social and cultural production is inevitably framed by our own subjectivities and personalagendas. However, David’s singular definition of critical art overlooks the heterogeneousstrategies and the unresolved conditions of art production, thereby limiting thepossibilities for critical practices. There are only a handful of works in the exhibitionwhich have a more direct confrontation with social and political issues, as in the work ofHans Haacke, Nancy Spero, and Johan Grimonprez. David probably did not select theseworks for their explicit political content. I agree that it is crucial to acknowledge thesignificance of critical interventions which question the underlying conditions ofperception and knowledge. However, by excluding the more confrontationalinterventions, David commits the same flaw that she attempts to challenge, namely, thecomplacency of accepting dominant categories, and in this case, her own hierarchizationof critical art. One alternative is using multiple subjectivities on the curatorial level,allowing room for other voices in exploring the possibilities for critical art production.<P>     One of the inspiring features of Documenta X is the prominence given to“historical works” (from the '40s to '70s) and the reconstructed context within which someof these well-known works are re-presented. The blending of historical and recent worksis encouraging, especially when the juxtapositions reconstruct meanings and redefinerelationships among established categories of work. For instance, one of the centralthreads linking the works of Documenta X is urbanism and architecture. Walker Evans’black and white documentary photographs of New York subway passengers are placedamong the urban interventionist work of Matta-Clark, Haacke, and Alison and PeterSmithson. Correspondingly, the series of small-scale photographs of urban streets takenby Helen Levitt in the '40s are so prominently displayed that they encourage the viewer toreassess the critical potential of these works. These juxtapositions help to bring out theinterventionist aspect of these historical works and underscore how they deviated fromthe humanist tradition of documentary photography in the '30s and '40s. The curatorialstrategy of blending historical and contemporary works is promising, as it stands apartfrom previous Documentas as well as many large-scale contemporary art exhibitionswhich primarily presented a survey of recent works.<P>     However, David’s selection of recent works on urbanism and architecture is not asstrong in comparison to the historical ones. Rem Koolhaas' superimposition of image andtext of the Pearl River Delta development takes up 36 pages in the Book and itsinstallation as “wall paper" occupies vast wall spaces of two galleries. The computer-generated photo-montage, the “sound-byte” text, and its floor-to-ceiling, colorful densesurface may serve to suggest the intensity and extensiveness of urban and technologicaldevelopments in China, but barely engage the viewer on more critical issues such as thesocial and cultural impact of rapid modernization and industrialization, and theexperience of language and cultural barriers. Yana Milev’s elaborate equipment employedto delineate the boundaries of public and private space seems simplistic and rigid, failingto address the socio-psychological and institutional conditions of territoriality. Afterseeing a few more of these uninspiring contemporary works, one tends to gather thedismal impression that the golden era of critical, urban interventionist art belong to the'60s and 70's generation of conceptual art practices.<P>     After having spent several days in Kassel, I still could not get a sense of thehistory, social and urban processes that are specific to Kassel. Or may be there are none?That appears to be the impression that Documenta X renders the city, which comes acrossas just another generic, postindustrial European city going through the boom and bustcycles at the mercy of the global economy. This is a rather grand assumption,presupposing that global forces mask everyday life, local histories and specific socio-economic and political processes. Kassel simply functions as a backdrop for DocumentaX, with the exception of a few works. Dan Graham’s “Video for Two Showcase Windows,”installed on the Treppenstrasse pedestrian shopping mall, reverberates with the window-shopping activities and the spectator/consumer’s experience of desiring the displayedcommodities. Stephen Craig’s almost life-size model pavilion with interior video, whichalso refers to the Treppenstrasse, recalls the historical source and the residents’ personalexperiences of the mall’s modern functionalist architecture. Aglaia Konrad’s photo-glassinstallation reminds the viewer of the rift between the inside and outside, between theaestheticized images of cities and the immediate perceptual and spatial experience ofKassel. Another historically and spatially specific work is Christian Phillip Muller’sinstallation in the Museum Fridericianum. It makes direct references to Joseph Beuy’s“7,000 Oaks” and Walter de Maria’s “Vertical Earth,” both installed in the Friedrichsplatz infront of the Museum. Using photo text, and the specific site, Muller providesinformation about past Documentas and demonstrates how these two canonical workshave been “altered” or put off-balance due to the development of a parking garageunderneath the plaza.<P>     Despite David’s tight conceptual and spatial framework in delineating theDocumenta X boundary, one could get a sense of the larger institutional and discursiveframeworks within which Documenta X operates. Local businesses are eager to exploitthis crowd-attraction event; city resources are expended to facilitate this internationalcontemporary art showpiece for the city. The “partnerships” of art and industry areapparent everywhere as one gets a drink at Bistro Dokumentation, selects from theDocumenta Menu listing appetizing dining selections supplemented with bits and piecesof Documenta’s history, or stares at the shoe shop window presenting the red and blackshoes to match the Documenta X logo on display. I am still wondering to what extent hasDocumenta X engaged visitors in a critical gaze on its own framing and history.<P><HR><P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">SCULPTURE PROJECT IN MUNSTER 1997</FONT COLOR><BR>     The Sculpture Project in Munster of 1997 comes across as a “work in progress,”demonstrating the experimental process that artists go through in realizing their art. TheSculpture Project of '87 focused on the exploration of site-specific works, interrogatingthe interrelationships of sculpture, public space, and context. For the '97 project, “art-as-services” appears to be the dominant trend, as suggested by Walter Grasskemp in theexhibition catalogue. Many artists provided functional objects and provided services forrecreational purposes. Examples include Jorge Pardo’s pier/pavilion, Marie-AngeGuilleminot's message facility, Bert Theis’ recreational platform, Andrea Zittel’s exoticminiature islands, and Zobernig’s advertising billboards. A large number of these worksappear light-hearted, playful and to some extent, rather facile. Have we exhausted thepossibilities of producing critical sculptures in public spaces?<P>     Defining public space has become extremely problematic as our social life isincreasingly infiltrated by the private industry, the media, and cyberspace. Inconsideration of the current crisis of public space, I think the significant works of theSculpture Project '97 are those which are reflexive of its own language structures andlimitations, and are critical of the institutional and discursive frameworks within whichpublic sculpture is realized. These are works which articulate and problematize theaesthetic, social and communication limitations of art in the public sphere.<P>     Unfortunately, only a small number of the works in the '97 project adequatelyaddress these concerns. Exemplary ones are Hans Haacke’s Standorf “Merry-go-round” andJanet Cardiff’s “Walk Munster and Telescope/Video.” Constructed as a “double” of theadjacent 1909 war memorial, Haacke’s carousel is concealed by an imposing cylindricalwooden structure. Through the wooden slits, one can detect sparks of glimmering lightand faint tunes of the German national anthem, giving clues to the hidden, rotating, andempty merry-go-round. This provocative, multi-faceted installation refuses easy access,resisting the facile consumption of leisure. It brings up the double functions ofmonuments as national symbols of power and as objects of leisure, suggesting thelimitations of public sculpture in fostering open dialogue. Janet Cardiff’s audio tour mixesMunster’s environmental noises with fabricated sounds, and blends fictional narrative withactual events and sites; all of which reflects the multiple sources and languages thatinform our construction of histories and memories of a place. The visual componentinvolves the installation of a telescope which had been reconstructed with a “video lens”,projecting a fictional view of the environment outside the museum. The work articulatesthe tension, and the discrepancy between representation and reality, between the framing andthe framed. The visual device is located inside a museum and the audio tour is similar tothe didactic audio tours that visitors use in museums. Both works remind us of how ourperception and reception are constructed within the site, structure, and language ofinstitutions.<P>      The majority of works in this year’s project refers to leisure and the amusementpark. While many of them are surprisingly simplistic, there are some which offer a moreambiguous, ironic reading of leisure. Examples are Tobias Rehberger’s fictitious bar, KimAdam’s inaccessible carousel that does not turn, and Elin Wikstrom/Anna Brag’sreconstructed bicyles that travel backwards.  <P><HR></TD> <TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD>    After going through the “rummage sale” show in Venice, and the didactic andcerebral project in Kassel, the art-hunt in Munster seemed initially so refreshing and digestible. But on second thought, I realized the catch. Munster is a very charming, idyllic,and small city, a fertile ground for the leisure industry and resort development. If thesculpture project as a whole manages to encourage visitors to participate in rather thanquestion the conditions of leisure, what is the critical potential of sculpture in publicplaces at the end of the 20th-century?  Is there still room for resisting the festivalizationof art and challenging the ideological, structural, and operational principles of the leisureindustry? Has site-specificity really had its time? This seems to be the case as far as howthese exhibitions related to their cities. The Venice Biennale placed minimal significanceon the numerous sites of exhibitions scattered throughout the city. Documenta X surveyedmany cities across the globe to analyse the effects of globalization without paying enoughattention to the specific situations in Kassel. And the Munster Sculpture Project '97, whilebeing in tune with what the specific sites have to offer, had neither repositioneditself to interrogate the specific conditions of leisure in Munster, nor furthered theachievements of the '87 project. </TD> <TD><A HREF="p2contents.html"><IMG SRC="contentlogo.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT border="0"></A></TD> </TR> </TABLE></FONT></BODY></HTML>
