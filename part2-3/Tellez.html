Whereas at onetime exhibitions like The Art of the Fantastic were critiqued fortheir curatorial one-dimensionality that decontextualized LatinAmerican art of its social, political, and historical specificity,the pendulum has swung the other way in producing curatorialdiscourse that diminishes heterogeneity in excluding artisticpractice that is not focused mainly on European and North Americantrends. A healthy, vibrant, and much needed resistance to thisdiscourse can be seen in the work of Javier Tellez. This work is aconfluence of divergent aesthetic influences that addresses social,political, and personal concerns, and through its poetic and attime visceral beauty, it becomes tantamount to a hand grenadewrapped in velvet.<P>     Tellez’s recent installation entitled “Penalty” exhibited lastspring at the Silverstein Gallery in New York, incorporated adiversity of media that addressed a multiplicity of issues. Uponentering the installation one was immediately drawn into the workthrough the counterpoint of formal elements: hung on the four wallsof the gallery were photographs and a soccer referee’s shirt witha Rolling Stones logo and placed underneath it was a pair ofreferee flags. Juxtaposed with this encompassing planar schema ofphotographs, shirt and flags was the three-dimensionality of thecentral installation consisting of two regulation soccer posts withsocks that hung from their nets, and between the posts was a small mattress covered with a “sheet” that was stitched to simulate asoccer field. Placed on top and in the center of the “soccer field”was a cactus in a planter.<P>     The photographs, which are a formal tour de force inthemselves, were at times pastoral but more often depicted  thebrutal conditions of the infamous Tocuyito Prison in Venezuela.Printed across the photographs were texts appropriated fromofficial sources dissimilar in typography. This appropriationimmediately set up a tension that was formal as well as contextual.Foregrounding the ideological nature of sign systems, the differenttypographies of the photographs were juxtaposed so that they seemedto emanate from socially varied locations. Semiotically, script canconvey ideology since its history and utilization are associatedwith particular classes or sociocultural practices. Taking thesesubtle dynamics into consideration, Tellez appropriated an officialVenezuelan tourist slogan and placed it on the sides of thephotographs. The slogan printed in bold color announced: “VENEZUELAThe best kept secret in the Caribbean.” Opposite this text wasanother in “journalistic” or “neutral” typography that stated: “ThePenitentiary of Tocuyito, Carabobo state.”<P>     Typographical interplay was compounded by the disjunctionbetween text and image. The photographs were postcards via theirslogans, and through their more “neutral” typography were alsoarchival documents of surveillance that recorded activities withinthe prison. Phenemenological slippage between the description andclassification of the photographs as “objective” documents and“fictional” narratives allowed them to oscillate freely betweenwhat Roland Barthes calls the studium and punctum.<P>     The studium, according to Barthes, gives “photographs anaverage affect” and while it allows one to enter into the pictorialfield “culturally” and “participate in the figures, the faces, thegestures, the settings, the actions...the studium is [also] thatvery wide field of unconcerned desire, of various interest, ofinconsequential taste.” In contrast to the studium is thepunctum, which intervenes, ruptures, breaks, and punctures the image. The  punctum is not directly perceived in the tableau but “rises from the scene, shoots out like an arrow and pierces [theviewer].”<P>     The photographs in Tellez’s installation encapsulated thestudium and punctum to a heightened degree and hinted at thepolysemy in the work’s narrative. One image showed the exterior ofthe prison which at first glance became an aestheticized landscapein somber tones of grays and blues of almost “inconsequentialtaste.” The studium was opaque as the image conveyed a sense of theepic and panoramic through the minimalist horizontality of griddedbuildings that were visually counterpointed by the verticality ofthe guard's tower. What disrupted the idyllic tableau vis-a-vis thepunctum was the realization of the tower as a symbol of repressionand surveillance. Surveillance and the institutional power behindit were addressed in another photograph by implicating the viewerthrough the complicity of the gaze. <P>     In a faux portrait setting within the photograph, prisoners insoccer garb and huddled together as a team stared back at theviewer as mediators between the gaze of the viewer and that of the surveillance tower. Tellez troped the relationship between subjectand object via the typography by jarring the viewer’s conscienceand social acquiescence through an either/or dichotomy. Through theveneer of the postcard, the huddled individuals were viewed aspersons with a nonthreatening and almost inviting demeanor. Throughthe typography that designates them as prisoners, the viewer’ssocialization reflexively marginalized them as pariahs creating aninternal conflict via a Dostoevskian conundrum and punctum parexcellence: the prisoner's obvious humanity stealthily resonatedwith that of the viewer’s and subsequently interrogated thelatter’s notion of morality, crime and punishment. It was as if foronce the jurors became executioners and consequently their actions,integrity and conscience were called into question.<P>     Another critique of judicial process, however this time withina north/south context, was addressed in a poignant yet seeminglyparodic manner through the referee’s shirt with a Rolling Stoneslogo. Like the corpus of Tellez’s work, the critique was freightedwith multiple interpetations for it questioned the cultural as wellas judicial since cultural identity was referenced vis-a-vis thesymbol of a British rock band. By using the logo, Tellez invertedthe Brazilian writer Oswald de Andrade’s concept of anthropophagy.<P>     In the  Anthropophagy Manifesto of 1928, Andrade rallies for“The daily love and the capitalist modus vivendi. Anthropophagy.Absorption of the sacred enemy...in order to transform the taboointo totem.” Andrade’s anthropophagy or “cannibalization”attempted to reconcile European influences with his own culturalmilieu in order to forge an authentic modern Brazilian voice thatwould not only retain its uniqueness, but in its syncreticModernity, engage itself in and contribute to the burgeoningModernist international.<P>     In the installation, the consumption of Western culture andits hybridization was less potentially liberatory. Instead it was associated more with the normative in its perpetuation of thestatus quo symbolized in the referee’s shirt and logo and itsalignment with institutional power. In  referencing this power, itsdiscourse and circuits, and in addressing the subsumation of oneculture by another, the referee’s shirt became a sort of palimpsestof north/south and institutional/prisoner dynamics. For the refereeis not only the mediator of “order” in the soccer game that isplayed by the prisoners for “rehabilitation” purposes. But throughthe logo it is also an embodiment of external cultural encroachmentand of subtle institutional power that is interchangeable with theinstallation’s other images of authority and repression: theguard's tower, barbed wire fencing, rooms for solitary confinement,a hole in the floor evincing a failed escape...that alluded to avoid or abyss of hopelessness. Yet, for Tellez to convey fully thedesolation, alienation, and fragmentation that is the experientiallowest common denominator in the incarceration labyrinth, he evokedthe prisoner’s presence through their absence.<P>       Absent presence unified and cohered the surroundingphotographs and objects with the central part of the installation:the soccer posts  and mattress. Although Tellez reiterated thenorth/south binary, he collapsed it by paralleling the sociallymarginal within North America and Venezuela through the urbanvernacular.<P>     In low income minority urban centers in the U.S. victims ofviolence are memorialized by having their sneakers hung by theirshoe strings in trees, on fences around basketball courts, and overtelephone lines. Tellez poetically referenced this urban phenomenonin the installation while allowing it to resonate with multiplemeanings. The suspended socks became the symbolic counterpart tothe sneakers and not only were they indices of social milieux thatgenerate such vernacular practices, but they reverted back to thenarrative of the prisoners as soccer players who, in transgressingthe rules of the game (and society), are in a perpetual state ofPenalty. Social and psychological displacement was furtherreferenced by the mattress with a sheet that served as the “soccerfield” in which the game--or desire--is played out under thevigilance of guards, wardens, the incarceration apparatus, and thelarger Venezuelan sociopolitical machinery.<P></TD> <TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD>     A final example of Tellez’s subversive imagination was thecoup de grace of the installation's center with its perverseBorgesian and panopticon allusions. Like the bargaining table where prison administrators and reformers can convene in dialogue, theonly “neutral” space on the “soccer field” where opposing teams canmeet on equal footing, even for a moment, was intervened by acactus. </TD> <TD><A HREF="p2contents.html"><IMG SRC="contentlogo.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT border="0"></A></TD> </TR> </TABLE></FONT></BODY></HTML>
