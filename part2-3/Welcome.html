Becausethere aren't enough of them. There are many voices to beheard in the areas we explore, and as the name PARTsuggests, we aspire modestly to add our fragments ofscholarship to an increasingly diverse and far-reachingdiscourse.  Why an electronic journal? So far, becausethat's what we can afford.  And we're trying for thewidest audience possible.<BR>We are also trying to be as inclusive in our content aspossible.  Articles in this issue range from what somewould consider as more traditional art history totheoretical inquiries into modes of vision and Lacaniananalysis.  Our reviews cover film, books, andexhibitions.  Our "Practices" section is devoted toemerging professionals considering issues of pedagogicaland curatorial practices from a more intimate andcollegial point of view.  And we will try to focus ourcalendar on events of particular interest to students ofart and its histories, including calls for papers andnotices of various conferences and symposia.<P>PART is produced and edited by students in the ArtHistory Program of the Graduate Center of the CityUniversity of New York.  This first issue has the "let'sput on a show " feel of any do-it-yourself venture.  Butwe do not want to limit our contributors to thisconstituency.  We welcome the correspondence of ourreaders as we embark on this project.We also welcome submissions from others.  If you wish tosubmit a work that engages some aspect of art or visualculture, send a disc in ASCII format to PART, Art HistoryDepartment, Graduate School and University Center, CityUniversity of New York, 33 West 42nd St, New York, NY,10033.  Address your piece to the appropriate editor:either Features, Reviews, or Calendar.  Articles shouldnot exceed 2,000 words (please include an abstract);reviews should not exceed 500 words.  Include a papercopy of your text along with the disc.  All submissionswill be read and formal responses will be rendered. Inthe event of acceptance, authors are responsible forobtaining images and reproduction permissions.<P>PART; a journal of art histories and visuality<BR><P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">MANAGING EDITORS<BR></FONT COLOR>John Angeline<BR>Alan Moore<BR><P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">FEATURES EDITOR<BR></FONT COLOR>Jennifer Farrel<BR><P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">REVIEWS EDITORS<BR></FONT COLOR>Lisa Jaye Young<BR>Susan Wamsley<P></TD> <TD><speckled.jpg></TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">CALENDAR EDITORS<BR></FONT COLOR>Astrid Oviedo de Miano<BR>Stacey Williams<P><FONT COLOR="#8e236b">DESIGNER<BR></FONT COLOR>Mary Campbell<P>Many Thanks to our host <A HREF="http://www.brickhaus.com/"><font size="5"><TT> BRICKHAUS</FONT></A></TD> <TD><A HREF="p2contents.html"><IMG SRC="contentlogo.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT border="0"></A></TD> </TR> </TABLE></BODY></HTML>
