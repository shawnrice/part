What modern art meant for American               art, and what America could in turn mean for modern art, proved               productive issues for a generation of artists between the World               Wars, spawning debate and experimentation, collaboration and dissent.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Celeste Connor, in her Democratic Visions: Art and Theory of the               Stieglitz Circle, 1924-1934, conceives of the American modernism               pursued by Alfred Stieglitz and the artists he exhibited as both               an experiment in anti-academic and art-critical practice, and also               significantly as an ethic committed to social betterment. The focus               of Connor&#146;s book, her first, is the post-WWI, post-291 phase               of Stieglitz&#146;s art production and promotion. Like Sarah Greenough               and Wanda Corn, both of whom have treated this phase of Stieglitz&#146;s               influence in recent books of their own, Connor asserts a decisive               shift lead to this latter era.<sup>1</sup> If prior to 1924 Stieglitz was involved               primarily in bringing European modernism to a Manhattan audience,               by 1925, as he confided in a letter to Sherwood Anderson, he felt               modernism had become stagnant and conventional.<sup>2</sup> At the same time,               he began to gather around him a group of artists and writers, many               a generation younger than himself, who would join him in an effort               to aggressively define and promote a specifically American breed               of modernism. Critic Paul Rosenfeld&#146;s 1924 book, Port of New               York--discussed by Connor--ushered in this new phase with essays               devoted to Stieglitz, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin,               Georgia O&#146;Keeffe and other artists who Rosenfeld argued were               signs of a new spirit dawning in American life.<sup>3</sup> This tight-knit               circle also made their intentions known in the 1925 exhibit, &#147;Seven               Americans,&#148; including Demuth alongside the six artists Rosenfeld               extolled. The history of this post-1924 group--marked by its desire               to tap the potential of America through authentic artistic leadership--comprises               Connor&#146;s text.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Convincingly arguing that attention to Stieglitz&#146;s earlier               involvement with European modernism has since obscured his participation               in the fight to determine &#147;Americanness&#148; in modern art,               Connor devotes this study to the years in which the Intimate Gallery               (1925-29) and An American Place (1929-1946) were the hubs of Stieglitz&#146;s               aesthetic discourse. Connor closes her investigation in 1934, twelve               years before Stieglitz&#146;s death and the closing of An American               Place. This end date was the year Thomas Craven published Modern               Art: The Men, The Movements, The Meaning and the Stieglitz circle               collectively authored America and Alfred Stieglitz, in part as a               response to the charges levied against them in Craven&#146;s text.               1934 thus marks Connor&#146;s perceived shift toward the ascendance               of a rather more chauvinistic nationalism in the 1930s. In this               way, Connor positions her work as chronicling a moment between the               dominance of European avant-garde modernism and the backlash of               sentimental American regionalism. Further, she offers Democratic               Visions as a corrective to what she considers a standard art historical               mistake: the over-identification of Stieglitz with European modernism.               She asserts that this misconception is the legacy of the likes of               Craven, whose attempts to bolster the regionalist painters&#146;               claim to Americanness served to contest and ultimately obscure Stieglitz&#146;s               own nativist efforts.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Connor argues that Stieglitz, along with the artists and critics               in his post-1924 circle, grounded the direction of their work and               artistic identity on a democratic ideal passed down from Walt Whitman,               and updated in the contemporary criticism of Van Wyck Brooks. Rather               than the Fordist vision of American specificity current during this               period, the circle turned to democracy as a guiding principle constructing               &#147;Americanness.&#148; Connor&#146;s contribution to studies               on Stieglitz and his allies is valuable for its reminder of the               circle&#146;s sometimes-nostalgic attachments to rural life and               craft ideology. By tracing the group&#146;s theoretical foundation               to Whitman (and, at times, William Morris), Connor demonstrates               at once the circle&#146;s philosophical ambitions and their nineteenth-century               habits. Instead of a backward looking liability, Connor promotes               their attachment to Whitman--secured through artists&#146; letters               and the writings of Rosenfeld and Frank--as a sign of the group&#146;s               commitment to democracy. With this as her unifying premise, Connor               proceeds to treat a wide range of topics: the circle&#146;s authors,               Paul Rosenfeld and Waldo Frank; Stieglitz&#146;s anti-commercial               approach to selling artworks; the group&#146;s turn to &#147;New               Realism&#148; as a democratic modernist gesture; the group&#146;s               critical assessment of urban life; the group&#146;s aesthetic and               ideological attachment to rural existence; and Stieglitz&#146;s               prized artists themselves: Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden               Hartley, John Marin, Georgia O&#146;Keeffe, and Paul Strand. </p>            <p class="second"><br>              Exploring their commitment to democracy, Connor argues that in all               their pursuits, Stieglitz-circle artists sought to build a democratic               community through an American art that would act as common ground.               She further asserts, through recourse to the group&#146;s discussion               of Pueblo culture in New Mexico and their adherence to Whitman,               that the artists held a pluralistic vision of community. As such,               the circle sought to reconcile subjective expression with universal               communicability. This is a particularly compelling point, especially               as such a position would set the Stieglitz circle apart from the               contemporaneous assimilationist view of Americanness, which Connor               herself makes clear.<sup>4</sup> Connor asserts that the circle&#146;s interest               in galvanizing a common culture came as a response to immigration.               Whether they specifically had an immigrant audience in mind is not               entirely clear from Connor&#146;s history. Nonetheless, her text               includes many key ingredients for further consideration of the tensions               between pluralism and universality, including both the group&#146;s               discourse on the Southwest and their interest in folk art.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Connor&#146;s supposition that the artists sought an aesthetic that               would not merely register American democratic cohesiveness, but               in fact produce it, self-consciously denies Craven&#146;s depiction               of the circle as &#147;a group of elitist and socially disengaged               artists.&#148;<sup>5</sup> Fiercely opposed to this characterization, Connor               emphasizes Stieglitz&#146;s sense that &#147;the people would respond               if given half a chance,&#148; as he wrote to Anderson.<sup>6</sup> However,               Connor does not address the actual reception of the circle&#146;s               efforts, and in some ways this is her text&#146;s biggest handicap.               While she argues that these artists were &#147;agents in the spread               of a visual literacy that helped unify the American community in               self-awareness,&#148;<sup>7</sup> she does not account for the group&#146;s               inability to command an audience comparable to that of the New Deal               arts projects or regionalist painters. In fact, Wanda Corn reports               meager attendance to the group&#146;s inaugural 1925 show, and notes               that only one work from the exhibit sold, and that was sold to O&#146;Keeffe.               While Connor does not directly address--or even admit to--this failure               of the Stieglitz circle to construct the sort of cohesive American               society it envisioned, she perhaps gives some clue as to the reasons               for the group&#146;s failure. Noting the artists&#146; dedication               to the value of good craftsmanship, Connor argues that they presumed               a producerist viewer for their works. That is, they took for granted               that their audience would consist of individuals who themselves               made things for a living, and so would appreciate the labor of the               artist&#146;s craft. In this way, Stieglitz-circle artists failed               to adjust to what Connor argues was an increasingly consumerist               American populace. </p>            <p class="second"><br>              Connor&#146;s tight focus on the group makes for a rich historical               read. However, this is not a book to be read in isolation, but rather               as part of a rather more complex debate over the terms of American               modernism, both in the period and beyond it. Connor provides only               a slight sense of the complexities and ambivalences that marked               the field of art production, both within and without the Stieglitz               circle. Connor&#146;s constricted purview ironically treats the               group as though it were alone in its quandaries and quests, thus               furthering the very notion of the circle&#146;s exclusivity against               which Connor labors. Connor gives little voice to Stieglitz&#146;s               critics, except for her invocations of Craven and Thomas Hart Benton,               whose protests are predictably punctuated by unfortunate slurs.               This renders the only counter-discourse in the book an easily dismissed               straw man. In fact, Benton&#146;s caricature of East Coast artists               in New Mexico may be distasteful for his inclusion of &#147;priggish               aesthetes. . . and fairies&#148; among the highbrow tourists, but               he otherwise raises important questions about the problems of cultural               exchange and the status of democracy therein.<sup>8</sup> While perhaps Connor               is too quiet as to the ways in which the Stieglitz circle met defeat               and criticism, it is precisely these philosophical contests over               art and democracy that constitute the historical import of the era,               and attest to the strength of the group&#146;s democratic visions.               Patriotism, Connor&#146;s book reminds us, need not be either mindless               or sentimental. The aesthetic debates and democratic philosophy               that backed the artist practice of the Stieglitz circle indeed point               to the mental labor required not just for artistic practice, but               also for community building, and remind us also of the productive               exchange possible between the two. </p>            <p> <span class="second"><font class="second"><a href="marsh_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>               </span></p>            <p class="second"><font class="second"><a href="marsh_bio.html">Author's               Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Jennifer Marshall<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font>     </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
