Curated by Stacey B. Epstein, the exhibition               featured approximately forty paintings and works on paper, many               borrowed from museums and private collections, suggesting the broad               range of inquiry and individual responses that were characteristic               of the American encounter with cubism. Bolstered by an informative               and absorbing essay by John Cauman, the catalog is richly illustrated               with color plates of the exhibited works and supplementary images,               which provide a context for understanding the works in the exhibition               and a sense of the environment in which some of the artists worked.               Cauman&#146;s take on cubism is primarily historical; he is concerned               with showing the connections among the artists in the group, their               sponsors and patrons, and their sources in France. There is not               much new ground uncovered here, but what the catalog sets out to               do&#151;to provide an overview of critical interactions and events&#151;it               does well, particularly in the first section of Cauman&#146;s text,               which begins with a discussion of the early decampment of American               artists for Paris and the first local exhibitions of cubist painting,               particularly among the New York circle that included Max Weber,               John Marin, and Alfred Stieglitz. Proceeding chronologically, it               concludes with an account of the work of a second generation of               artists like Stuart Davis and Arshile Gorky, and the eventual reconciliation               of cubism in American museums during the interwar period, when the               first tentative efforts were made to integrate cubism, both American               and European, into the canon of art history.</p>            <p><br>              &#147;Cubism&#148; is a term that both catalog and exhibition interpret               broadly. This was very much the case during the heyday of the movement,               and if Cauman&#146;s essay seems overly attentive to the historical               and personal connections of the American school to the two leading               progenitors of cubism in Paris, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque,               it quickly comes to light that there was much more at stake in their               work than a mere absorption of the formal strategies of the Parisian               milieu. The artists were plainly taking their work in another direction,               both in their respective artistic practices and the themes and subjects               to which they gravitated. By 1913, and even more insistently in               the immediate postwar period, they had already produced a diverse               body of work and made a transition to a vocabulary that was far               more urban than the classical repertoire of bathing scenes and nudes               with which many began. This was the case with Max Weber, whose New               York Bridges, Buildings, and Subways (1912, catalogue no. 37), shown               at the exhibition, is an absolutely ebullient painting, a paean               to city progress. It could easily be a pendant to John Marin&#146;s               later New York Harbor (c.1925, cat. no. 20), a faceted watercolor               of projecting piers, dominated by the stout, opaque hull of a ship               on the water. Even Morton Schamberg&#146;s Telephone (1916, cat.               no. 30) shows a material enthrallment with mechanics that situates               it neatly in the fold of a modern, urban inventory of themes. Such               observations are familiar fare in standard accounts of this period,               and it is to the credit of the organizers of the exhibition, and               Cauman himself, that other issues are probed as well, particularly               the question of how artists like Weber, Marin, and others arrived               at cubism in the first place. As is plainly evident from the works               exhibited, they were not only reacting to having seen the work of               Picasso and Braque during their trips abroad, but also to nearly               identical sources of inspiration. As we read in the catalog, Oscar               Bluemner, Manierre Dawson, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley, Marin,               and Weber all traveled to France in the years before the First World               War, and were voracious observers of the local artistic scene. By               1905, Weber was already living in Paris, visiting the salons and               galleries regularly, where he attended C&eacute;zanne&#146;s posthumous               retrospective at the 1907 Salon d&#146;Automne. It was one of the               most influential exhibitions of its day, and Weber saw it at a time               when Picasso, and Braque in particular, were also discovering C&eacute;zanne&#146;s               work. In view of historical chronology, this makes him a contemporary               participant and not merely a subsequent imitator, as has often been               claimed.</p>            <p><br>              By 1909, we read, Weber &#147;had already begun to assimilate the               influence of Picasso,&#148; and &#147;in all likelihood&#148; had               seen two important paintings in Picasso&#146;s studio, then largely               unknown: the Demoiselles d&#146;Avignon and Three Women.1 The artist               Morgan Russell certainly had occasion to view the latter painting               at the Paris apartment of Gertrude Stein, who owned it with her               brother Leo, and he made a sketch of it, too, an intrepid and careful               study dating to 1911 (Fig. 19). It is not clear, however, that Weber               himself actually saw canonical paintings such as these first-hand,               or simply knew them from reproduction. Both appeared in Gelett Burgess&#146;s               article &#147;The Wild Men of Paris,&#148; which was published in               the Architectural Record in 1910 and was one of the first mentions               of Picasso, Braque, and their fellow French Cubists to appear in               the American press. There is little doubt that Weber saw some of               Picasso&#146;s work in Paris and met with the artist on at least               one occasion before returning to New York in early 1909, but much               of his work, and particularly that shown in the exhibition, fails               to imply such a thorough correlation. In Weber&#146;s Group of Figures               (1911, cat. no. 36), there are certain phrases that might be traced               to Picasso&#151;the cocked hip of the reclining figure in the foreground               and the pointed elbow of the thickset, standing figure, for example,               which appear in the Demoiselles d&#146;Avignon and Three Women,               respectively&#151;but here the artist emerges as much more of a               fauve. The plasticity and contour in the figure of the reclining               woman in the painting has more in common with Matisse&#146;s Blue               Nude of 1907, and here it is important to emphasize Weber&#146;s               own contact with Matisse, with whom he studied in 1908 in a school               of painting that Matisse founded with the help of two other Americans,               Michael and Sarah Stein. The displaced buttocks of the standing               figure in the left of Weber&#146;s painting, however, are an irrefutable               departure, a passage that seems almost unthinkable without Braque&#146;s               Large Nude of 1907. As in Braque&#146;s canvas, her buttocks are               brought forward to become contiguous with the profile of her extended               thigh, in a way that her pose would normally not allow. Closer to               Picasso is Man Ray, whose Cubist Figure (1913, Fig. 23) was tucked               away on one of the upper floors of the gallery during the exhibition,               the features of the figure&#146;s face aggressively dispersed. Similarly               worth taking into consideration is Man Ray&#146;s portrait of Alfred               Stieglitz (1913, Fig. 24), reproduced in the catalog, and much could               be written about the monumental A.D. MCMXIV (1914, cat. no. 19),               lent to the exhibition by the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>            <p><br>              When Weber exhibited at Stieglitz&#146;s gallery in New York in               early 1911, just before an exhibition of Picasso&#146;s works on               paper was about to open, the reaction was predictably severe. We               learn, for example, that one critic described Weber&#146;s figures               as &#147;travesties of the human form,&#148;2 a response that seems               as characteristic for its day as the random, entirely unsystematic               use of terms such as cubism, futurism, and expressionism to denote               work such as Weber&#146;s in reviews in the press. What is most               interesting about this early American reaction to cubism is how               closely it echoes public responses overseas; we could be reading               reviews from an exhibition in Berlin, Munich, Prague, or even Paris,               and easily hear similar remarks. Indeed by the time that the Armory               show opened in New York in 1913, the custom of lampooning and journalistic               reproach was so thoroughly entrenched in the press that the historical               value of this battery of rejoinders seems questionable, as does               relying on them to gauge precisely how welcoming or provincial the               local public may have been. More compelling are the designations               of cubism and its local proponents as &#147;extremist&#148; or &#147;revolutionary,&#148;               which are cited by Cauman in the catalog from period reviews.3 These               are terms that imply a political departure as well as an aesthetic               one, and were certainly relevant in the context of the first generation               of Cubists in New York. Man Ray, we learn, studied drawing at the               Francisco Ferrer Center, &#147;an institution with anarchist leanings,&#148;               and Weber also had leftist, anarchist political leanings.4 It goes               without saying that many in the local press also viewed cubism as               a &#145;foreign&#146; style, or perceived its early proponents to               be foreigners, and this too might bear further examination. Weber               emigrated from Poland at a young age, and Man Ray, although born               in the United States, courted the exotic designation; both were               of Jewish descent.</p>            <p> <br>              Cauman is not at all mistaken when he writes that in 1913, New York               &#147;remained aesthetically provincial,&#148;5 but it bears keeping               in mind that it was no more reluctant to embrace new art than other               parts of the world where the impact of cubism was felt, and probably               less so. Such admissions seem like an unnecessary concession to               the conspicuous and continual absence of American cubism from the               canon of art history and to its frequent designation as a &#145;derivative&#146;               mode of painting, at least in view of the evidence that is presented               here, which points to the contrary. Considering the account offered               in the catalog and the paintings in the exhibition, many of which               date to the period of 1909 to 1911, it does not seem warranted to               conclude that this was really the case, or that America was &#147;late               to recognize Cubism.&#148;6 In many respects, artists in the United               States were much quicker than most to recognize and react to the               new turn in painting that cubism represented. In some cases, they               were already enjoying the benefit of first-hand study in Paris at               a time when many artists abroad were still studying the work of               artists like Picasso in reproduction, or knew little about it. Cauman               appropriately gives much of the credit to the broad circle of patrons,               benefactors, and dealers who were initially supportive of cubism,               like Stieglitz, but also to its later interpreters, like Alfred               Barr. The 1936 Cubism and Abstract Art exhibition that Barr organized               at the Museum of Modern Art was one of the first institutional appraisals               of cubism in the United States, and it too was not lacking in political               overtones. Like many of his contemporaries, Barr reacted to the               rising tide of reactionary politics in Europe and its accompanying               surge in socialist realism by adopting a stance that brought him               in close agreement with many artists, like Weber, who were some               twenty years his senior: seeing in cubism an indication of not only               artistic, but also personal and social freedom,7 a marriage of terms               that surely enjoyed greater currency on the early American scene               than has been commonly acknowledged.</p>            <p> <font class="second"><a href="sawic_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="sawic_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Nicholas Sawicki<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
