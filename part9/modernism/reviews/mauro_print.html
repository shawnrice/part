That catalogue, co-authored with Terry Carbone of the Graduate Center,         offered a fresh and provocative view at issues of race, class, gender,         and ideology in Johnson&#146;s so-called &#147;genre&#148; paintings.         Indeed, it is typical of Hills to inject intellectual life and political         relevancy into art historical topics often thought to be banal or populist,         such as nineteenth-century American genre painting.</p>      <p class="second">With her newly edited anthology, Modern Art in the U.S.A.,         Hills amasses a wide range of reproduced primary source documents. Historically,         they cover the entirety of the twentieth century in the United States,         from Robert Henri&#146;s c.1910 Whitmanesque reckoning with the question         of a &#147;national&#148; American art to more contemporary writings by         and interviews with critics, historians, curators, and artists in the         late 1990&#146;s.</p>      <p class="second">While this is an anthology, it is still obviously possible         to evaluate the editor&#146;s inclusions, omissions, and contextualization.         On these counts, Hills succeeds marvelously. Her brief introductory essays         at the start of each section (which are divided both chronologically and         conceptually) and before individual documents are informative for both         students of American art and more general readers. She discusses the political         and ideological context of each document as well as its art-historical         significance. For example, with respect to the aforementioned Henri writing,         she discusses the text as both a reaction to the criticisms of the early         exhibitions of The Eight by Progressive Era writers and in the larger         context of that era&#146;s mass immigration and economic and political         expansionism.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Perhaps what is most unique and appealing about this small paperback volume,         however, is the author&#146;s use of rare and/or unlikely facsimile archival         documents. For instance, she goes beyond normal anthology-type materials         in her inclusion of poetry and historic photographs from events as diverse         as the Armory Show (1913) and Carolee Schneemann&#146;s Meat Joy (1964).         Hills also includes facsimiles of surprising primary sources such as Duchamp&#146;s         brief statement &#147;The Richard Mutt Case&#148; from the journal Blind         Man (1917) and J. Edgar Hoover&#146;s confidential FBI file on artist/activist         Ben Shahn (1951). More recent facsimile reproductions include Maciunas&#146;s         &#147;Fluxus Manifesto&#148; (1963), a multi-page magazine exposition         of James Luna&#146;s performance Artifact Piece (1986), and several Guerilla         Girls posters (1988-9).</p>      <p class="second"><br>        In terms of her choices of inclusion, Hills covers not only a wide range         chronologically, but also racially, methodologically, and ideologically.         We are treated to excerpts from an array of sources such as art historian&#146;s         Marcos S&aacute;nchez-Tranquilino&#146;s writings on Chicano art to Suzanne         Lacy&#146;s personal letter to Hills describing that artist&#146;s own         feminist performances to a recent interview with artist/curator Fred Wilson.<br>        Hills&#146;s anthology is definitely worth a close look. Its diverse archival         material makes it a valuable addition to a personal library and its small         size and paperback format render it affordable.</p>      <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
