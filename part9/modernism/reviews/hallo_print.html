Commercialism,         industrialization, and prosperity became the defining aspects of American         culture, and artists on both sides of the Atlantic were struggling to         come to terms with the change. The skyscraper, the new emblem of American         ambition and success, replaced the cowboy who had once symbolized the         country and its endless frontier.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        The art world itself was also changing during these decades. The one-way         tide of American artists traveling abroad to study and soak up culture         had begun to give way to a more equal cross-cultural exchange. European         artists, both fascinated and repelled by the changing face of the United         States, were eager to cross the Atlantic in order to see for themselves         New York and its modern marvels, the skyscrapers, the bridges, the unabashed         commercialism. Alfred Stieglitz&#146;s galleries and the 1913 Armory Show         had served to establish New York as the country&#146;s center of modern         art and the avant-garde, setting the stage for later artistic rivalries         between Paris and New York. No longer were European artists ignoring America;         after World War I artistic traffic began to travel both ways. </p>      <p class="second"><br>        In her book The Great American Thing: Modern Art and National Identity,         1915-1935, Corn looks at various attempts by artists during this period         to visually redefine the United States by creating a new style of art         that was both American and modern. The study is divided into four sections.         In the Introduction, Corn uses Paul Rosenfeld&#146;s book Port of New         York (1924) to outline the issues that form the basis of her investigation.         Parts I and II are composed of seven &#147;case studies,&#148; individual         paintings by seven different artists that serve &#147;to uncover the roots&#148;         of what she describes as an &#147;exceptionalist discourse in American         arts and letters&#148; (p. xiv). Part I focuses on the &#147;transatlantics,&#148;         those artists, both European and American, who traveled across the ocean         in search of inspiration and a first-hand look at American culture. Examining         specific works by Marcel Duchamp, Gerald Murphy, and Joseph Stella, the         author attempts to achieve a better understanding of cross-cultural exchange.         In Part II, Corn looks at one painting each by Charles Demuth, Georgia         O&#146;Keeffe, and Charles Sheeler, modern artists working in local or         &#147;rooted&#148; traditions. In the epilogue, Corn &#147;points to the         ways these tensions [between the lure of Europe and the desire to make         New York the new center of the art world] and bold claims for national         art persisted in later American art movements&#148; (p. xix). </p>      <p class="second"><br>        In the introduction, Corn formulates the scholarly method that she will         follow throughout her study, namely considering the works of painters,         sculptors, photographers, and writers in light of contemporary social,         political, and economic factors. For example, she credits international         politics with engendering artistic exchange between Paris and New York         in the years immediately following the first World War. &#147;Such encouragement         from France characterized the wartime Franco-American alliance, which         depended on imagery that constructed the relationship between the two         countries as one of parent to child. Europe . . . was the old, worn-out         parent culture, America the enviable young and innocent child that had         not yet exercised its muscles in the arts. This new international partnership         . . . fueled the budding nationalism of New York intellectuals and artists         like Paul Rosenfeld and deeply influenced creative work done in New York         over the next two decades&#148; (p. 11). Corn&#146;s interdisciplinary         and in-depth cultural readings of works by modern artists working both         at home and abroad reveal that, despite differences in style, these artists         had a common goal: to reflect the America of the twentieth century in         a modern way that was worthy of its subject. By organizing each chapter         around a specific work of art, first examining it formally and iconographically,         then drawing out the connections between it and its context, Corn renders         more manageable the challenge of understanding this dense period of American         cultural development.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Indeed, paring down complex issues in order to arrive at central conclusions         about her topic is a strategy that Corn uses throughout the study, sometimes         to her detriment. In the introduction, for example, she states that she         will use a commonly understood vocabulary, and asks that &#147;terms such         as &#145;modernism,&#146; &#145;avant-garde,&#146; and &#145;America&#146;         . . . be taken in their most commonly used and accepted meanings&#148;         (p. xvii). While this strategy enables the author to make her points succinctly,         without the need for numerous qualifying statements and explanations,         it also ignores many of the recent questions that emerged in art history         since the 1970s. Revisionist historians who have thrown out the traditional         definition of &#147;America&#148; in favor of new definitions that acknowledge         the multiplicity of American experiences will, I expect, find themselves         perplexed when confronted with Corn&#146;s claims for the essential &#147;Americanness         of American culture.&#148; <br>        Likewise, traditional definitions of &#147;modernism&#148; and the &#147;avant-garde&#148;         have been dissected by recent generations of historians, including Michael         Leja, who concludes that the term avant-garde &#147;has been subjected         to considerable abuse&#148; (Reframing Abstract Expressionism, New Haven:         Yale University Press, 1993, p. 21). In her introduction, Corn discusses         Stieglitz and the role that he played in introducing the American public         to modern European art, referring to him and his circle of artists as         undeniably avant-garde. While Corn&#146;s analysis of Stieglitz&#146;s         role in promoting the artists in his circles, particularly her distinction         between the two different circles that surrounded him during the period,         certainly contributes to our understanding of the emergence of the &#147;Great         American Thing,&#148; she fails to address the larger question that Leja         raised in 1993&#150; namely, was the Stieglitz Circle truly avant-garde?         Leja defined avant-gardism as &#147;really an alternative form of academicism,         one demanding novelty and experimentation&#148; (Reframing Abstract Expressionism,         p. 22). Both he and Meyer Schapiro before him stated that the United States         offered no strong academic tradition against which an avant-garde could         define itself, thereby problematizing the entire notion of an American         avant-garde. Does the fact that Stieglitz exhibited and published the         works of the European avant-garde make his own circle avant-garde? Corn         chooses not to enter into this debate. </p>      <p class="second"><br>        Race is another issue that Corn chooses not to investigate in this volume.         Of the book&#146;s seven modernist &#147;case studies,&#148; she does         not include any non-white artists, amounting to a virtual disavowal of         the importance of the Harlem Renaissance and the New Negro Movement in         shaping American visual culture. Why does Corn choose Gerald Murphy&#146;s         Razor, one of only sixteen identified paintings by an artist whose career         is known for its brevity, as one of her &#147;transatlantic&#148; case         studies? Why not look instead at Palmer Hayden&#146;s Nous Quatre &agrave;         Paris (1935), a painting in the modern style by a prolific African-American         artist that documents the Negro Colony of artists in Paris during the         twenties and thirties? Recent publications including Sharon Patton&#146;s         African-American Art (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press,1998)         serve as important surveys of the rich history of African-American visual         culture. Until these artists are accepted and integrated into the larger         history of American art, however, their most significant contributions         will continue to be overlooked.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Overall, Corn&#146;s book provides a useful addition to the literature         on early twentieth-century American art. It is thoroughly researched,         well written, and richly illustrated. By working from a small group of         case studies, and building her argument outward using contemporary literature,         politics, economics, and social factors to illuminate their significance,         Corn has written a volume that will be of interest not only to art historians,         but to all scholars of twentieth-century American cultural history. </p>      <p> <span class="second"><font class="second"><a href="hallo_bio.html">Author's         Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> </span> </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
