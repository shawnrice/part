Here in the eight examples of his early figural style               we not only can find suggestions of abstract elements that dominate               his later canvasses, but we can also look at the subjects depicted               as autobiographical references to the artist and his environment               at a specific time and place in history. On a biographical level               they can be seen as true extensions of Franz Kline's life. His wife,               Elizabeth Kline, observed that &#147;Kline was a painter of his               own life.&#148;<sup>2</sup> Underlying the portrayals of naked women, sexy               singers, jazz musicians and circus performers are Kline's personal               identifications with the subject matter and contemporary themes.               Kline's personal occupation with such subjects as movies and movie-stars               can be seen as being reflective of his place in society and of his               relationship to the current trends of popular culture. On a historical               level the subject matter of the murals can be seen as depicting               fragments of the American cultural scene, embracing the new imagery               created by Hollywood, and re-creating an accurate rendition of burlesque,               as it existed in New York City in the mid-thirties. Finally, beyond               the significance of the imagery and subject matter presented in               the Bleeker Street Tavern murals, key stylistic elements, most notably               the treatment of line and brushstroke, can be seen as clear reflections               of the later Abstract Expressionist works that established and defined               Kline&#146;s artistic career.</p>            <p><br>              Kline came to New York in 1938, after spending time studying art               in London, and settled into life as a struggling artist in New York&#146;s               Greenwich Village. Despite monetary difficulties associated with               the bohemian and artistic life in New York, Kline was able to continue               to paint while working odd jobs, such as frame-making and carpentry,               in order to pay the rent and support his new bride, Elizabeth Vincent               Parsons.<sup>3</sup> In 1940 Kline was hired by the owner of a local watering               hole on Bleeker Street, the Bleeker Street Tavern, to paint a series               of decorative murals to enhance the atmosphere and promote a more               lively and exciting atmosphere in his popular but assuming bar in               Greenwich Village. Kline was instructed by the owner to &#147;Paint               me girls!&#148;<sup>4</sup> The desire to have &#147;girls&#148; covering the               walls of his pleasure establishment could be seen both as a business               effort to create a decorative environment that would primarily attract               male patrons.<sup>5</sup> Kline was paid five dollars a piece, plus canvas,               to do ten panels which he filled with vivid scenes of half-naked               women, circus performers, masqueraded figures, voluptuous dancers,               and costumed men.<sup>6</sup></p>            <p><br>              At first glance these bold images can be understood as accurate               graphic depictions of the cast of characters appearing in burlesque               shows, a popular and appealing form of entertainment in the post-Depression               era. The bleak spirit and financial hardship of the times gave rise               to a letdown of sexual barriers and audiences were drawn to inexpensive               &#147;entertainments of a light and not-too intellectual activity&#148;               that provided a good distraction from their troubles.<sup>7</sup> For little               money one could go to the burlesque shows and spend the day watching               a variety of routines ranging from the comic to the seductive. Burlesque               shows were intended primarily for men who wanted some sexual excitement,               and to see a sexy show. In 1937 live burlesque performances were               banned in New York City through the enactment of a municipal ordinance.               Therefore the provocative as well as evocative imagery featured               in the Bleeker Street Tavern murals panels can be seen as intentional               visual and emotional replacements for the sights, sounds and actions               of a live burlesque show.<sup>8</sup> Most importantly, the explicit displays               of nudity and insinuating sexual stunts would have been enticing               elements that would attract more patrons to the premises, as desired               by the owner.</p>            <p><br>              After 1937, in order to see any live burlesque acts, it was necessary               for pleasure-seeking New Yorkers to cross the Hudson River and go               to such places as Union City, New Jersey. The visual elements of               Kline&#146;s compositions strongly indicate that he himself made               such journeys and that he was familiar with the presentation methods,               theatrical moments and other intriguing characteristics of live               burlesque acts. However, a second glance at the iconography of the               murals also reveals recognizable symbols of contemporary popular               culture to which Kline had a strong personal affinity.</p>            <p><br>              Living in New York, in the artistic and cultural enclave of Greenwich               Village, Kline availed himself of many of the popular forms of entertainment               available. Kline was an avid movie-buff, frequently visiting the               Waverly Theater on Sixth Avenue.<sup>9</sup> Kline&#146;s fascination with               Hollywood and its imagery, specifically the movie star, was reflective               of another significant and influential popular entertainment that               captured the interest and imagination of Americans, and by the 1930s               had become an integral and familiar part of the New York streetscape.               The popular imagery exported from Hollywood was evident in many               streetscapes of New York.<sup>10</sup> As a New Yorker, Kline would have been               familiar with the billboards and hundreds of studio-produced photographs               that advertised and promoted the newest screen idol, and lined movie               theater corridors, entryways and marques. Also, as an artist, he               would have been familiar with the work of Reginald Marsh, who by               the mid-thirties had already gained acclaim for his graphic and               colorful depictions of Hollywood-style entertainments that populated               the New York cultural scene, capturing the effects and vibrant presence               of the movies and burlesque shows on the New York streets.11 However,               while similar energy and imagery are repeated by Kline, it should               be noted that Kline did not really favor the graphic descriptions               of the city by Reginald Marsh because he felt &#147;they lacked               an emotional depth.&#148;<sup>12</sup></p>            <p><br>              Having identified the possible sources for the imagery contained               within the Bleeker Street Tavern murals we can turn our attention               to a discussion of the specific images contained within each of               the individual panels. The order in which the ten panels were originally               displayed is not known. However, we can attempt to organize them               based on reconstructive description of a contemporary burlesque               show in a New York theater before 1937, with each of the eight surviving               panels viewed as individual acts. In the 1930s, such theatrical               performances were described as &#147;plotless musical entertainments               consisting of a series of unrelated episodes and dances&#148; with               the main attraction and specific purpose of each successive act               being to depict or suggest subjects or objects of a sexual interest.<sup>13</sup></p>            <p><br>              Kline's &#147;burlesque show&#148; conceivably began with the solo               singer, as shown in the work Hot Jazz (Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk,               Virginia). [Fig. 1] This canvas captures all of the sensational               and alluring elements of the opening act of a live show. The importance               of the live performance was the singer's appearance with a focus               on her curvaceous shape and her subtle bodily movements being of               special interest and allure. She would always be &#147;strictly               a blond&#148; and dressed in a revealing garment.<sup>14</sup> This description               fits the strawberry blond female vocalist featured in Hot Jazz.               Adorned in a blue strapless gown and centrally positioned in the               composition as the star attraction, she can be seen as the embodiment               of the ideal burlesque model.</p>            <p><br>              However, this representation of the &#147;femme fatale&#148; also               has physical characteristics of the screen heroine of the thirties               and forties. &#147;Packaged to present the American male's ideal               of femininity, they were equa1 parts baby-doll, siren, and bombshell...platinum               blond-golden haired saints, bottled blonds with painted lips like               Jean Harlow or Mae West in the thirties, and Rita Hayworth and Lana               Turner in the forties.&#148;<sup>15</sup> Specifically, the body posture, golden               hair, and dress draw close comparison to a publicity photograph               of Rita Hayworth in the movie Gilda.<sup>16</sup> The identification of the               burlesque performer in the guise of a famous movie-star clearly               reflects Kline's own personal interest in the cinema. Another element               of popular culture and personal relevance to Kline&#146;s life and               interests is the jazz band positioned on the right side of the vocalist.<br>              Beginning with Guy Lombardo's introduction of Rudee Vallee at the               Hotel Roosevelt in 1929, the solo vocalist became a necessary adjunct               of a jazz dance band. Moving from the clubs that thrived in Harlem               in the twenties, the jazz band became a staple for every good singer               and every decent nightclub. By the early forties jazz had become               an established musical taste in New York and Kline could have heard               jazz played all over town, in clubs from Broadway to Greenwich Village.<sup>17</sup>               However, while the jazz band would have been a staple of the cultural               scene, it would not have been part of a genuine burlesque show in               New York. The musical component of a live burlesque show was a pit               orchestra playing from below the stage. Therefore, the jazz band               in Hot Jazz can once again be seen as a reflection of Kline's own               interest in jazz and on a broader scale a statement about New York               culture.</p>            <p><br>              In a burlesque show, upon completion of the first act, concluding               with the solo song, the female vocalist would strip and the next               segment would be immediately introduced so as to continue the momentum               and excitement. The next skit would be considered as an &#147;hors               d'oeuvre&#148; between acts, while the patrons anxiously awaited               the appearance of the next stripper. It would also add variety to               the show by focusing on depictions of comic characters rather than               sexual ones. One type of comic character would be a straight man,               purposely singing a number off-key and out of tune.<sup>18</sup> In the Bleeker               Street Tavern murals this act was represented by the panel Singing               Waiter. Once again, as in a live performance, the tuxedoed singer               in Kline's work would have been the singer at a microphone who moved               from table to table around the room crooning a song intended for               lovers. However, Kline added a further comic element to the pose               of this traveling waiter, who precariously tilts his tray towards               the comatose pair of lovers at the table in the foreground.<sup>19</sup> This               bit of clumsy humor could be seen as indicative of Kline's own cynic               attitude, developed at an early age as a cartoonist and in later               years re-emerging in the perceived role of a comedian.<sup>20</sup> The idea               of the comic would be continued in subsequent acts that focused               on circus themes.</p>            <p><br>              Circus themes were popular subjects for burlesque performances.               Often a &#147;Circus Theme Day&#148; would be held in which all               the vocal, dance and comic acts would relate to the circus. The               focus of folly was sexual, but the presentations contained all the               essential circus characters, from the comedic clown, the ring master,               and the daring show girl. Male clowns would be seen as the comic               characters and women would be seen as the horses, holding the key               accessory of the ring master, the whip.<sup>21</sup> In the burlesque circus               presentation, the whip also became a necessary accoutrement for               the leading lady, enabling her to assume the powerful role of the               sexual enticer and lead the performance on a planned course. In               the panel Circus Rider, Kline represents the circus theme by showing               a female bareback rider astride a horse holding on to a gallantly               dressed male companion.<sup>22</sup> In this depiction the coarseness and vulgarity               of the subject matter is transformed into an artistic performance               of skill and grace. This sense of gentility can be discerned in               the balletic pose of the woman who is fully dressed in a dance costume.               Dance numbers were often choreographed to further interest patrons,               with movements and positions being seen as &#147;symbolic imitations               of suggestions of the sex act.&#148;<sup>23</sup> Often, in order to increase               the sense of &#147;the charming, the erotic [and) the daring&#148;               a foreign Spanish flavor was added.<sup>24</sup> In the work Apache Dancers               this Spanish element is clearly expressed both in the costumes and               scenic background. The man on the right, dressed in a dark suit               and wearing a hat, can be seen as the &#147;matador&#148; who points               his sword towards the woman, or the bull on the right. The background               setting can be seen as being representative of the architectural               elements of a bull stadium in Spain, with the arched columned structure               serving as a protective device to separate the spectators in their               seats from the perceptively dangerous action in the center ring.<sup>25</sup></p>            <p><br>              The foreign and exotic elements of the burlesque show reappeared               in other Bleeker Street Tavern panels that included dance themes,               and also reflected the sophisticated audience of gentleman who patronized               burlesque theaters. In Dancer in a Red Skirt, the startling half-nude               female figure is surrounded by men wearing berets and top hats.               However, the focus of the entire scene remains the sparsely attired               female performer, who is lifted above the crowds displaying her               exposed breasts.<sup>26</sup> Her elevated position reflected another New York               City ordinance of the mid-thirties that allowed women to be elevated,               but not to be physically touched. It also serves to highlight her               theatrical role as a tableau or show-girl, and not just an object               of desire. The fact that she bares her breasts was actually inconsequential               to the overall effect of the entire burlesque show, and often the               action itself would not receive much applause.<sup>27</sup> The burlesque patron               was not titillated by nudity alone, but by the salaciousness accompanying               the show. While the show-girl&#146;s performance was indeed able               to command the attention of the audience, it was the torso dancer               &#147;who invit[ed] immediate concentration.&#148;<sup>28</sup> The torso dancer               would appear in the finale act, parading on a diagonal path back               and forth across the stage, the exposure of breasts by extending               her arm over her head and towards the audience would be the final               act of the whole burlesque show.<sup>29</sup></p>            <p><br>              Such a figure and pose is depicted by Kline in the panel Masked               Ball. In this composition, the movement of the dancer is echoed               in the diagonal forms and lines that dominate the scene, painterly               techniques and forms that dominate Kline&#146;s later abstract works.               The degree of attraction that the torso dancer holds is shown in               the man on the right who, in violation of decency laws, touches               her breast. The elongated noses, blocked out teeth, and distorted               mouths of the performers, further exaggerated by heavily applied               make-up, were part of the comic effect built into the burlesque               performance.<sup>30</sup> The characters depicted in Masked Ball draw comparisons               to the costumed revelers that would attend masquerades and costume               balls that became popular charity events in the 1930s.<sup>31</sup> The mixture               of comic and carnivalesque caricatures clearly reflected in The               Masked Ball further supports the notion that the Bleeker Street               Tavern murals were a combination of popular ideas reflective of               the world around Kline, and those that were part of his own personal               world.</p>            <p><br>            </p>            <table width="129" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="219">              <tr>                 <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/modernism/articles/josel_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=450')"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/modernism/articles/josel_2.jpg" width="180" height="209" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="josel_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b> Dancing Couple.

(Private Collection, New York)               [Fig. 2] This particular work stands out as an anomaly in comparison               with the subjects and themes presented in the other panel, in that               none of the imagery can be related to burlesque or any other contemporary               cultural trend. Instead, the work can be interpreted as a very personal               tribute to his wife Elizabeth, a dancer.<sup>32</sup> The left foreground               of the composition is dominated by a couple dancing. The woman is               wearing a ballet costume and the man appears to have a beard. However,               it is the adoring gaze of the man, and not his dress that attracts               attention, suggesting that this figure is actually Kline and the               woman of adoration, his wife. Such a close relationship between               the figures is further suggested by their intimate pose, which is               spotlighted by a strong diagonal ray of light that emanates from               the second story of the room and crosses the dance floor to the               couple. This bright light creates the illusion that they are the               only ones dancing in the room, which appears to be more like a dance               hall than a burlesque stage. This particular work also exhibits               some of the key elements of Kline&#146;s later abstract works.</p>            <p><br>              In considering the place of the Bleeker Street Tavern murals in               Kline&#146;s artistic development, it is clear that they are more               than just wall decorations with personal sentiments. Stylistically,               they contain the seeds for Kline's later abstract works.<sup>33</sup>               Specifically, the painterly technique and compositional organization               of the individual panels, with strong diagonal emphasis, indicate               that he was already experimenting with concepts of space, line,               form, and color as if he &#147;were testing what was possible or               impossible.&#148;<sup>34</sup> The organization of the individual               compositions also expresses Kline&#146;s interest in spatial depth.               In most of the panels, the figural images are positioned in the               foreground space, amplifying their specific characteristics while               creating a discernible background space. This sense of spatial dimensions               is clearly shown in the work Dancing Couple where the couple is               pushed into the left hand corner, their legs cut-off by the bottom               edge of the canvas, leaving the right side of the canvas open and               accessible to the back of the room. In the work Hot Jazz, the spatial               construction can also be described as having a baroque sensibility.               The singer occupies a central space and serves as an intermediary               scale between the foreground and background space. The composition               &#147;zooms in and out of scale steadied by the quick frontal poise               of the singer's outstretched hand.&#148;<sup>35</sup> This &#147;baroque&#148;               pictorial style can also be seen in the out-flung arms of the torso               dancer in Masked Ball. However, in this panel, the swirling motions               of the dancer create the sensation of a continuous flow between               foreground and background space, as well as producing a burst of               energy that moves out beyond the edge of the canvas.<sup>36</sup>               Such pulsating energy also emanates from the radiating gesture of               the singer and is echoed by the profusion of diagonal and curvilinear               lines which fill the canvas and move beyond the outer edges. In               all of the Bleeker Street Tavern mural panels, both diagonal and               curvilinear lines are also used to create form and volume. The contours               of the figural images are drawn with fluid black lines that help               accentuate the volumes of the bodies, and this attracts further               attention to anatomical details that are so important to the understanding               of the subject matter. Abstract forms are also created by swabs               of bold colors, held together by faint drawing lines that express               their own energy and emotion. Both the color and emotional content               of the panels can be seen as oppositional. The autumnal colors of               restrained reds, bright oranges, and darker browns produces both               a gentle sadness as well as a dynamic sense of violence, that, like               his later abstract work, is left to the viewer to discern.<sup>37</sup></p>            <p><br>              Franz Kline's art occupies a unique position in American Modernism,               particular in tracing the roots of the New York School of painters               in the 1940s. The Bleeker Street Tavern murals stand out as expressions               of his own artistic philosophy and as reflections of his life experiences               as they related to the world around him and his own self-perceptions.               In the murals, he was on stage at last with all his paraphernalia,               gathered from his past educational training and his early observations               and participation in the cultural life of New York City. The Bleeker               Street Tavern murals are significant works in the repertoire of               Kline and can be seen both as a summary of Kline's early artistic               interests as well as an indication of his future &#147;modern&#148;               style. They also become significant as documentary depictions of               the popular cultural environment that dominated a specific time               and place in America. In studying these works, both biography and               history become indispensable research tools that not only reveal               personal associations of the artist, but also those that were shared               by a broad public audience and still have an intriguing appeal.             </p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="josel_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p> <font class="second"><a href="josel_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Evie T.
