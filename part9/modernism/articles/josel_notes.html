According to               Elaine de Kooning, one day Franz Kline visited a friend at his studio               and viewed one of his own drawings magnified on a wall through a               Bell-Opticon projector. She wrote &quot;from that day, his style               of painting changed completely. It was a total and instantaneous               conversion, demanding...a completely different method of working               with a completely different attitude...Any allegiance to formalized               representation was wiped out of his consciousness. The work from               this moment, contradicts in every way all of the work that preceded               it, and from which it had so logically and organically grown.&quot;               [See Elaine de Kooning in Franz Kline Memorial Exhibition. (Washington,               D.C.: Washington Gallery of Modern Art ,1962): 14.] In contrast,               Alfred Boime viewed Kline's artistic development and his arrival               as a painstaking evolution, also traceable to the earliest drawings.               [Alfred Boime in Franz Kline: The Early Work as Signals(Binghamton,               New York, University Art Gallery and Purchase, New York, The Neuberger               Museum: 1977):1.] Harry Gaugh also maintained that Kline's abstraction               was the result of a stylistic evolution based on the fusion of drawing               and painting. [Harry F. Gaugh, <i>Franz Kline's Romantic Abstraction,</i>               Artforum 13, no.10 (Summer 1975): 28.]<br>            </p>            <p>2 Kline's wife made this statement in a letter to editor of Art               News, correcting a remark made earlier by the artist Elaine de Kooning,               who had earlier expressed the opinion that &quot;any extension of               visual activity... into biography [in Kline s work] would appear               to be falsifications.&quot; In her letter, Mrs. Kline reaffirmed               that biography was an essential element in the thematic development               of his art &quot;far more so than anyone realized.&quot; [Elizabeth               Kline, <i>Letter to the Editor,</i> Art News 61 (January 1963):               6.] <br>            </p>            <p>3 According to Harry Gaugh, Kline and his wife moved often, living               in various walk-up apartments and lofts in Greenwich Village. However,               he did not specify if such moves were for financial reasons. [See               Harry F. Gaugh, <i>Franz Kline: The Man and the Myths, </i>Art News,               84, no. 10 (December 1985): 63.] <br>            </p>            <p>4 &quot;Review of Collector's Gallery Exhibition&quot; Arts 35               (January 1961): 50. Although Kline faced great financial hardship,               the Bleeker Street Tavern Murals were not &quot;purely commercial               jobs&quot; which he did in order to make ends meet, as was suggested               in <i>Painstaking Slapdash: Review of Whitney Retrospective of Franz               Kline</i>, Time Magazine, 11 October 1968. The painter James Brooks               also referred to Kline's early works as &quot;buckeye paintings&quot;               which helped to pay the rent. [Harry F. Gaugh, The Vital Gesture:               Franz Kline in Retrospective (New York: Abbeville Press, 1985):               17.] Kline's acceptance of such commissions ask the Bleeker Street               murals was defended by his colleague Elaine de Kooning. According               to de Kooning, Kline was not drawn to art as a way of life, but               was driven to it by &quot;the joy of the activity itself,&quot;               which resulted in his acceptance of any kind of project. &quot;In               fact,&quot; wrote de Kooning, &quot;a subject was necessary to set               his ideasYin motion.&quot; [Elaine de Kooning, Franz Kline Memorial               Exhibition: 13.] Early in his career, Kline was also fortunate to               acquire two important patrons, Dr. Theodore Edlich, whom he met               in London in 1936, and I. David Orr, an industrialist whom he met               during his first big break in New York. Both Ed1ich and Orr became               both close friends and influential patrons in their financial support               and promotion of Kline's career. Both commissioned as well as bought               numerous works. Orr owned more than 150 paintings of Kline's in               the forties, and Edlich, who served as Kline's personal physician               bought 35 works during his lean years.

In his painting, Street Scene,               Greenwich Village, 1943 (Collection: Dr. T. Edlich), amidst the               thick gestural lines and solid forms, the central building with               a peaked roof can be identified as the Waverly Theater on Sixth               Avenue, off 4th Street. <br>            </p>            <p>10 See Marilyn Cohen, Reginald Marsh's New York (New York: Whitney               Museum of Art and Dover Publications, 1983): 13. Kline's fascination               with Hollywood and its imagery was reflective of America's pre occupation               with Hollywood. This trend was noted in 1938 by Sheldon Cheney who               observed &quot;It would be absurd to maintain that art claims the               attention of the mass of American people as do such major interests               as...Hollywood romance...[and the] comics.&quot; [See Sheldon Cheney,               <i>Art in the United States</i>, in America Now: An Inquiry into               Civilization in the United States, ed. Harold E. Stearns (New York:               Scribner's &amp; Sons, 1938): 82.] Kline was also known to have               thought of himself as a Hollywood actor. Not only did he bare an               uncanny resemblance to the British actor Ronald Colman, but he also               possessed many qualities of the Hollywood actor: &quot;a bravado,               the ability to attract women, and the poise to hold an audience.&quot;               Kline's friend Fielding Dawson recalled an episode in which, &quot;Suddenly               I saw him-his face was theatrical; he looked like Ronald Colman.               I cried.

You look like-Ronald Colman!&quot; [Fielding Dawson,               An Emotional Memoir of Franz Kline (New York: Pantheon Books. 1967):               19.]<br>            </p>            <p>11 For example, in such works as Down at Jimmy Kelly's, 1936 (Norfolk,Virginia:               The Chrysler Museum) and Minsky's Chorus,1935 (Private Collection)               Marsh successfully captured the physical and energetic action of               burlesque shows at some of New York's most illustrious nightclubs.               In other works, such as Twenty Cent Movie, 1936 (New York: Whitney               Museum of American Art) and Paramount Pictures, 1934 (Private Co11ection),               the allure of Hollywood is descriptively shown in the advertisements               that plaster the entrances of the movie house, and by the female               figures who convey the glamorous image of the Hollywood starlet.               <br>            </p>            <p>12 John Gordon, Franz Kline: 1910-1962 (New York: The Whitney Museum               of Art, 1968): 9. Alfred Boime suggested that the voluptuous dancers,               burlesque queens, and vocalist appearing in the Bleeker Street Tavern               Murals Aspring directly from the theatrical scenes of Reginald Marsh.               [Boime, Franz Kline: 9.] For further comparisons between Marsh and               Kline see Boime, Franz Kline: 8-9.<br>            </p>            <p>13 Dressler, <i>Burlesque as a Cultural Phenomenon</i>: 19. </p>            <p>14 Alexander, Strip-Tease: 107. The actual burlesque performance               began with a solo singing number introduced by a female chorus singing               a song that would be recognizable to the audience. The songs were               usually current ones and they were meant to be sexually explicit               and to be delivered in a very blunt manner. [Dressler, <i>Burlesque as a Cultural Phenomenon</i>: 20] &quot;After...the chorus goes               backstage a bit...a singing woman will come forward...sing[ing]               in an untrained, off-key voice, a song to which no one listens,               the attention being riveted on her body and its movements.

[Boime, Franz Kline: 5.] Due to the popular appeal of cartoons               in the late teens and early twenties, the cartoon artist received               a great deal of public recognition. A good cartoonist's work appeared               in several newspapers and magazines that were mass-distributed across               America, bringing fame and notoriety to the artist. Kline's model               cartoonist was John Held, Jr. who became very popular during the               Depression for his depictions of the good and easy life of the passing               twenties.

[The connection between               Expressionism and Kline's work is first noted in <i>Review</i>,               Arts (1961): 10.] While Masked Ball could be compared to Emil Nolde's               work Dancers, 1920, in terms of the figural depictions and the palette,               the ideas of Kline's panel can be more closely linked to burlesque               motifs, rather than to the philosophy of Expressionism. Furthermore,               in terms of the present Kline literature, it would be difficult               to identify any possible connections that Kline might have had with               the German Expressionist movement.<br>            </p>            <p>31 Such an example would be the Masquerade Costume Ball and Dance               of 1937, a notable event sponsored by the Federation of Works Progress               Administrators (W.P.A.), Supervisors Council of New York to benefit               its emergency fund for artists. Advertised as &quot;a gala evening               of gaiety and intrigue in a real carnival spirit-ingenious, comic               and daring,&quot; such evenings would have drawn crowds from the               creative and artistic worlds (Advertisement from the author's own               collection). <br>            </p>            <p>32 Prior to their marriage, Elizabeth Kline was a dancer and it               was probably through her that Kline became familiar with pictures               of the great Russian dancer Nijinsky as the clown Petrouchka, an               image that he became intrigued with. [See photograph reproduced               in Gaugh, Vital Gesture: 67.] Not only did Kline paint several portraits               of Nijinsky in this famous role, but he also incorporated similar               formal structure in his own self-portraits. Kline's personal attachment               towards Nijinsky and his personal infatuation with this mythic dancer               have been discussed and analyzed by contemporary colleagues and               scholars, including Elaine de Kooning and Robert Motherwell, who               recognized and compared Kline's feelings of loneliness and alienation               to those depicted by Nijinsky in the role of Petrouchka. [See Elaine               de Kooning, Franz Kline Memorial Exhibition: 13; and Tribute by               Robert Motherwell, TMs, Artist File: Franz Kline, Collection of               Museum of Modern Art Library, New York). Gaugh also suggested that               Kline's feelings of loneliness were related to his role as an artist.               &quot;In spite of his gregarious, carousing, conversation-spinning               nature, he was convinced that all artist's are lonely.&quot; [Gaugh,               &quot;Man and Myths&quot;: 62.] Finally, according to his friends,               Kline loved to dance. One friend, Charlotte Brooks, recalled that               &quot;he had lots of arms when he danced, and that he was a born               performer.&quot; [Ibid., 65.]<br>            </p>            <p>33 As Clement Greenberg observed, the Bleeker Street panels &quot;show               the artist already possessed the ambition and energy that were to               explode into [his] dramatic...abstractions a decade later.&quot;               <i>Review</i> <i>Arts </i>(1961): 50. <br>            </p>            <p>34 Ibid.<br>              <br>              35 Bill Berkson, &quot;Kline's True Colors,&quot; Art in America               74, no.10 (October. 1986): 143. <br>            </p>            <p>36 Gordon, Franz Kline: 1910-1962:12-13.<br>            </p>            <p>37 According to Kline &quot;The final test of painting, theirs               or mine is does the painter's emotion come across?&quot; [Selden               Rodman, &quot;An Important Abstractionist,&quot; Cosmopolitan (February               1959): 67.]</p>            <p> <font class="second"><a href="josel.html">Back to Article&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Evie T.
