As Maurice Tuchman notes in The Spiritual               in Art (1986), &#147; . . .art historians and artists use these               terms differently than do theologians or sociologists. In the present               context mysticism refers to the search for the state of oneness               with ultimate reality. Occultism depends upon secret, concealed               phenomena that are accessible only to those who have been appropriately               initiated. The occult is mysterious and is not readily available               to ordinary understanding or scientific reasoning.&#148; The occult               includes Pelton's general notions of cabalism, alchemy, and other               religious precepts and her use of specific colors, geometric shapes,               and other &#147;hidden meanings.&#148; For Pelton, the occult images               suggest life-giving forces, as well as cosmic and earthly elements               in her abstractions. Despite negative connotations of the occult               that may exist today, the symbolism Pelton employed resulted in               positive statements about the individual&#146;s power to create               and to search for knowledge and truth.<br>              <br>              4 AP letter to Mabel Dodge Luhan (hereafter referred to as MDL),               15 October 1929, MDL Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University,               YCAL, ZA Luhan, Correspondence Box P-Rem, Folder Agnes Pelton.<br>            </p>            <p>5 Pelton met Hamilton Easter Field when she studied at the British               Academy in Rome in 1911. He invited her to teach at his art school               in Ogunquit, Maine, during several subsequent summer sessions. Field               supported modernism and exhibited Pelton&#146;s work in Ogunquit               and at his Ardsley House Gallery in Brooklyn, New York. Field&#146;s               professional acquaintance with Walter Kuhn and Arthur B. Davies               was the impetus for Pelton&#146;s inclusion in the Armory Show.<br>            </p>            <p>6 AP Papers, AAA, roll 3426, frame 0549.<br>            </p>            <p>7 Agni Yoga developed first in Russia from writings and teachings               of Helena Roerich and her husband, artist Nicholas Roerich. When               the Roerichs visited the United States in the 1920s, the Agni Yoga               Society was established in New York City. <br>            </p>            <p>8 Helena Blavatsky's Key to Theosophy was the core of the Theosophical               movement in America during the first decades of the 1900s. Pelton               copied passages from this text into her journals in the 1920s. The               Theosophical Society had headquarters in New York and in Pasadena,               California, when Pelton became interested in its teachings. <br>            </p>            <p>9 This term implies one known to have extra-sensory perceptions.               Pelton recorded her dreams and imaginings in detail, often seeking               confirmation of actions from others, like Rudhyar and Jane Comfort.               In a letter to Comfort in 1930, Pelton described a vision she recently               experienced and asked Comfort to confirm it. She said, &#147; I&#146;m               asking this and writing in detail--because lately I&#146;ve seen               a number of things that have turned out correctly and I want to               know if is imagination or a faculty developing.&#148; AP letter               to Jane Levington Comfort (hereafter referred to as JLC), 26 February               1930, JLC Letters, AAA. Comfort discussed Pelton&#146;s special               gifts in a letter she wrote to mutual friend Mabel Dodge Luhan in               1943. She said that Pelton had warned the Comforts that the land               around their home was not conducive to her work. She said: &#147;Agnes               says force collects in the valleys all around and pours up over               the rounded tops of the hills and all over us and that it&#146;s               too exciting and too stimulating and she thinks it isn&#146;t good               for us.&#148; Comfort added: &#147;She is very fragile and very               potent--much more so than she knows anything about or would dream               of believing if you told her.&#148; JLC letter to MDL, 15 November               1943, Beinecke Library, Yale University, YCAL, ZA Luhan, Correspondence               Collier-Dd.<br>            </p>            <p>10 AP Papers, AAA, roll 3426, frame 0482.<br>            </p>            <p>11 L.W.

As he explained in The Glass               Hive in May 1927, the analogy is appropriate: &#147;The hive gives               us an intimation of the process--the clustering of bees together               for hours in a kind of heated silence--the wax forming in their               midst. In time each group will be such a center of contact between               the pattern and the production.&#148; Comfort believed the publication               would extend to &#147;various vortices of force throughout the country--small               dynamic groups already in the process of formation before our written               work is sent out.&#148; Comfort, The Glass Hive issue 2 (May 1927):               17.

Comfort are located at UCLA, Special Collections.               <br>            </p>            <p>13 Will Levington Comfort, Midstream: A Chronicle at Halfway (New               York: George H. Doran Company, 1914): 198-199. On another occasion,               Comfort stated that his &#147;love for the Bible today and for the               Sacred Writings of the Farther East, as well as the uncommon inner               tendency of my work as a modern American novelist are all directly               traceable to that first little book of Mrs. Besant&#146;s Thought-Power,               my greatest reading experience.&#148; Quoted in &#147;Will Levington               Comfort,&#148; Theosophical Year Book, 1937 on page 196. Information               provided by Lakshmi Narayan, Krotona Library, Ojai, California,               in letter to author, 11 April 2000.<br>            </p>            <p>14 Dane Rudyhar (1895-1985), born Daniel Chenneviere, was a musician,               author, astrologist, screenwriter, artist, entrepreneur, and philosopher.               Active in the avant-garde music-artistic circles of Paris in the               1920s, he moved to America and established himself in Hollywood               as a composer and screenwriter. Rudyhar chose his name, he claimed,               because it was derived from the Sanskrit root-word for red and referred               to the process of contradiction and resolution. It also represented               his birth sign under the red planet, Mars. <a href="http://shift.merriweb.com.au/Rudhyar/index.html">&lt;http://shift.merriweb.com.au/Rudhyar/index.html&gt;</a>.               Rudhyar supported Theosophical ideas, introduced Pelton to Agni               Yoga, and encouraged her in her varied philosophies. Rudyhar championed               Pelton&#146;s work, suggesting to Raymond Jonson that he include               her abstractions in his 1933 Fiesta Exhibition in Santa Fe. He also               furthered the cause of the Transcendental Painting Group. Rudyhar               and Pelton corresponded for many years, and he visited her in Cathedral               City with both of his wives, first Maya and then Leyla. Rudhyar               drew Pelton&#146;s astrological chart and questioned her in depth               about events in her life in letters in 1934. <br>            </p>            <p>15 In 1942, Pelton noted that Star Gazer was in Emma Newton&#146;s               possession. This is significant, as Newton appears to be the friend               who most encouraged Pelton to visit the Comfort compound and to               pursue the exploration of spirituality in her art in the 1920s.               Pelton and Newton (later Winchell) were friends for years. Newton               was a piano student of Florence Pelton and lived in New York City               before her move to California in the 1920s. Pelton completed her               portrait in 1921.

Taken in context, Comfort&#146;s text               divides the sexes, according to nineteenth-century separate spheres,               saying this &#147;gift&#148; is woman&#146;s power, her inspiration               to better the race of men. Every man, according to Comfort, should               revere motherhood as it is a &#147;vocation, illumination--that               white, irresistible flood of the spirit, the very vitality of God,               breaking through the consciousness of men, inspiring the utterance.               . .driving its fire ahead as far into the eternity of the future,               signalizing [sic] the man, a prophet, and the woman a mother of               the world.&#148;<br>            </p>            <p>19 Comfort, Midstream: 252.<br>            </p>            <p>20 Schroeder was a lawyer, active in the Free Speech League in               New York in the 1910s. He interpreted Freud&#146;s work and used               analysis to discredit religion and to shock his audiences. According               to biographers, Schroeder had a &#147;relentless need to talk about               the &#145;obscenity of religion.&#146;&#148; Heller and Rudnick,               1915: The Cultural Moment (News Brunswick: Rutgers University Press,               1991): 140-141.<br>            </p>            <p>21 Mary Austin (hereafter referred to as MA) letter to Theodore               Schroeder (hereafter referred to as TS), 10 March 1919, MA Papers,               Huntington Library, Box 60/AU 1235.<br>            </p>            <p>22 MA letter to TS, 23 January 1919, MA Papers, Huntington Library,               Box 60/AU 1216.<br>            </p>            <p>23 MA letter to TS, 22 May 1919, MA Papers, Box 60/AU 1221. Schroeder               was not easily convinced and continued to join the two--the erotic               with the spiritual experience. By 5 December 1919, Austin was infuriated               and wrote: &#147;You are the most persistently wrong-headed man               I ever met!&#148; MA Papers, Huntington Library, Box 60/AU1226.<br>            </p>            <p>24 The hook is an important symbol, as its interpretations range               from energy to craving. According to Besant and Leadbeater&#146;s               Thought-Forms (p. 34), &#147;curving hooks are signs of strong craving               for personal possession.&#148; Perhaps Pelton used &#147;an ugly               hook of darkness&#148; as the impetus to move away from the personal               and the physical toward the light of spiritual ecstasy.<br>            </p>            <p>25 &#147;Ecstasy,&#148; a poem by Agnes Pelton: &#147;A flower               bursts open/in rush of ecstasy to meet the Day/Before, unknown/Its               petals bent/So sudden its release/ Soft gray shapes that pressed/An               ugly hook of darkness,/The life force gathered/And swift and free/It               opened, to the light.&#148;<br>            </p>            <p>26 In The Key to Theosophy (pp. 6-7), ecstasy is defined as &#147;the               liberation of the mind from its finite consciousness, becoming one               and identified with the infinite.&#148; Enlightenment or ecstasy               (digambara) is the highest state reached in Hindu worship. The word               ecstasy comes from the Greek ekstasis which mean &#147;standing               forth naked.&#148; In Greece, as in ancient India, proper worship               was sometimes conducted in a state of physical nakedness to symbolize               purification from all distractions, to concentrate on the ecstatic               experience.

It               is no surprise, then, that the physical and the spiritual are often               viewed as one. <br>            </p>            <p>27 The colors, from bottom to top, are arranged according to the               body&#146;s colored chakras, moving upward from the pelvis to the               brain--red, orange, yellow, green blue, indigo, and violet-white.               Pelton was familiar with charkas and painted a work entitled Chakras               in 1937 after a visit to Ojai, California. Also, through her first               experiences in the 1910s and &#145;20s with Emma Curtis Hopkins               in New York, a well-known healing practitioner, to her mention of               the faith healer Avak who was in Palm Springs in 1947, Pelton continued               her interest in non-medicated healing throughout her life. <br>            </p>            <p>28 Pelton sketched Star Gazer on 19 February 1929.

Pelton&#146;s               own description of Star Gazer in 1957 said that it was &#147;an               abstraction painted on &#145;the hill&#146; years ago.&#148; At               that time, it was owned by her friend Emma Newton. As Pelton described               it: &#147;It was an after glow over the hills, with Venus close               in the darkening sky--with a cone shaped form reaching upward with               pale green chalice about it--holding the star light. It is of an               emotional nature.&#148; AP letter to JLC, 16 November 1957, JLC               Letters, AAA. <br>            </p>            <p>29 Clare Gibson, Signs and Symbols (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble,               1996): 91.<br>            </p>            <p>30 Trajectus sursum is a term developed by this author to express               the visual intent and design of Pelton&#146;s spiritual abstractions.               Trajectus means path and sursum, a movement upward. This phrase               references, too, the exhortation of sursum corda, &#147;lift up               your hearts,&#148; from the liturgies of the Christian Mass. A review               in the San Diego Union, December 31, 1933, confirms this sense of               motion in Pelton&#146;s abstractions. Reginald H. Poland, Director               of the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery commented: &#147;&#146;Fire Sounds&#146;               and &#145;Jade&#146; seem actually to move....and to carry us away               to a new region and one which is itself cut off from contact with               this mundane sphere.&#148; AP Papers, AAA, roll 3426, frame 0351.               In notes introducing Pelton&#146;s exhibition in Plainfield, New               Jersey in 1931, Rudhyar describes the images in her abstractions               with terms like &#147;upward rush&#148; and &#147;upward aspiration.&#148;               AP Papers, AAA, roll 3426, frame 0544. A review in the New York               Evening Post, 21 February 1931, noted that Agnes Pelton&#146;s designs               &#147;grow upward from the bottom of the canvas, spreading like               some delicate growth stretching to the light.&#148; AP Papers, clipping,               New York Evening Post, 21 February 1931, roll 3426, frame 0468.               Also, in a note to AP, JLC about the &#147;upward movement.&#148;               AP Papers, roll 3426, frame 0176.<br>            </p>            <p>31 Dane Rudhyar, &#147;Art of Gestures and Art of Patterns,&#148;               in Art as the Release of Power: A Series of Seven Essays on the               Philosophy of Art (Carmel, California: HAMSA Publications, 1930):               1-5. Rudhyar concludes his text with a summary of many of the ideas               he expressed in letters to Pelton over the years: that her work               is part of a divine plan. He said: &#147;Work, work. . .noble work,               sacrificial, sacramental work; right from the center of the Living               Self. . .a perpetual flow of Life, a rhythmical tone of being manifested               through heroic doing. . . .Work from which power radiates; power               assumed for the sake of the Whole. . .Work through which the Soul               can pour and sing and glow earthward. . . Work of Destiny. . .performed               &#145;for and as the Universal Self&#146; without attachment to               the fruits thereof. Such work is the basis and the test of true               spiritual Nobility; the requirement for entering the rank of the               Aristocracy of Spiritual Workers which is the Heart of the new Man.               It is the work of the Living Civilization.&#148; Rudhyar, &#147;The               New Individual and the Work of Civilization,&#148; in Art as the               Release of Power:24.
