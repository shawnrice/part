Pelton&#146;s self-declared &#147;life&#146;s         work&#148; was to create meaningful abstractions, her &#147;windows to         an inner realm,&#148; &#147;the exploration of places not yet visited.&#148;         Abstractions, for Pelton, were &#147;a new way of seeing.&#148;<sup>2</sup><br>        Meditation, receptivity, study, and divine inspiration created Pelton&#146;s         abstractions. She worked on individual paintings sporadically for months,         sometimes for years. Pelton&#146;s powerful drive to paint these inner         visions also developed over time and resulted from multiple causes. Pelton&#146;s         work in abstraction began during the first two decades of the 1900s when         she lived in New York City and continued throughout her life. She was         working on her final painting, Light Center (fig. 1), when she died in         1961, at her home in the desert community of Cathedral City, California.       </p>      <p><br>        In particular, subjects, symbols, and influences suggested by Pelton&#146;s         abstractions can be linked to aspects of her life. Entwined with the personal         and biographical is Pelton&#146;s immersion in the natural world, the         cosmos, mysticism, and the occult.<sup>3</sup> Further, the abstractions         express reflections about nature, sexuality, intellect, and creativity.         Even more, her works embody a developing spirituality and make clear her         life&#146;s purpose: to use abstractions to convey her &#147;light message         to the world.&#148;<sup>4</sup></p>      <p><br>        A student of Arthur Wesley Dow and Hamilton Easter Field,<sup>5</sup>         Pelton was already an accomplished painter of representative figures and         landscapes when she exhibited in the Armory Show in 1913. In the 1910s,         Pelton&#146;s imaginative paintings were similar in style to those of         Arthur B. Davies and featured wispy, young ing&eacute;nues surrounded         by natural landscapes. Even with her early work, Pelton explored abstract         concepts which she identified in titles, like Supremacy (1915), Power         (1916), Inward Joy (1915), Thought (1916, Peace (1922), and Vision (1915).<sup>6</sup>         Throughout her more than sixty professional years of painting, Pelton         continued to complete portraits, landscapes, and floral scenes to make         a living, but she dedicated her soul to abstraction.</p>      <p><br>        Abstraction became Pelton&#146;s visual representation of a spiritual         quest. She explored multiple ideologies as she developed her own iconography.         Because she believed the Presbyterian and fundamentalist beliefs of her         ancestors were both socially and personally flawed, Pelton investigated         and embraced the tenets of Agni Yoga,<sup>7</sup> Theosophy,<sup>8</sup>         other Eastern religions and New Age philosophies. Pelton was also a &#147;sensitive,&#148;<sup>9</sup>         believed in auras, made personal choices based on numerology, and explained         physical ailments through astrological chartings. Through the years, she         studied the teachings of Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater, Krishnamurti,         and Shambhala. In her abstractions, Pelton expressed a strong inner response         to life, including sexuality and creativity. Through her abstractions,         she explored the outer cosmos and her view of an inner world. </p>      <p><br>        Pelton outlined her purpose for painting in a journal entry entitled &#147;Knowledge.&#148;         She copied the following passage from an unidentified Theosophist: &#147;Spiritual         transactions must be translated into the language of mortal senses that         they be understood, so as to be of practical benefit to mortals who desire         to be redeemed from mortality.&#148; These words articulate Pelton&#146;s         design--to translate spiritual messages with her paintings. In brackets         on that page, she added her own comments: &#147;This is where the forms         of the natural world must appear in a picture, or can do so--not for themselves         but to convey thought as future light.&#148;<sup>10 </sup> Thus, light         is a both a symbol and a subject in Pelton&#146;s abstractions. It represents         enlightenment and ecstasy; it also suggests inspiration and the creative         force.</p>      <p><br>        The principles of Theosophy provided a spiritual grounding for Pelton.         In her journal, she often quoted Helena Blavatsky, but in another journal         entry, she referred to L. W. Rogers&#146; The Elementary Theosophy. In         particular, she noted Rogers&#146; reference to &#147;the ray,&#148; always         present in Theosophical teachings. Pelton copied: &#147;It [the ray] is         literally a spark of the divine fire. . .an emanation of God&#148; that         comes to earth and touches the soul.<sup>11</sup> Pelton gave form to         this passage in her abstraction, The Ray, 1931 (fig. 2). In this abstraction,         she connects the earthly world with the shaft of light slanted upward.         The flower, centered at the base of the column of light, symbolizes human         creativity; the light source directs the spirit&#146;s journey upward.       </p>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="128" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="214">        <tr>           <td height="206"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('shele_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=500')"><img src="shele_2.jpg" width="160" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td bgcolor="ffffff">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="josel_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               2:</b> The Ray<i>, </i></a>1931</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Pelton was drawn to Theosophy because it emphasized knowledge and good         work. It also afforded her a network of practitioners, if and when she         needed support or encouragement. Generally, Pelton worked alone in her         studio, without frequent contact with other artists. However, in 1928-29,         she associated with a spiritualist colony called the Glass Hive<sup>12</sup>         in Pasadena, California. Leaving her studio in New York City, Pelton planned         to visit her friend Emma Newton in Pasadena for an extended stay. Newton         introduced Pelton to Will Levington Comfort, the leader of the Glass Hive,         and both women became active with the Hive. <br>        Comfort claimed &#147;not to be a Theosophist, nor cultist of any kind,&#148;         yet his beliefs were based on a variety of works, some he named specifically,         including the Bible, Annie Besant&#146;s Thought-Power and Blavatsky&#146;s         Theosophical treatises. He also mentioned &#147;straight Hindu literature,&#148;         Alfred Pierce Signet&#146;s Esoteric Buddhism (1894), the Bhagavad Gila,         and the words of Swami Vivekananda.<sup>13</sup> Pelton, who had also         noted these works in her journal, shared a bond with the other artists         and writers associated with the Hive. Further, she embraced Comfort&#146;s         philosophy that meditation prepared the way for an inward journey toward         harmony, peace and purpose. During those months in Pasadena, Pelton&#146;s         creativity soared.</p>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="97" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="195">        <tr>           <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('shele_3.html','part','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="shele_3.jpg" width="167" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td bgcolor="ffffff">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="josel_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               3:</b> Ecstacy, 1928</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>The Glass Hive was more than an esoteric group of artists and writers         exchanging ideas. To Comfort, it was an important link to building a stronger,         more civilized world. Membership in the Hive fluctuated, as connections         to the group extended nationwide; individuals participated at various         levels, some only through the publications, others through association         with those who knew Comfort&#146;s books, letters, and periodicals. For         five years, 1927-32, Comfort edited a small journal, The Glass Hive, which         stated the group&#146;s philosophy and made clear its connection to the         Aquarian Foundation. Articles in The Glass Hive covered subjects ranging         from astrology to the principles of Agni Yoga, to the cosmos, to communism,         to current issues like the &#147;marriage&#148; question, to the creative         process, in general, and the production of art, in particular. Although         contributors were usually identified only by initials, some named individuals         included Dane Rudhyar,<sup>14</sup> whose book Seed Ideas--Art as a Release         of Power was praised, artist Mabel Alvarez, D.H. Lawrence, Dorothy Brett,         Mahatma Gandhi, artist Beatrice Wood, and artist Thomas Tyrone Comfort,         to name a few. </p>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="97" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('shele_4.html','part','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="shele_4.jpg" width="105" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td bgcolor="ffffff">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="josel_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               4:</b> Star Gazer, 1929</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Association with the Glass Hive extended Pelton&#146;s circle of acquaintances.         During that 1928-1929 trip to Pasadena, for example, Pelton developed         a lasting friendship with Comfort&#146;s daughter Jane. They exchanged         letters for more than twenty-five years, and discussed topics such as         creativity, astronomy, spirituality, meditation, landscape, painting,         writing, health, family, and friendship. While part of the Hive in 1929,         Pelton painted and first exhibited Jane&#146;s striking portrait and created         Incarnation, an abstraction she dedicated to Jane Comfort. Moreover, during         her stay in Pasadena Pelton exhibited Ecstasy, 1928 (fig. 3), and did         sketches for Star Gazer, 1929 (fig. 4).<sup>15</sup> </p>      <p><br>      </p>      <p>The environment around the Hive encouraged individual, creative activity.         Pelton not only focused on the spiritual quest, but she also explored         the physical world. She may have done sketches for one of her first desert         landscapes, California Landscape Near Pasadena, dated 1930. At nearby         Huntington Botanical Gardens, she filled her sketchbook with detailed         drawings of flower heads and stems. Based on her dated sketches, the Huntington         Gardens were the probable inspiration for her painting, Lotus for Lida,         1929 (fig. 5), which can be considered one of the earliest abstractions         painted in California. </p>      <p><br>        While in Pasadena, Pelton exhibited abstractions, floral works, landscapes,         and portraits at the Grace Nicholson Art Galleries in Pasadena and a select         group of abstractions at Jake Zeitlin Books in Los Angeles. All her activity         attracted notice. Reviewers in the Los Angeles Herald called her paintings         &#147;abstractions externalized on canvas&#148; and touted them as &#147;program         music of the imagination.&#148;<sup>16</sup> Pelton was pleased with the         public reception of her abstractions in Los Angeles and enthusiastically         planned an exhibition in New York City at the Montross Gallery for the         following November. A letter to her friend Mabel Dodge Luhan in Taos,         in October 1929, confirmed her expectations: </p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          I am about to start on for me--a real adventure, an exhibition of my           &#147;Abstractions&#148; at the Montross Gallery. . . .If you think           of any of your friends whom you think would be interested, I would appreciate           it if you would send their names for a catalogue. These pictures are,           I am sure, my especial [sic] light message to the world. They created           considerable interest in California, so I decided it was now or never           in New York, and I want to get those people who might be interested           in them and what they stand for to come and see them. . . .<sup>17</sup>         </p>      </blockquote>      <p><br>        Abstractions were Pelton&#146;s quest for peace in body, mind, and spirit.         Her works exude a timelessness, a journey toward ecstasy in the natural         world or in space beyond.<br>        It is the multivalent concepts of the term &#147;ecstasy&#148; which lead         to the personal in Pelton&#146;s abstractions. Connotations of ecstasy         reach toward physical pleasure, religious understanding, intellectual         enlightenment, and spiritual transcendence. When she painted her flowering         abstraction Ecstasy in 1928 (fig. 3), Pelton entered a cultural debate         about the meaning of the abstract concept of ecstasy. Other artists of         the time, too, explored ecstasy as a subject in abstraction, including         her friend and peer, Raymond Jonson. </p>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="18" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="94">        <tr>           <td><img src="shele_5.jpg" width="74" height="144" alt="Lotus for Lida"></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td bgcolor="ffffff" height="14">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="josel_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               5:</b> Lotus for Lida, 1929</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Based in the writing and thinking of the time, there is no question that         the term ecstasy implied both a sexual and a spiritual release. For example,         Will Comfort and Mary Austin were two writers, known by Pelton, who discussed         ecstasy in detail. Comfort, for instance, described the exquisite moment         of physical ecstasy in his biography, Midstream, which Pelton read soon         after its publication in 1914. Comfort said, &#147;The words from the         lips of a woman in the ecstasy of love are mystical, vibrant from the         very source of things. . . .The man who is not hushed in the presence         of it, is not sensitive to divine presence. . . .She is a love-instrument         played upon by creative light.&#148;<sup>18</sup> Comfort mixed the physical         with the divine, but he also linked ecstasy to the creative process when         he stated, &#147;There is an ecstasy in the first view of one&#146;s unborn         realizations.&#148;<sup>19</sup> </p>      <p><br>        Austin expressed her views about religious and sexual ecstasy while she         was living in New Mexico in 1919. That year, Pelton spent time with Austin         in Taos as part of Mabel Dodge Luhan&#146;s circle. The women undoubtedly         exchanged views on ecstasy, as it was a topic Austin heatedly debated         in a series of letters written in 1919 to Theodore Schroeder<sup>20</sup>         of the School of American Research in Santa Fe. In those letters, Austin         appeared to share the same ideas that Comfort had espoused when she said,         &#147;Sex always stirs the part of women which is closest in touch with         the Law of Life. Sex is the prelude to the great experience of continuity         of life, so that there is nothing abnormal, nothing that requires a special         explanation in the close association of sex experience and religious experience.&#148;         She added, &#147;Love and religion are like two strings on a musical instrument.         You cannot pluck strongly at one without raising overtones in the other.&#148;<sup>21</sup>         Austin disagreed with Schroeder&#146;s insistence that religion was a         debased and perverted sex experience. For Austin, sex and religion were         separate entities, she said, but she did allow that for other women, religion         often became the outlet for sexual energy.<sup>22</sup> However, in another         letter, Austin described the ecstatic states she experienced as intellectual,         and religious, noting that the &#147;result of a subconscious perception         of truth&#148; has a &#147;pale glow of exactly the same thing that accompanies         religious ecstasy.&#148;<sup>23</sup> Often, the intellectual, sexual,         religious, and emotional references to ecstasy are merged.</p>      <p><br>        Perhaps it is also the multiple connotations of ecstasy and release that         make Pelton&#146;s Ecstasy, 1928 (fig.3) so intriguing. Not only does         this abstraction represent a natural object, a flower, which has sexual         connotations of alluring beauty and reproductive forces of its own, but         the abstraction also contains occult references with its &#147;dark hook&#148;         of energetic craving,<sup>24</sup> its blossoming release, and its resultant         opening to the light of the sun. In the poem<sup>25</sup> Pelton composed         to accompany this abstraction, she alludes to the multiple meanings of         ecstasy. Physical growth, emotional release, and intellectual aspiration         or enlightenment are mixed with the religious suggestion of ascension         to a higher joy.<sup>26</sup> Clearly, Pelton uses the multiple meanings         of &#147;ecstasy&#148; to bind the material and physical world to the         spiritual.</p>      <p><br>      </p>      <p>It is in her abstraction, Star Gazer, 1929 (fig. 4), that the combination         of the physical and spiritual worlds merge most graphically. Primary colors         and a upward, visual trajectory toward the star dominate in this abstraction.         The bottom third of the painting contains earth-like images in reds and         yellows; the remaining portion consists of a sky in deepening shades of         cobalt blue, with one bright, six-pointed orb. At first glance, the most         prominent image is a pale green vase on a pedestal of maroons and pink,         centered at the bottom of the canvas, surrounded by a rolling mass of         hills of dark black-brown, reds, and pale orange. Contained within the         vase is a scaled projectile-shaped object, pointed upward. A yellow glow         covers the horizon and lights the lower portion of the sky. Pelton&#146;s         arrangement of colors, befitting of landscape, earth and sky, has additional         occult significance that appeals, perhaps, on the intuitive level to viewers         who are aware of the body&#146;s color-coded chakras.<sup>27</sup> </p>      <p><br>        In Star Gazer, Pelton abstracts both the human figure and the plant to         create a sense of growth, a new beginning, another dawn.<sup>28</sup>         This abstraction projects multiple images of creativity. Primarily, the         central object is a plant sprouting from the soil, growing toward the         light. However, the projectile within the vase might represent the sexual         act, perhaps a referent to a penis penetrating a womb. The landscape would         then become a body and the united act aimed toward the star, a dual image         of ecstasy, physical and spiritual. In a similar mixture of images, the         star shining in the sky could be the North Star, the traveler&#146;s compass,         or the Star of Bethlehem. It might signify an idea, a heavenly blessing,         or a divine presence. Or, it could simply refer to Venus, the morning         star, as Pelton noted in her journal. As the eye of the night, it could         signify spiritual enlightenment and wisdom, as well as human aspiration.<sup>29</sup>         Star Gazer becomes more complex when the sexual interpretation moves through         other levels. In this abstraction, there is a creative spirit, a sprouting         plant, a growth within the universal womb, above the plane of the earth.         In Star Gazer, the physical and spiritual ecstasy blend as the destination         is the star, a guiding light. </p>      <p><br>        Pelton&#146;s compulsion to paint abstractions that conveyed her spiritual         aspiration evolved in the 1920s and continued until her death. A selected         series of her paintings illumine patterns of images she developed. Examining         the religious underpinnings in these examples establish Pelton&#146;s         abstractions as personal statements with a universal purpose--to bring         light to life. In these abstractions with a spiritual motif, Pelton created         on canvas an upward movement through space. This sense of trajectus sursum<sup>30</sup>         is spiritual and physical, earthly and cosmic, real and hopeful. It is         the visible reflection of her inner goal, the sharing of which became         her purpose. Taken as a series, the abstractions--Star Gazer, The Guide,         Illumination, Alchemy, Awakening, Voyaging, and Light Center--illumine         the soul&#146;s journey as seen through Pelton&#146;s painted symbols.       </p>      <p><br>        As an overall statement of Pelton&#146;s spiritual vision, these abstractions         illumine a structured progression, regardless of their chronological completion.         Like pieces of the puzzle assembled in different moments of reflection,         meditation, and inspiration, these abstractions are Pelton&#146;s vision         of immortality given painted form.</p>      <p> <br>        In Pelton&#146;s design for the spiritual journey, a questioning exists,         at first, a longing for explanation, a gesture toward the heavens, a need         for response. Star Gazer represents that possibility. Then, mentors, philosophies,         and opportunities are provided to spark the individual&#146;s desire to         know. At this point in the quest, the individual looks to The Guide for         direction, discovering that the true source of power, light, and awareness         might exist within the mind. Suddenly, the spiritual quest, which was         once a vague, unformed longing, becomes a way of life, as evidenced in         Illumination. A mystical change occurs as the material of the body and         physical world becomes the spiritual in Alchemy. With this, the soul has         a rebirth, an Awakening, and begins its final, upward journey. In Voyaging         the golden bell rings, a signal that an individual&#146;s life on earth         has prepared the way of the future. In Light Center, the ultimate realization         is simple: the true center of radiance comes from within. What matters         is allowing the spirit to glow outwardly through its human form, sharing         the light with others. In these abstractions and others, Pelton offers         a visual mapping of the path toward enlightenment and spiritual ecstasy.       </p>      <p><br>        About her last painting, Light Center, (fig. 1) Pelton said, &#147;Life         is really all light, you know.&#148; In this abstraction, from its intensely         luminous center disk, a white oval radiates outward through the wavy,         lighted &#147;aura&#148; to its hazy, glowing edges. The top of the oval         brushes the cloud forms above as it hovers, suspended in mid-air, over         the earth-tone masses below. A powerful shaft of light cuts through the         blue sky background, covering the middle, vertical third of the canvas.         This connecting ray of light illuminates the cloud edges, encompasses         the white oval, and disappears into the ground below. Faint purple plumes,         like hands, seem to provide a floating resting space for the central oval         of light. This painting does not have a separate star. The light source         is the oval and the circle within. </p>      <p><br>        Pelton&#146;s concept in this abstraction parallels a passage from Dane         Rudhyar&#146;s Art as a Release of Power in his series entitled Seed Ideas.         Rudyhar believed every &#147;organized entity. . .has a life-center, the         heart and soul of the entity. To this center comes impressions from the         outer world. . .from this center radiate impulses which cause various         types of motion, affecting in some ways the outer world surrounding the         boundaries of the organism.&#148; In other words, Rudhyar&#146;s entity         is the center of all impulses, incoming and outgoing, &#147;an evolving         self,&#148; the &#147;All Form, the one Universal Self&#148; which exists         in the &#147;Eternal Now.&#148; At this ultimate point, time and space         do not exist, and the individual Light Center becomes part of the Universal         Soul.<sup>31</sup> </p>      <p><br>        By replacing the external guiding light, or star, with a white flame or         radiance emerging from a light source within the self, Pelton confirmed         the individual&#146;s powerful role--to bring light to life. Obviously,         in Pelton&#146;s view, &#147;seeing the light&#148; was her spiritual         goal, the sunlight her inspiration, a star her guiding light, and enlightenment--or         spiritual ecstasy--became her work in the world.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="10">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
