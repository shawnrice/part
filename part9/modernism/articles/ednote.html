The thematic nature               of each installment of Part offers exciting possibilities for focused               scholarly events. It lends itself to an issue dedicated to what               remains the most incompletely understood and under-appreciated aspect               of American art up to World War II, that is the era bracketed on               one side by the American Impressionists and on the other by the               Abstract Expressionists. The advent of modernism in American painting               and sculpture is a complex event, as anyone who has taught American               art has experienced when trying to explain its sudden rise to an               audience of non-major undergraduates. The limited venues for publishing               articles, the increased difficulties with publishing due to printing               costs and copyright issues, and the increased competition for publishing               opportunities, made it highly desirable to publish an issue of PART               that would be all about early-twentieth century American art.</p>            <p> The reasons for producing an issue of PART focused on early-modernist               American art are numerous. This is an area full of undiscovered,               ignored, and dismissed artists and artworks just ready to be reconsidered               and further studied. The early years of modern art in America have               been eclipsed by the interest of scholars and collectors in American               art of the nineteenth century and the era after World War II. The               Hudson River School, Mary Cassatt, John Singer Sargent, James W.               M. Whistler, Georgia O'Keeffe, Pop Art, Andy Warhol and Jackson               Pollock are relatively familiar. Synchromism, the Transcendental               Painting Group, Arthur Dove, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Stuart Davis,               and Agnes Pelton are not nearly as well-known, and are even obscure               by comparison. In many cases, these artists have clearly not been               given their due. Arthur Dove started creating abstract paintings               right around the time Kandinsky made the leap to total abstraction;               he made an equivalent transformation only months later and, depending               on how strictly you define &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;total&quot;               abstraction, that period of time may be a little longer or even               shorter. Yet Dove is marginalized in surveys of abstract art because               of geographic dislocation. He was not only an American; he was working               in America at the time that abstraction was born. Consequently,               his reputation has suffered. Although survey books of modern art               will group abstract artists from France to the Soviet Union in one               chapter, they will usually relegate Dove, Marsden Hartley, Macdonald-Wright,               Joseph Stella, O'Keeffe, and Stuart Davis to a separate chapter               on American modern art. Similarly, the significance of Synchromism,               perhaps the first movement in modern art started by American artists,               has also been marginalized. Its connections to Orphism, particularly               the light-color abstraction of Robert Delaunay, have been debated               often yet remain confused and misunderstood. This seems even stranger               than the situation with Dove because Macdonald-Wright, Morgan Russell,               and Patrick Henry Bruce spent much of their early careers in Paris,               and were in Paris when cubism and abstraction were the latest developments               in French avant-garde art.</p>            <p> The articles and reviews in PART 9: American Modernism reflect               the vitality of this field in recent years. Most of the articles               bring long overdue attention to deserving modernists who came from               or lived in America for most or all of their careers, but have received               little scholarly attention until the past ten or fifteen years.               The rest of the articles offer new and different perspectives on               artists who are better known. Ruth Pasquine's article on Emil Bisttram               and Nancy Sheley's article on Agnes Pelton are groundbreaking studies               of two neglected modernists who spent most of their lives outside               of the Northeast, where modern art dominated in galleries, museums,               and social circles, but where, it turns out, it did not flourish               exclusively. Their rich, articulate studies demonstrate the continuously               evolving ways that abstract art, whatever its national or regional               origin, may be analyzed and interpreted. Their scholarship also               reveals that the sources, influences, intentions, and expressive               possibilities of abstract art are more diverse, complex, and nuanced               than has traditionally been thought. Dr. Pasquine's article on Bisttram               reveals how mathematical logic and precision could be applied to               abstract painting and drawing, and it is the most current and thorough               study of how the aesthetic theory of Dynamic Symmetry, as espoused               by Jay Hambidge in the 1920s, could be put to supremely effective               use. Dr. Sheley's article on Pelton explores the intersection of               biography and alternative spirituality in the early-twentieth century.               We often hear of the impact of Theosophy and its founders Helena               Blavatsky and Rudolph Steiner, and their significance is indisputable,               but they are part of a huge matrix of alternatives to centuries-old               belief systems that evolved in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth               centuries and gave rise to abstraction. Dr. Vrachopoulos' article               on Jean Xceron expands our understanding of the stylistic sources               and influences that shaped one of the relatively better-known abstractionists               in America during the Great Depression and World War II. &quot;Better-known&quot;               is very relative in this case, and must be stressed. Xceron spent               most of his career in New York and socialized with many of the leading               artists of the era, be they Americans or European expatriates who               fled Nazi rampage and censorship during World War II. His abstract               art was very much a product of this milieu, but as Dr. Vrachopoulos               demonstrates so meticulously in her article, his work was still               a very fresh, vital, and personal creation. My article on Stuart               Davis is not intended to &quot;resurrect&quot; an overlooked artist,               because of all the American artists featured in Part 9: American               Modernism, he is the best known. Instead, my article is an attempt               to broaden the perspective through which Davis has usually been               understood. Although formalist studies of Davis are numerous and               thorough, the social, political, and cultural context of Davis'               Cubist-influenced exploration of mass-media imagery and the look               of everyday commodities has not been adequately studied. My article               is an attempt to correct this situation. The book reviews in this               issue of Part represent the proliferation of scholarly studies in               the field over the past few years. They indicate that more varied               methodologies and theories are being applied to this still young               and developing area in American art history. Brian Hack's review               of two recent survey books on American art is thought-provoking               commentary on the problems with teaching introductory survey courses               and writing books for them.</p>            <p> PART 9: American Modernism is dedicated to Professors Emeritae               Marlene Park and Diane Kelder, two members of the faculty of the               CUNY Graduate Center who recently retired: Prof. Park and Prof.               Kelder have each participated in the Ph.D. Program in Art History               for more than twenty years, having started their tenure in CUNY               at two of its senior colleges, John Jay College of Criminal Justice               and the College of Staten Island. When they joined the Ph.D. Program               in Art History in 1980, they became part of a rapidly growing, thriving               doctoral program that is now distinguished for its scholarship of               American art.</p>            <p>               Prof. Park trained as a Medievalist at Columbia University under               the                tutelage of Meyer Shapiro. Following a pattern similar to Prof.               Shapiro,               who began his scholarly career as a Medieval but is remembered today               for his                important work in modern art, she soon began groundbreaking scholarship               of                American art of the early-twentieth century. At the Graduate Center,               she                taught courses on American art of the 1930s, American modernism               between the                World Wars, American women sculptors, and public art in the United               States.                She will be remembered for her study of public art and government-sponsored                              art from the era of the Great Depression and the New Deal. She and               John               Jay College colleague Gerald Markowitz co-authored New Deal for               Art: The                Government Art Projects of the 1930s with Examples from New York               City and                State in 1977 and Democratic Vistas: Post Offices and Public Art               of the New                Deal in 1984. This research evolved in unison with her interest               in                photographing the public art she has researched. Prof. Park has               always               taken great pleasure in contributing to scholarly projects that               originated with               her doctoral students, which is testimony to her modesty as a scholar               and the                regard for her among her students. She has contributed to exhibitions               and                publications that were coordinated by Graduate Center alumni Ilene               Fort,               Will South, Diane Linden, and Alejandro Anreus, to name just a few.               Her courses                broadened the horizons of countless students. It was in her class               on                American art of the 1930s that my interest in Raymond Jonson was               rekindled               (I had briefly read about him a couple of years earlier), and that               interest,                which Prof. Park wholeheartedly encouraged, led to my dissertation               on the               New Mexico abstract painter. Prof. Park's enthusiastic introduction               to                lesser-known artists in her various courses was also important to               Ruth                Pasquine's study of Bisttram and the scholarship of countless graduate                              students. Prof. Park also authored an important study of depictions               of                lynching in American graphic arts of the 1930s, an updated version               of which                will soon be published. Prof. Park remains active as a scholar from               her               home in sunny California, to which she moved when she retired a               few years ago.                Her essay on Blanche Lazzell is due to be published next year.               Prof. Kelder received her B.A. from Queens College, my alma mater               I am                proud to say, and went on to receive her doctorate at Bryn Mawr.               Her                scholarly interests are also highly eclectic, as is revealed by               the variety                of the courses she taught and the articles and books she has published.               At                the Graduate Center, she taught courses on history painting in France               during the era of Jacques-Louis David and the history of printmaking               during the                modern era. Although her dissertation was on late-eighteenth century               French history painting, she has published extensively on later               European and                American art. Her best-known books are probably the gorgeously illustrated                              The Great Book of Impressionism and The Great Book of Post-Impressionism.                              However, some of her most important work has been in early-twentieth               century American art, particularly on Stuart Davis. Her anthology               of Davis'               writing is an important resource in the study of the artist; it               was essential to my                article on him in this issue of Part. She also contributed to the               catalogue of the 1993 retrospective of Davis' work, which remains               the most complete               and authoritative study of the artist. She recently curated the               exhibition                Stuart Davis: Art and Theory, 1920-31 at the Pierpont Morgan Library               and                wrote the essay and entries for its catalogue. Prof. Kelder has               remained                very active at the Graduate Center since her retirement from teaching               a few                years ago. She has become the founding director of the Art Gallery               of the                CUNY Graduate Center. Under her guidance, the Graduate Center has                              established a genuine, dynamic, thriving exhibition space, and to               date it               has hosted numerous exhibits that are impressive in their diversity,               scope, and                quality. Considering her tireless activities for the new gallery,               one               might wonder if she ever really retired at all.               This issue of Part was inspired by these scholars and teachers,               by the                research they have conducted, the courses they taught, the methodology               they                imparted to their students, the wisdom they have shared, and the               guidance                they have given so generously. For all they did and continue to               do, we                wholeheartedly thank them and present this issue to an interested               and                enthusiastic audience in their honor.</p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Herbert R.
