The existing scholarship on Davis,           being mostly formalist criticism, hardly says. Davis has entered the           canon of American modernism because of his talent for pictorial composition           and mastery of European modernist styles which he brilliantly &#8220;Americanized.&#8221;           This basis for his canonical status fails to account for Davis&#8217;           exploration through painting and drawing of modern American life as           manifest in everyday household objects and the mass-produced imagery           of advertising, package design, and the media. It is possible, by utilizing           twentieth-century cultural theory, to discern Davis&#8217; attitude           toward the commodity capitalism that fueled enormous prosperity in the           United States during Davis&#8217; lifetime and which appear often in           his oeuvre.</p>        <p align="left"> Davis was able to think of painting in terms of formal           and non-formal content simultaneously, a fact which the mostly formalist           approaches to him has obscured. In his 1935 essay &#8220;Abstract Painting           in America,&#8221; Davis wrote that a painting is &#8220;a two-dimensional           plane surface and the process of making a painting is the act of defining           two-dimensional space on that surface.&#8221;[1] He was very concerned           with visually satisfying and engaging forms, colors, and compositions,           but he never distanced his art from non-formal expression; quite to           the contrary, he wholeheartedly embraced psychological, social, and           ideological content in his art. Davis became an artist under the influence           of Robert Henri and the Ash Can School, and the sociological perspective           of this modern urban realism stayed with him his entire life. In the           1930s, Davis was active in Marxist politics&#8211;he read Marx, Lenin,           and related political thinkers&#8211;and was a supporter of the poor           and the working classes in their struggle to improve their lives during           the Great Depression.[2]</p>        <p align="left"> Davis considered art to have a vital role in society,           as he explained in great detail in his 1940 essay &#8220;Abstract Painting           Today&#8221;: &#8220;The sociological theorist says that art is a social           expression and changes as society changes, and so it does...[The sociological           theory of art] conceives [of] art as a social function changed and molded           by the social forces in its environment merely in a passive way... This           viewpoint fails to see that the work of art itself changes the emotions           and ideas of people.&#8221;[3] He wrote in &#8220;Abstract Art in the           American Scene&#8221; that &#8220;modern art has not changed the social           function of art but has kept it alive by using as its subject matter           the new and interesting relationships of form and color which are everywhere           apparent in our environment.&#8221;[4] Davis believed art could change           people&#8217;s lives, that it could affect the emotions and thinking           of people, that it reflected social changes but could also produce them.</p>        <p align="left"> Davis believed modern art in general, and of course his           art in particular, was inextricably related in style and subject to           modern life, particularly to the tangible manifestations of modernity           such as the wide variety of industrially mass-produced commodities that           transformed everyday life and made possible many new experiences&#8211;lights,           sounds, spaces, and speeds&#8211;that were all quintessentially modern           and American. Davis discussed the closeness between modern art and modern           life often in his essays. His thoughts are close in spirit, more than           in style, to the ideas on modern technology and how it should manifest           itself in modern art espoused by the Cubist Fernand L&eacute;ger and           the Futurists. Davis wrote in &#8220;The Cube Root&#8221; that &#8220;modern           pictures deal with contemporary subject matter in terms of art. The           artist does not exercise his freedom in a non-material world. Science           has created a new environment, in which new forms, lights, speeds and           spaces, are a reality.&#8221;[5] In &#8220;Is There a Revolution in           the Arts?&#8221; he wrote that &#8220;we [modern artists] prefer the           modern works because they are closer to our daily experience. They were           painted by men who lived, and who still live, in the revolutionary lights,           speeds, and spaces of today, which science and art have made possible.&#8221;[6]           L&eacute;ger and the Futurists were excited by the advances in technology           and industry that they had witnessed or anticipated in the early twentieth           century.[7] They believed everyday life would be easier and more enjoyable           because these technological developments would filter into industry,           commerce, and private life. The exalting attitude toward modern technology           of the Futurists is clearly declared in &#8220;The Manifesto of the           Futurist Painters,&#8221; a joint effort of 1910 by Umberto Boccioni,           Carlo Carra, Luigi Russolo, Giacomo Balla and Giacomo Severini, when           they wrote:</p>        <blockquote>           <p align="left"> We tell you now that the triumphant progress of science             makes profound changes in humanity inevitable...we are confident in             the radiant splendour of our future... Living art draws its life from             the surrounding environment...we must breathe in the tangible miracles             of contemporary art&#8211;the iron network of speedy communications             which envelop the earth, the transatlantic liners...those marvelous             flights which furrow our skies... How can we remain insensible to             the frenetic life of our great cities and to the exciting new psychology             of night life...[8] </p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">Davis offered an explanation of the relationship between           modern art and modern technology in &#8220;Is There a Revolution in           the Arts?&#8221; that essentially summarizes the ideas of L&eacute;ger           and the Futurists in declaring that modern art is largely an impassioned           response to everyday life and that the relationship between modern art           and life is so fluid that the two are inseparable. He wrote that:</p>        <blockquote>           <p align="left"> an artist who has traveled on a steam train, driven             an automobile, or flown in an airplane doesn&#8217;t feel the same             way about form and space as one who has not. An artist who has used             a telegraph, telephone, and radio doesn&#8217;t feel the same way             about time and space as one who has not. And an artist who lives in             a world of the motion picture, electricity, and synthetic chemistry             doesn&#8217;t feel the same way about light and color as one who has             not. An artist who has lived in a democratic society has a different             view of what a human being really is than one who has not. These new             experiences, emotions, and ideas are reflected in modern art...[9]</p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">In &#8220;The Cube Root&#8221; Davis enumerated some of           the tangible, visible aspects of everyday modern life which have inspired           his own work:</p>        <blockquote>           <p align="left"> Some of the things which have made me want to paint,             outside of art, are: American wood and iron work of the past; Civil             War and skyscraper architecture; the brilliant colors on gasoline             stations; chain-store fronts; and taxi-cabs; the music of Bach; synthetic             chemistry; the poetry of Rimbeau; fast travel by train, auto, and             aeroplane [sic] which brought new and multiple perspectives; electric             signs, the landscape and boats of Gloucester, Massachusetts; five             and ten cent store kitchen utensils; movies and radio; Earl Hines             hot piano and negro jazz music in general, etc. In one way or another,             the quality of these things plays a role in determining the character             of my paintings. Not in the sense of describing them in graphic images,             but by predetermining an analogous dynamics in the design, which becomes             a new part of the American environment...just Color-Space Compositions             [sic] celebrating the resolution of stresses set up by some aspects             of the American scene.[10] </p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left">In &#8220;Modernism and Mass Culture in the Visual Arts,&#8221;           his groundbreaking essay of 1981, Thomas Crow writes that avant-garde           art has repeatedly been inspired, influenced, and renewed by mass culture           and everyday life. Crow reminds us of the many instances in which modern           art borrows certain visual forms or aspects of content from mass culture,           sometimes in very profound ways and other times in very subtle ways,           beginning in Cubist collages and continuing through Dada and Constructivism,           even affecting such purist abstraction as the late work of Mondrian,           and becoming the central element in Pop and much postmodern art. Crow           thinks the issue of quality remains the exclusive domain of high art,           an opinion Davis might have held, but he believes that modern &#8220;high&#8221;           art is greatly influenced and conditioned by mass culture, that mass           culture is &#8220;prior and determining, modernism is its effect&#8221;           in that &#8220;mass culture has determined the form high culture must           assume.&#8221;[11] It is in perceiving mass culture as the source and           inspiration for avant-garde, modern art that Crow and Davis so obviously           agree. Davis&#8217; closeness to Crow&#8217;s thinking is clearly indicated           in his enumeration of his inspirations outside of art in &#8220;The           Cube Root.&#8221; Davis does not seem to have been preoccupied with           distinctions between high and low in art, although he was surely aware           of them.</p>        <p align="left"> Davis was not totally uncritical of mass culture and           capitalism. In &#8220;What About Modern Art and Democracy?,&#8221; Davis           criticized capitalism for its tendency to manipulate the public in its           search for huge profits. In this article, Davis wrote that capitalists           use their wealth and influence to glorify the representational art that           depicts distinctly American subjects (the people, landscapes, and buildings           of the United States) in ways which emphasize their American identity           and values in order to exploit a reactionary, provincial perspective           of life that serves their hunger for profits. He placed some of the           blame for this exploitation on the public itself, which he considers           eager for advances in industrial commodities but in favor of old-fashioned           values in art and culture. Davis wrote:</p>        <blockquote>           <p align="left"> Business puts its weight behind glorifying an art,             supposedly founded on sound American traditions, which exploits the             American scene in terms of traditional and provincial ideology...The             familiar, the literal, or the &#8220;folksy&#8221; is reiterated to             the exclusion of new vision and new synthesis. The public...seems             to want its artists&#8217; vision in traditional forms. Creative bathrooms             and kitchens are eagerly desired, and we are told that it will soon             be possible to bring home the dehydrated soup from the A &amp; P in             a helicopter; but in cultural matters, nostalgia for the old frontiers             tends to dim out the new frontiers already in view...Business approves             of art, yes, but an art of the status quo to soothe the public mind             and keep it on the beam...[12] </p>        </blockquote>        <p align="left"><em>Lucky Strike</em> of 1921 [Plate 1] features an array           of fragmented motifs abstracted from the packaging for that cigarette           brand which have been juxtaposed in bold, contrasting patterns. This           painting captures the effect of abrupt opposition and deformation found           in Cubist collage, but does so artificially, since it is entirely done           in oil. The arrangement of forms loosely simulates what a cigarette           package would look like if dismantled and flattened.[13] Davis seems           to be using Cubism to analyze the visual logic and psychological effects           of commercial packaging. <em>Lucky Strike</em> engages Crow&#8217;s           claim that mass culture and art are on parallel paths in the search           for greater understanding of life, except that the relationship between           mass culture and art in Davis&#8217; painting is not parallel: mass           culture is drawn into art in the search for understanding. Davis&#8217;           works should not be taken as slavish, uncritical acceptance or celebration           of mass-media imagery and industrially-produced goods, as they often           are. In fact, skepticism may be imbued in many of Davis&#8217; works.           Perhaps the abrupt, confusing arrangement of fragmented forms refers           to the artificiality and deception of clever package design and advertising,           which is directed at consumers and is intended to lure them into desiring           and then purchasing an item.</p>        <table width="122" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">          <tr>             <td class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('harte_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=750')"><img src="harte_2.jpg" width="180" height="336" border="0"></a></td>          </tr>          <tr valign="top">             <td> <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                 2:</b> Davis, <em>Visa</em>, 1951, oil on canvas, 40 x 52&quot;,                 Museum of Modern Art, New York</span></div></td>          </tr>        </table>        <p align="left">Davis admitted in his essay on his 1951 painting <em>Visa</em>           [Plate 2] that the painting was inspired by an advertisement in a matchbook           cover which he found boring and hoped to make interesting in his series           of paintings based on it. As with his paintings of commercial products           from the 1920s, <em>Visa</em> and the other &#8220;Champion&#8221; paintings           were initiated by contact with mass culture. He said his use of the           word &#8220;else,&#8221; as in &#8220;something else&#8221; or &#8220;somewhere           else,&#8221; indicated his belief that all subject matter was equivalent,           but that even though certain words would automatically convey specific           meanings, he chose to avoid conveying them, being more concerned with           formal issues.[14] However, considering the continuity of Davis&#8217;           theories, it is difficult to believe that &#8220;else&#8221; is without           any meanings other than purely formal effects. Instead, the vagueness           of &#8220;else&#8221; may refer to the monotony and simplicity of mass-media           imagery, that one image inspired by mass-media imagery but then reconceptualized           by the modern artist is nothing more or less than something &#8220;else.&#8221;           Thus, <em>Visa</em> and the other &#8220;Champion&#8221; paintings may           be a comment on the mundane, redundant, banal quality of much mass-media           imagery.</p>        <p align="left"> <em>Visa</em> has the qualities of heavy-handed and superficial           excitement and pleasure, of easy and fleeting experience, and intellectual           banality for which mass culture has been derided by many leading critics           and theorists of modern art and culture, including Clement Greenberg           in &#8220;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&#8221; and Max Horkheimer and Theodor           Adorno in &#8220;Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.&#8221; It           achieves what Davis called &#8220;analogous dynamics,&#8221; a quality           he sought in his art in order to give form to his response to mass culture.           The repetition of the basic composition in several paintings, each one           differing mostly in its color scheme, alludes to the redundancy of mass           culture about which many theorists have been quite vociferous. This           redundancy undermines the qualities of originality, authenticity, and           singularity associated with works of art, qualities Walter Benjamin           described as the &#8220;aura&#8221; of the work of art. Benjamin saw           the aura of the work of art diminished by photography, film, and advances           in printing, which proliferated during the twentieth century. In the           &#8220;Champion&#8221; series, the aura of the work of art is diminished           not by mechanical methods of visualization and reproduction, but by           the artist&#8217;s repetition of the composition. If <em>Visa</em> has           the &#8220;analogous dynamics&#8221; of mass culture, what if anything           separates it and its sister paintings from mass culture itself? What           makes it &#8220;art?&#8221; Davis&#8217; announced intention to make           the found advertisement more interesting has involved stripping the           advertisement of its ease of comprehension, thereby making it less effective           in communicating commodity identity, utility, and attractiveness. What           makes this &#8220;high&#8221; art is the opposite of what made it effective           commercial packaging and popular culture.</p>        <div align="left"> </div>        <div class=Section6 align="left"> </div></td>      <td>&nbsp; </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
