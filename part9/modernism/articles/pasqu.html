His knowledge of the subject was enhanced by his relationships               with some of the most prominent Theosophists of the time, including               Claude Bragdon (1866-1947), Nicholas Roerich (1874-1947), and Manly               P. Hall (1901-1990).<sup>1</sup> At the same time he became interested               in Dynamic Symmetry, a system of picture composition based on Euclidean               geometry, developed by Jay Hambidge (1867-1924). Intrigued by the               Theosophical axiom that religion and geometry are integrally related,               Bisttram developed an approach to painting--which he fully explained               in his teaching curricula--that brought the two systems together.               When Bisttram settled in Taos, New Mexico, in 1931, he found a receptive               audience for his ideas on Theosophy and spirituality, but a mixed               reaction to Dynamic Symmetry.<sup>2</sup></p>            <p><br>              In 1938, when he proposed the idea of founding what would become               the Transcendental Painting Group (TPG) to his three students, Horace               Pierce (1914-58), Florence Miller (b. 1918), and Robert Gribbroeck               (1906-1971), spirituality was central to his concept. Bisttram brought               in the Santa Fe painter and architect William Lumpkins (1910-2000),               who then proposed the idea in Santa Fe.<sup>3</sup> Bisttram's               good friend Raymond Jonson (1891-1982) became the most active member;               his primary contribution was expanding and solidifying the membership,               bringing in the Canadian painter Lawren Harris (1885-1970), the               California painter Agnes Pelton (1881-1961), the New Mexico painter               Stuart Walker (1904-1940), and Dane Rudhyar (1895-1985) and Alfred               Morang (1901-1958) as writers to publicize the TPG. Harris, Pelton,               and Rudhyar were all avowed Theosophists.<sup>4</sup> </p>            <p><br>              Harris was a well-heeled Canadian painter whom Jonson met in Santa               Fe in March 1938, while Harris and his wife were traveling cross-country.               Bisttram and Harris struck up a close friendship at this time, and               Harris took a number of classes on Dynamic Symmetry with Bisttram.               Bisttram had studied with Hambidge in New York in the early 1920s,               and Harris, who like Hambidge was Canadian, was already familiar               with Dynamic Symmetry. Bisttram's spiritual interpretation and application               of Hambidge's system must have been a strong factor in their friendship,               especially since Harris acquired Bisttram's drawing <i>Time Cycle               No. 1</i>, n.d. (Fig. 1), one of Bisttram's more complex uses of               the system.<sup>4</sup> While the circumstances under which Harris               acquired this drawing are not exactly known, the spiritual dimensions               of the drawing serve as an example of the type of work that the               TPG members were interested in. </p>            <p><br>              This drawing uses primary geometric forms--circles, equilateral               triangles, squares, and cubes-to express the creative-destructive               forces within the universe, and to depict relationships between               time and space as well as between life and death. Bisttram provides               the following interpretation for this drawing: </p>            <blockquote>               <p><br>                <i>Time Cycle No. 1</i> is also one of a series resulting from                 meditations on time and space. In this particular drawing the                 lines of force or energy permeating space, manifesting out of                 one source, having passed through the various organizing centers,                 take on the geometric shapes of our world before matter condenses                 or crystallizes on them. At the same time the drawing has the                 suggestion of a pendulum in the shape of a scythe, a reaper swinging                 in eternal space.<sup>6</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p><br>              The creative aspect of the forms is expressed by the descending               series of circles, triangles, and squares. This series follows Theosophical               theory, which postulates that creation is a geometrical progression,               beginning with a point. H. P. Blavatsky (1831-91), the most important               exponent of Theosophy in modern times, expressed this idea by citing               Pythagorean theory, one of the foundations of her approach:</p>            <blockquote>               <p><br>                In the Pythagorean Theogony the hierarchies of the heavenly Host                 and Gods were numbered and expressed numerically. Pythagoras had                 studied Esoteric Science in India; therefore we find his pupils                 saying &quot;the monad (the manifested one) is the principle of                 all things. From the Monad and the indeterminate Duad (Chaos),                 numbers; from numbers, Points; from points, Lines; from lines,                 Superficies; from superficies, Solids; from these, solid Bodies,                 whose elements are four: Fire, Water, Air, Earth; all of which                 transmuted (correlated) and totally changed, this world consists.&quot;--(Diogenes                 Laerius in Vit. Pythag.)<sup>7</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p> <br>              Bisttram's involvement with Theosophy and Dynamic Symmetry               led him to his interest in Kandinsky's use of geometric form,               since it seemed to him that Kandinsky's book <i>Point and Line               to Plane</i> (1926) echoed this basic Theosophical tenet. By utilizing               a scythe in his image, Bisttram also expresses the idea that death               is the complement of creation, and that the two working together               alternately define the cyclic nature of time. A source for the symbolism               of the scythe is found in Max Heindel's The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception               (1909), a book which Bisttram studied closely.<sup>8</sup> Max Heindel               (1865-1919), founder of the Rosicrucian Society in Oceanside, California,               commented on the scythe as follows:</p>            <blockquote>               <p><br>                This is the law that is symbolized in the scythe of the reaper,                 Death; the law that says, &quot;whatsoever a man soweth, that                 shall he also reap.&quot; It is the law of cause and effect, which                 rules all things in the three Worlds, in every realm of nature-physical,                 moral and mental. Everywhere it works inexorably, adjusting all                 things, restoring the equilibrium wherever even the slightest                 action has brought about a disturbance, as all action must...                 The law we are now considering is called the law of Consequence.<sup>9</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p><br>              Heindel is referring here to the law of karma. Heindel connects               the scythe with the concept of reincarnation by referring to it               as a symbol of the harvest of the permanent atom or Seed-Atom that               occurs at the time of death. This atom becomes the basis for the               individual in his next life: </p>            <blockquote>               <p><br>                So man builds and sows until the moment of death arrives. Then                 the seed-time and the periods of growth and ripening are past.                 The harvest time has come, when the skeleton spectre of Death                 arrives with his scythe and hour-glass. That is a good symbol.                 The skeleton symbolizes the relatively permanent part of the body.                 The scythe represents the fact that this permanent part, which                 is about to be harvested by the spirit, is the fruitage of the                 life now drawing to a close. The hour-glass in his hand indicates                 that the hour does not strike until the full course has been run                 in harmony with unvarying laws. When that moment arrives a separation                 of the vehicles takes place. As his life in the Physical World                 is ended for the time being, it is not necessary for man to retain                 his dense body. The vital body, which, as we have explained, also                 belongs to the Physical World, is withdrawn by way of the head,                 leaving the dense body inanimate. The higher vehicles--vital body,                 desire body and mind--are seen to leave the dense body with a                 spiral movement, taking with them the soul of one dense atom.                 Not the atom itself, but the forces that played through it. The                 results of the experiences passed through in the dense body during                 the life just ended have been impressed upon this particular atom.                 While all the other atoms of the dense body have been renewed                 from time to time, this permanent atom has remained. It has remained                 stable, not only through one life, but it has been a part of every                 dense body ever used by a particular Ego. It is withdrawn at death                 only to reawaken at the dawn of another physical life, to serve                 again as the nucleus around which is built the new dense body                 to be used by the same Ego. It is therefore called the &quot;Seed-Atom.&quot;<sup>10</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p><br>              While this quote suggests that there is only one Seed-Atom harvested               at the end of a life, later in the text Heindel explains that there               are a number of Seed-Atoms; one, in fact, for each of an individual's               vehicles. What I am suggesting, then, is that the bright spots in               the centers of the major forms of Bisttram's composition depict               these Seed-Atoms that are about to be harvested by the scythe at               the end of a life. The ne in the center of the cube and the one               in the center of the triangle are specifically marked with &quot;tails&quot;               of seven lines each. Also, there seems to be a type of Seed-Atom               in the center of the circular form that marks the handle of the               scythe.</p>            <p><br>              This interpretation leads more provocatively, however, to the conclusion               that Bisttram's series of geometrical forms is meant to represent               an individual. This is confirmed in Theosophical theory which conceives               of man as a sevenfold being, diagramed as a triangle supported by               a square. Blatvasky, indeed, diagrams man in just this way. She               labels the upper three parts as: 1. Universal Spirit (Atma); 2.               Spiritual Soul (Buddhi); 3. Human Soul, Mind (Manas); and the lower               four as: 4. Animal Soul (Kama-Rupa); 5. Astral Body (Linga Sarira);               6. Life Essence (Prana); 7. Body (Sthula Sarira).<sup>11</sup></p>            <p><br>              Bisttram's use and placement of the triangle and square and               the presence of seven tails on the Seed-Atoms within the triangle               and square would seem then to refer to Blavatsky's concept               of man. Additionally, the moving scythe seems like it is about to               bring the square into alignment underneath the triangle. This seems               to refer to the concept of geometrical alignment articulated by               the Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880-1949) in her book Letters on               Occult Meditation (1922): </p>            <blockquote>               <p><br>                The aim of the evolution of man in the three worlds--the physical,                 emotional and mental planes--is the alignment of his threefold                 Personality with the body egoic, till the one straight line is                 achieved and the man becomes the One.Each life that the Personality                 leads is, at the close, represented by some geometrical figure,                 some utilisation of the lines of the cube, and their demonstration                 in a form of some kind... The Master is He Who has blended all                 the lines of fivefold development first into the three, and then                 into the one. The six-pointed star becomes the five-pointed star,                 the cube becomes the triangle, and the triangle becomes the one;                 whilst the one (at the end of the greater cycle) becomes the point                 in the circle of manifestation.<sup>12</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <table width="54" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_2.jpg" width="149" height="237" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="41">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> This chart is                     labeled on the top The Seven Planes of Our Solar System and                     on the bottom The Constitution of Man</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>In the same book she also discusses Seed-Atoms or permanent atoms,               and provides a chart showing their location (Fig. 2). This chart               is labeled at the top The Seven Planes of Our Solar System and at               the bottom The Constitution of Man.<sup>13</sup> The titles refer               to the Theosophical concept of man as a microcosm of the cosmic               macrocosm. In this diagram she draws a triangle connecting the atmic,               buddhic, and mental permanent atoms. The three angles of the triangle               are 40, 110, and 30 degrees respectively. Measuring the triangle               formed by the three permanent atoms in Bisttram's drawing,               we find angles of 30, 120, and 30 degrees, essentially Bailey's               triangle reversed right to left. </p>            <p><br>              According to Bailey, an individual operates, or is &quot;polarised,&quot;               by different permanent atoms at different periods of his life; when               an individual operates at the level of the three higher permanent               atoms, he is &quot;a Master of the Wisdom.&quot;<sup>14</sup> I               suggest that in Time Cycle I, Bisttram is depicting man as the microcosm               of the cosmic macrocosm, as well as man at his most evolved--operating               at the highest possible level at the time of his passing.</p>            <p><br>              Another indication that Bisttram was studying Bailey can be seen               in his use of color, when he later executed this drawing in oils               (Fig. 3). In this same book, Bailey includes a section on color               that gives a list of &quot;the seven streams of colour by which               manifestation becomes possible&quot;: 1. Blue, 2. Indigo, 3. Green,               4. Yellow, 5. Orange, 6. Red, 7. Violet. Bisttram used this color               sequence for both of the seven-rayed tails of the permanent atoms.               It is an unusual sequence because the expected order would be that               of the spectrum, with purple on one end and red on the other. Also,               Bailey associates blue, the dominant color of Bisttram's painting,               with the perfected man and the auric envelope through which he manifests,               as well as with the auric egg and the Solar Logos.<sup>15</sup></p>            <p><br>            </p>            <table width="87" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="237">              <tr>                 <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_3.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_3.jpg" width="190" height="214" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="41">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Another indication                     that Bisttram was studying Bailey can be seen in his use of                     color, when he later executed this drawing in oils </div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>Bisttram's treatment of the square as a cube within a cube               also relates to Claude Bragdon's theory of the fourth dimension.               Bisttram knew Bragdon in New York, and used his books as texts in               his classes in Taos. Bragdon, following Blavatsky, used the circle,               equilateral triangle, and square as the units of creation, explaining               that &quot;the circle is the symbol of the universe; the equilateral               triangle, of the higher trinity (atma, buddhi, manas); and the square,               of the lower quaternary of man's sevenfold nature.&quot;<sup>16</sup></p>            <p><br>              Bragdon based his theory of the fourth dimension on the problem               of transforming the square into the cube as a diagram of the process               of redemption. For Bragdon, the upper portion of a cube is heaven               (the fourth dimension) and the lower portion is the world as we               know it. Man the microcosm is the cube in his ideal (archetypal)               form; as man descends into incarnation from the upper part of the               cube to the lower part, he becomes a square. When descending into               incarnation, the square is distorted by the angle by which it enters,               producing the distortions of the individual personality (Fig. 4).<sup>17</sup>               The goal of the individual is to square up his life and to eventually               become the cube. Bragdon diagrams the fourth dimension as a cube               within a cube a metaphor for man the square rolling himself up,               as it were, back into a cube within the larger universal cube.<sup>18</sup>               Bragdon takes this idea from Blavatsky:</p>            <blockquote>              <p><br>                As those Alchemists have it: -- &quot;When the Three and the Four                 kiss each other, the Quaternary joins its middle nature with that                 of the triangle,&quot; (or Triad, i.e., the face of one of its                 plane surfaces becoming the middle face of the other), &quot;and                 becomes a cube; then only does it (the cube unfolded) become the                 vehicle and the number of Life, the Father-Mother seven.&quot;<sup>19</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p><br>            </p>            <table width="87" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_4.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_4.jpg" width="147" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4</b></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>By using Bragdon's symbol of the cube within the cube, Bisttram               injects the idea of the fourth dimension into his drawing. Additionally,               by connecting the series of squares with the center of one of the               circles, Bisttram describes life as a cycle that emanates from and               then returns to the Godhead.</p>            <p><br>              As in all of his works, Bisttram used Hambidge's system of               Dynamic Symmetry in the organization of this drawing. His general               approach was to first do a freehand sketch of his idea, and then               afterwards bring the design into geometrical proportion using Dynamic               Symmetry. He began this process by establishing the major diagonal,               which in this case is the handle of the scythe (Fig. 5, line AB).<sup>20</sup>              He then constructed the rectangle (ABCD) around this diagonal. In               this case he then drew another rectangle of the same size (ADEF)               next to it. </p>            <p><br>              The next operation is to divide the rectangles into what Hambidge               called reciprocals, that is, smaller rectangles that are proportional               to the whole. This is done by drawing a diagonal line perpendicular               to the major diagonal, and then drawing in the horizontal. This               procedure is repeated until the rectangle is divided into a series               of rectangles that are proportional to the whole. Each rectangle               can be divided into smaller units, and verticals can be drawn through               intersecting points without sacrificing proportionality.</p>            <p><br>            </p>            <table width="144" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td>                   <div align="center"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_5.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_5.jpg" width="180" height="220" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></div>                </td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 5 </b></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>Since photographs are inaccurate, and I am working at a smaller               scale, my lines are undoubtedly inaccurate. What is accurate, however,               is the perpendicular relationship between the base lines of the               triangles and the major diagonal. Indeed, this process of coordinating               verticals and horizontals with diagonals using geometric proportion               is the means and aim of Dynamic Symmetry. The principal tension               in the drawing is between the primary diagonal of the handle of               the scythe and the horizontals and verticals of the cube and squares.               The relationship between the two is mediated and resolved by the               triangles, whose bases, following the rules of Dynamic Symmetry,               are perpendicular to the primary diagonal.</p>            <p><br>              Hambidge's method sets up proportional areas in rectangles               following the laws of Euclidean geometry. In his system he constructs               specific rectangles that relate to each other geometrically (including               the golden section), and recommends these be used by artists to               bring their compositions into proportion.<sup>21</sup> In this case Bisttram               did not use one of Hambidge's specified rectangles--he made               up his own because he wanted a very steep angle. In fact the angle               of the diagonal is about 15 degrees. The shape in which he set the               design, however, is one of the shapes that Hambidge recommended--two               side-by-side vertically oriented root-five rectangles. The root-five               rectangle (2.236+) is more than twice as long as it is wide, and               is longer and narrower, for example, than the golden section rectangle               (1.618+), whose length is a little more than one-and-a-half times               its width. </p>            <p><br>              It is instructive to think about Bisttram's drawing with the               central vertical axis drawn in, showing the two vertical side-by-side               root-five rectangles.<sup>22</sup> This shows that Bisttram oriented               his design on the page so that the central vertical axis would bisect               the small circle at the top, and form the left edge of the cube,               adding yet another layer of meaning to the image. Bisttram may have               selected the root-five format, as he did in other works, because               of its cosmic dimensions. The diagonal of the root-five rectangle               makes an angle of 23.5 degrees, the angle of the inclination of               the earth's axis to the pole of the ecliptic. Bisttram, following               Hambidge and Plato, defined beauty as &quot;a matter of functional               coordination.&quot; </p>            <p><br>              Bisttram's drawing is executed in pencil with an exacting technique               of very small dots, utilizing negative space that leaves the lines               of the drawing white. He executed some 25 drawings in this style               in the late 1930s. I argue in my dissertation that although Bisttram               studied Kandinsky's Point and Line to Plane in the late 1920s               when he was developing his Three-Year Course, a course which he               taught with some variations during the entirety of his teaching               career, he did not become acquainted with Kandinsky's geometrical               abstractions until he saw them reproduced in the Guggenheim catalogues               that were published beginning in 1936. While many of Bisttram's               &quot;transcendental&quot; works are influenced by the works in               these catalogues, I propose that the works belonging to this series               were done independently of visual influence from Kandinsky, and               represent an original aesthetic expression.</p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="pasqu_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="pasqu_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>            </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Ruth Pasquine<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
