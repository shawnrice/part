Framing America: A Social History of         American Art. New York: Thames and Hudson, 2002<br>        <br>        Bjelajac, David. American Art: A Cultural History. Upper Saddle (NJ):         Prentice Hall, 2000.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        In history&#146;s dead and drought-dry fields the gleaners of meaning         gather and weave their strands into deceptively palatable truths. Our         understanding of time&#151;perhaps itself a delusion of convenience&#151;abets         our innate penchant for narrative as we drape the objects of the world         beneath a concealing curtain of words. History requires a faith more fervent         than any religious ideology; to believe in the past may, in a sense, be         both a defining characteristic and a fundamental sensory error of the         human animal. To avoid the alternative&#151;a faith in the perpetual now,         the eternal moment defined not by time but by change&#151;we create a         sense of the past, a web of connections which places people, events and         objects into fathomable contexts. <br>        Paradoxically, contextualization both blinds and reveals; although examining         artworks through political, social, philosophical, scientific, and art         historical lenses offers comforting insights otherwise invisible, it is         arguable (and has been argued) that there are meanings beyond the scope         of contextual analysis. Not that meaning is purely a relative social construction;         I would argue rather that the truly important meanings are often beyond         the limits of immediate cognition or, at the very least, beyond the academic         process of time/space contextualization.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        We arrange the objects of the world into patterns of influence. Imagine         a billion card tables&#151;each piled high with past and present jigsaw         puzzle pieces. From these tables we choose a select few pieces from which         to construct stories, often force-fitting incongruous puzzle pieces into         tidy narratives. Inevitably, puzzles could be assembled with pieces that         fit perfectly, although the finished image would be undecipherable. Seldom         would, and seldom do, the pieces and the resultant image match perfectly.         Every so often pieces are exchanged to accommodate current sensibilities;         these rejected objects and the ideas that accompany them then are thrown         back onto the pile, orphaned from the narrative until a later moment when         perhaps they will reappear as lost or overlooked or understudied but nevertheless         crucial to the understanding of the present. If we could glimpse even         momentarily the predicament that confronts us&#151;the sheer volume of         the puzzle pieces and the humbling awareness that the tenuous connections         that connect them may be illusory at best&#151;our self-assigned task         of making sense of images would not be the smugly elite refuge it may         appear to some outside the field.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        As art historians, our mission is just this: to examine the objects made         by those in a time and space (presumably) different from the present moment         and to assign them possible meanings based on contextualization. These         interpretations or narratives are then taught to others through texts         and lectures&#151;more often than not through that most honored of educational         treatises, the survey textbook. It is through such texts that the need         for grand-scheme, large picture narrative is most apparent: survey texts         provide the outline; additional courses and texts fill in the corollaries.         Needless to say, surveys are necessary simplifications&#151;abridgements         of events too numerous to comprehend. One would be hard-pressed, however,         to consider an alternative that provides the scope and conciseness of         a survey, as their practicality makes up for their deficiencies.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Assigning a survey text is assigning a belief in the narrative structure.         While many in the postmodern mode of thought readily admit there are countless         narratives&#151;those of previously ignored groups in particular&#151;it         is less frequently admitted that our very notion of the narrative is perhaps         not only inadequate but also erroneous. Some surveys attempt to atone         by offering a thematic but chronological approach, realizing that neither         is singularly adequate to understanding the meanings of a work of art.         The purely thematic approach lacks chronology; the chronological, social         contextualization. What is needed is an entirely new manner of viewing         objects that is not stymied by the illusory constraints of context or         chronology. Is such a vision possible? Is it advisable? Is it practical?</p>      <p class="second"><br>        American Art instructors have no doubt wrestled with such issues when         deciding which survey text is best for classroom instruction. Wayne Craven&#146;s         American Art: History and Culture has been a time-honored text, although         some instructors may feel less than compelled to follow its rigid divisions         by medium and period. Its strength is that its reliance on the facts allows         for the application of a myriad of methodologies. In recent years several         textbooks have emerged that offer more contextual approaches: Frances         K. Pohl&#146;s Framing America: A Social History of American Art and David         Bjelajac&#146;s American Art: A Cultural History.<br>        Pohl&#146;s survey&#151;a mighty tome that will no doubt unravel the seams         of bookbags and young spines nationwide&#151;reveals both the soaring         heights and dreary depths of postmodern thought. Far from a chronological         run-through of canonical expectations, Framing America examines American         art and artifacts through thematic divisions (such as Art and Conquest;         Nature and Nation; and Work and Art) that explore art&#146;s relation         to the social attitudes of its historical moment. The result is an often-refreshing         selection of artworks, such as Emanuel Leutze&#146;s The Storming of the         Teocalli by Cortez and His Troops (1848), Albert Weinert&#146;s Haymarket         Monument (1893), and Jos&eacute; Clemente Orozco&#146;s Prometheus (1930).         Although this is a welcome attempt to expand the definition and cultural         boundaries of American art to include Native American, African American,         and Latin American artists, it could be argued that a wider vision of         &#147;Art of the Americas&#148; is necessary to attain a more accurate         portrayal and understanding.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        As one might expect, much is made of the fact that American attitudes         of the past are less than flattering (Framing America becomes an obvious         double-entendre&#151;whether or not America is unjustly framed in the         textbook remains an issue of personal opinion). Images such as Harriet         Cany Peale&#146;s Her Mistress&#146;s Clothes (1848) and an 1860 advertisement         for baking powder that features an eager-to-please &#147;mammy&#148; seem         included merely as reflections of racist attitudes. While it is refreshing         to see such uncommon images in survey texts, one occasionally senses that         the theme at hand takes precedence over the works themselves. <br>        We find ourselves at an interesting junction: Connoisseurship, no longer         a primary concern for the art historian (for better or worse), has given         way to an unprecedented freedom: all images are worthy of examination         regardless of aesthetic quality, provided they help us better contextualize         and create meaning. In theory this seems a plausible starting point. Material         and popular culture are, without question, important avenues of exploration.         Is it more important for students to study a racist ad or a navy recruitment         poster, however, than, say, even one work by Thomas Sully, William Rush,         Alexander Jackson Davis, Sanford Gifford, Horatio Greenough, Erastus Dow         Palmer, John Quincy Adams Ward, Clark Mills, Henry Kirke Brown, William         Wetmore Story, Randolph Rogers, William Rimmer, H.H. Richardson, William         Morris Hunt, Elihu Vedder, or Albert Pinkham Ryder (to name just a few         of the unmentioned artists)?</p>      <p class="second"><br>        One could argue that Framing America strives to divert us from the narrative         of these canonical figures by offering different pathways. It is a useful         textbook in this regard, if one is interested in teaching social history         without imposing a canon of well-known American artworks (Is it really         important for students to be aware of Sargent&#146;s Madame X or Allston&#146;s         Belshazzar&#146;s Feast?). Paintings typically relegated to the kitsch         category&#151;early twentieth century paintings of Native Americans, for         example&#151;are given ample attention (Some of these paintings are quite         interesting, although some well-known artists that helped create a mythic         conception of the West and Native Americans, such as George de Forest         Brush, are not included).<br>        It must be said, however, that the works that are included are discussed         in a clear and yet thorough manner&#151;Pohl assembles current art historical         interpretations on each work, diligently and admirably noting the ideas         of particular scholars. This approach of giving credit where credit is         due within the text itself is a welcome sight in a survey textbook, where         traditionally the author assumes the mantle of all-encompassing authority.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        One problem of a thematic approach, however, is that it tends to pigeonhole         certain artists and artworks. Henry Ossawa Tanner, for instance, is offered         not as an important proponent of Orientalism or as a realist in the Eakins         tradition but as a &#147;Precursor to the Harlem Renaissance&#148; (no         doubt true, but it is only one way of looking at Tanner&#146;s work).         An equally relevant art historical move would be to place Tanner in the         tradition of Delacroix or, perhaps more accurately, the influential Spanish         painter Mariano Fortuny. Similarly, Lilly Martin Spencer&#146;s works         are seen less as important genre paintings than as indications of the         male dominated society that defines women as domestic toilers. The dilemma         for postmodern textbook authors is how to both define and separate previously         marginalized groups by the hardships they faced (racism, sexism) while         inserting them into the ever-growing, ever-changing canon. [On a personal         note, I have always believed that for students, the &#147;canon&#148;         consists mainly of those works that are taught&#151;these are the works         that art history students will see as the core images they will then teach         to others. The canon is perpetually created and then repeated. Perhaps         this is the lesson of textbooks such as Framing America. In the end, though,         the very idea of a canon exists only in our heads.]</p>      <p class="second"><br>        There are some aspects of American art little explored in Framing America:         Little is mentioned of neoclassical expatriate sculptors and sculpture,         aside from the obligatory nod to Hiram Powers&#146;s The Greek Slave and         the work of Harriet Hosmer (represented by two works) and Edmonia Lewis         (represented by three works). Augustus Saint-Gaudens receives a single         mention with The Shaw Memorial, included primarily for its status as a         &#147;monument to freedom.&#148; Hosmer and Lewis are important for a         number of reasons, but there needs to be a more even-handedness when deciding         who to slight and who to champion.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        For those who want to push the study of artworks beyond notions of gender,         race, and colonization, Framing America may prove a frustrating account.         But it is by no means an uninteresting one&#151;on the contrary, Pohl         provides a great many insights by raising these issues, and offers serious         students of American Art a substantial art historical foundation, despite         the obvious omission of several key artworks. For those works that are         covered, Pohl has deftly relayed the contemporary thought on their potential         meanings without asserting those meanings as truth. Pohl&#146;s methodology         suggests that interpretations are always in flux, offering both past and         contemporary viewpoints.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Yet it is this diligence to modern interpretation that makes such texts         difficult to use in the classroom if those particular issues are not shared         interests of the professor. When every artwork under scrutiny is seen         only as an emblem of colonialism and conquest, it is difficult to explore         other issues and influences without creating a discrepancy between what         is being taught and what is being read.<br>        A more manageable effort is David Bjelajac&#146;s American Art: A Cultural         History. Smaller in size, American Art nevertheless covers critical social         issues without compromising canonical figures and artworks. Bjelajac similarly         divides the historical narrative into cultural themes&#151;for example,         The Invention and Mapping of America, Religious Rituals, National Identity,         and Gilded Age Commerce&#151;without circumscribing the social attitudes         of the past around each artwork. Admittedly, very few of the artists mentioned         above as having been omitted from Framing America are to be found in Bjelajac&#146;s         American Art. Although this may represent a changing notion of the canon,         it is understandable that a relatively in-depth survey devoted to social         history can only deal with a limited number of works.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Nevertheless, American Art: A Cultural History makes an admirable effort         to blend social commentary with canonical artworks, while offering discussions         of such uncommon choices as Jeremiah Pearson Hardy&#146;s Catherine Wheeler         Hardy and Her Daughter (1842) and Thomas Satterwhite Noble&#146;s The         Price of Blood (1868). Although less heavy-handed with his sense of social         injustice, Bjelajac addresses a wide variety of postmodern concerns through         inclusion of works such as Horatio Greenough&#146;s much-maligned The         Rescue (1837-53) and Edmonia Lewis&#146;s Forever Free (1867). What is         remarkable is that Bjelajac has both embraced and opened the canon by         presenting traditionally examined artworks along with those by artists         such as John Valentine Haidt, Margaret Foley and Elaine de Kooning.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        An unusual but fascinating element of American Art is Bjelajac&#146;s         interest in Freemasonry, a theme that meanders throughout the text. With         the prevalence of Masonic symbolism in American decorative arts (chairs,         Masonic aprons, tankards and membership certificates), it is without question         that freemasonry played a significant role in the development of American         intellectual and artistic life (Paul Revere, Benjamin Franklin, De Witt         Clinton, painter Ezra Ames, artist and author William Dunlap, architect         Robert Mills, and sculptors Gutzon Borglum and Charles Keck were among         the many artists and thinkers who were dedicated freemasons). Bjelajac         gives Masonic influence the attention it deserves in an American art survey         text without overstating its importance.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        Both texts are welcome additions to the table, as the direction such texts         are taking&#151;social context over formal or aesthetic considerations&#151;can         only assist the pedagogical process. Ultimately there is no perfect textbook,         and it is fortunate that few of us expect textbooks to present every artist         and every artwork that will be shown and discussed in class. It remains         our task to assemble the puzzle pieces of canonical American art, those         tenuous filaments of meaning that conveniently dwell within.</p>      <p align="left" class="second">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
