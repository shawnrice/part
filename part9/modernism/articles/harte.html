[The sociological                 theory of art] conceives [of] art as a social function changed                 and molded by the social forces in its environment merely in a                 passive way.... .&nbsp; This viewpoint fails to see that the work                 of art itself changes the emotions and ideas of people.<sup>3</sup></p>              <span class="second">He wrote in <i>Abstract Art in the American               Scene</i> that modern art has not changed the social function of               art but has kept it alive by using as its subject matter the new               and interesting relationships of form and color which are everywhere               apparent in our environment."<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Davis believed art               could change people's lives, that it could affect the emotions and               thinking of people, that it reflected social changes but could also               produce them.Davis believed modern art in general, and of course               his art in particular, was inextricably related in style and subject               to modern life, particularly in the tangible manifestations of modernity               such as the wide variety of industrially mass-produced commodities               that transformed everyday life and made possible many new experienceslights,               sounds, spaces, and speedsthat were all quintessentially modern               and American.&nbsp; Davis discussed the closeness between modern               art and modern life often in his essays.&nbsp; His thoughts are               close in spirit, more than in style, to the ideas on modern technology               and how it should manifest itself in modern art espoused by the               Cubist Fernand Leger and the Futurists.&nbsp; Davis wrote in "The               Cube Root" that &quot;modern pictures deal with contemporary subject               matter in terms of art.&nbsp; The artist does not exercise his freedom               in a non-material world.&nbsp; Science has created a new environment,               in which new forms, lights, speeds and spaces, are a reality.&quot;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;               In <i>Is There a Revolution in the Arts</i> he wrote that &quot;we               [modern artists] prefer the modern works because they are closer               to our daily experience. They were painted by men who lived, and               who still live, in the revolutionary lights, speeds, and spaces               of today, which science and art have made possible.&quot;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;               Leger and the Futurists were excited by the advances in technology               and industry that they had witnessed or anticipated in the early               twentieth century.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; They believed everyday life               would be easier and more enjoyable because these technological developments               would filter into industry, commerce, and private life.&nbsp; The               exalting attitude toward modern technology of the Futurists is clearly               declared in &quot;The Manifesto of the Futurist Painters," a joint               effort of 1910 by Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carra, Luigi Russolo,               Giacomo Balla and Giacomo Severini, when they wrote: </span></div>            <blockquote>               <div class=Section2 align="left"><span class="second">We tell you                 now that the triumphant progress of science makes profound changes                 in humanity inevitable....we are confident in the radiant splendour                 of our future.... .&nbsp;

              Crow reminds us of the many instances in which modern art borrows               certain visual forms or aspects of content from mass culture, sometimes               in very profound ways and other times in very subtle ways, beginning               in Cubist collages and continuing through Dada and Constructivism,               even affecting such purist abstraction as the late work of Mondrian,               and becoming the central element in Pop and much postmodern art.&nbsp;               Crow thinks the issue of quality remains the exclusive domain of               high art, an opinion Davis might have held, but he believes that               modern (high) art is greatly influenced and conditioned by mass               culture, that mass culture is "prior and determining, modernism               is its effect" in that "mass culture has determined the form high               culture must assume."<sup>11</sup>It is in perceiving mass culture               as the source and inspiration for avant-garde, modern art that Crow               and Davis so obviously agree.&nbsp; Davis' closeness to Crow's thinking               is clearly indicated in his enumeration of his inspirations outside               of art in "The Cube Root." Davis does not seem to have been preoccupied               with distinctions between high and low in art, although he was surely               aware of them.Davis was not totally uncritical of mass culture and               capitalism.&nbsp; In &quot;What About Modern Art and Democracy?,"               Davis criticized capitalism for its tendency to manipulate the public               in its search for huge profits.&nbsp; In this article, Davis wrote               that capitalists use their wealth and influence to glorify the representational               art that depicts distinctly American subjects (the people, landscapes,               and buildings of the United States) in ways which emphasize their               American identity and values in order to exploit a reactionary,               provincial perspective of life that serves their hunger for profits.&nbsp;               He placed some of the blame for this exploitation on the public               itself, which he considers eager for advances in industrial commodities               but in favor of old-fashioned values in art and culture.&nbsp; Davis               wrote: </span></div>            <blockquote>               <div class=Section4 align="left"><span class="second">Business puts                 its weight behind glorifying an art, supposedly founded on sound                 American traditions, which exploits the American scene in terms                 of traditional and provincial ideology.... .&nbsp; The familiar,                 the literal, or the "folksy" is reiterated to the exclusion of                 new vision and new synthesis.&nbsp; The public....seems to want                 its artists' vision in traditional forms.&nbsp; Creative bathrooms                 and kitchens are eagerly desired, and we are told that it will                 soon be possible to bring home the dehydrated soup from the A                 &amp; P in a helicopter; but in cultural matters, nostalgia for                 the old frontiers tends to dim out the new frontiers already in                 view.... .&nbsp; Business approves of art, yes, but an art of                 the status quo to soothe the public mind and keep it on the beam....                 .<sup>12</sup></span></div>            </blockquote>            <div align="left"> </div>            <div class=Section5 align="left"> <span class="second"><i>Lucky Strike</i>               of 1921 [Fig. 1] features an array of fragmented motifs abstracted               from the packaging for that cigarette brand which have been juxtaposed               in bold, contrasting patterns.&nbsp; This painting captures the               effect of abrupt opposition and deformation found in Cubist collage,               but does so artificially, since it is entirely executed in oil.               &nbsp;The arrangement of forms loosely simulates what a cigarette               package would look like if dismantled and flattened.<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;               Davis seems to be using Cubism to analyze the visual logic and psychological               effects of commercial packaging.&nbsp; <i>Lucky Strike</i> engages               Crows claim that mass culture and high art are on parallel paths               in the search for greater understanding of life, except that the               relationship between mass culture and art in Davis painting is not               parallel: mass culture is drawn into art in the search for understanding.&nbsp;               Davis' works should not be taken as slavish, uncritical acceptance               or celebration of mass-media imagery and industrially-produced goods,               as they often are.&nbsp; In fact, skepticism may be imbued in many               of Davis' works.&nbsp; Perhaps the abrupt, confusing arrangement               of fragmented forms refers to the artificiality and deception of               clever package design and advertising, which is directed at consumers               and is intended to lure them into desiring and then purchasing an               item. Davis admitted in his essay on his 1951 painting <i>Visa</i>               [Fig. 2] that the painting was inspired by an advertisement in a               matchbook cover which he found boring and hoped to make interesting               in his series of paintings based on it.&nbsp; As with his paintings               of commercial products from the 1920s, <i>Visa</i> and the other               "Champion" paintings were initiated by contact with mass culture.&nbsp;               He said his use of the word "else," as in "something else" or "somewhere               else," indicated his belief that all subject matter was equivalent,               but that even though certain words would automatically convey specific               meanings, he chose to avoid conveying them, being more concerned               with formal issues.<sup>14</sup>&nbsp; However, considering the               continuity of Davis' theories, it is difficult to believe that "else"               is without any meanings other than purely formal effects.&nbsp;               Instead, the vagueness of "else" may refer to the monotony and simplicity               of mass-media imagery, that one image inspired by mass-media imagery               but then reconceptualized by the modern artist is nothing more or               less than something &quot;else&quot;.</span></div>            <div align="left"> </div>            <div class=Section6 align="left">               <table width="122" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">                <tr>                   <td class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('harte_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=750')"><img src="harte_2.jpg" width="180" height="336" border="0"></a></td>                </tr>                <tr valign="top">                   <td>                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                       2:</b> Visa, 1951</span></div>                  </td>                </tr>              </table>              <span class="second"><i>Visa</i> has the qualities of heavy-handed               and superficial excitement and pleasure, of easy and fleeting experience,               and intellectual banality for which mass culture has been derided               by many leading critics and theorists of modern art and culture,               including Clement Greenberg in "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" and Max               Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno in "Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction."&nbsp;               It achieves what Davis called "analogous dynamics," a quality he               sought in his art in order to give form to his response to mass               culture.&nbsp; The repetition of the basic composition in several               paintings, each one differing mostly in its color scheme, alludes               to the redundancy of mass culture about which many theorists have               been quite vociferous.&nbsp; This redundancy undermines the qualities               of originality and authenticity associated with works of art, qualities               Walter Benjamin described as the "aura" of the work of art.&nbsp;               Benjamin saw the aura of the work of art diminished by photography,               film, and advances in printing, which proliferated imagery during               the twentieth century.&nbsp; In the "Champion" series, the aura               of the work of art is diminished not by mechanical methods of visualization               and reproduction, but by the artist's repetition of the composition.&nbsp;               If <i>Visa</i> has the &quot;analogous dynamics&quot; of mass culture,               what if anything separates it and its sister paintings from mass               culture itself?&nbsp; What makes it &quot;art?&quot;&nbsp; Davis'               announced intention to make the found advertisement more interesting               has involved stripping the advertisement of its ease of comprehension,               thereby making it less effective in communicating commodity identity,               utility, and attractiveness. What makes this high art and a great               modern painting is the opposite of what made it effective commercial               packaging and popular culture.</span></div>            <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>            <p align="left" class="second"><font class="second"><a href="harte_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p align="left" class="second"><font class="second"><a href="harte_bio.html">Author's               Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> </p>            <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Herbert R.
