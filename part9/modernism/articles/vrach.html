                Whereas he had gained a measure of success in his lifetime, since                 his death his importance has faded while his impact on other American                 artists has been trivialized.&nbsp; The resulting lacuna of data                 combined with some fragmentary misinformation has also served                 to suppress his significance.&nbsp; Xceron's role as a vital link                 between what is commonly termed as the first-generation (the Stieglitz                 group, the Synchromists, etc.) and second-generation (the American                 Abstract Artists, the Transcendental Painting Group, George L.K.                 Morris, Ibram Lassaw, etc.) of abstract artists in America<sup>2</sup>                 and between the Parisian Cercle et Carr&eacute;, Abstraction Cr&eacute;ation                 and the American Abstract Artists groups in the thirties, should                 be recognized.&nbsp; The division between first and second generation                 American abstraction is a false one, resulting in the ironic belief                 that there was a break in American abstraction between the World                 Wars.&nbsp; As evinced by the existence and work of masters such                 as Xceron,<sup>3</sup> Arshile Gorky, Raymond Jonson, John Graham                 and many others, American abstraction never actually died out                 but became less popular between the World Wars.&nbsp; Furthermore,                 because Xceron's early works are unknown, he has been characterized                 by his best known, more familiar post-1940s style, which has been                 described as rectilinear, grid-like or Mondrianesque, another                 irony.<sup>4</sup> Consequently, Xceron has been placed within                 the category of second-generation American abstraction and his                 earlier accomplishments have been rendered obscure.&nbsp; However,                 a re-examination of the early sources and the recent discovery                 of Xceron works from the early 1930s reveals he was continuously                 creating abstract works from 1916 to 1932.&nbsp; After this period,                 Xceron's style became purely abstract and remained so for the                 rest of his life.&nbsp; In reviewing these thorny issues for the                 purpose of rectifying some commonly held misconceptions, the author                 hopes to clarify Xceron's meritorious role and its context in                 American art, and to bring about a better understanding of his                 painting.</span></p>              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Xceron's                 given name was Yiannis Xirocostas.&nbsp; He was born in 1890 in                 Isary, Greece, and came to the United States in 1904 at the age                 of fourteen. He lived with various relatives across the country                 until 1911-1912, when he began studying at the Corcoran School                 of Art in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; His surname was eventually changed                 to Xceron. He was called John (the English equivalent of Yannis)                 in America and <i>Jean</i>during the years he spent in France.&nbsp;                 In 1913, Xceron and his classmates Abraham Rattner, Leo Logasa                 and George Lohr, were deeply affected by the innovative style                 of the modern works in the Armory Show.&nbsp; In the Armory Show's                 aftermath and after several traveling venues some works from this                 show went to Alfred Stieglitz, whose gallery at that time was                 one of the few to champion modernism.&nbsp; Xceron and his colleagues                 borrowed some of the Armory Show works from Stieglitz to mount                 their own version of the show in Washington, D.C.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;                 Consequently, Xceron and his cadre earned reputations as revolutionaries                 for attempting C&eacute;zannesque interpretations of their subjects                 rather than following prescribed academic methods.</span></p>            </div>            <div class=Section3>               <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">After                 graduating from the Corcoran, Xceron went to New York to study                 independently, and by 1920 was exhibiting with the Society of                 Independent Artists and associating with its member artists Joseph                 Stella, Max Weber, and Abraham Walkowitz. &nbsp;A representative                 work of that period is <i>Landscape #36</i>, 1923, a gouache on                 board, which is a study after Cezanne that demonstrates Xceron's                 expertise with transparent space that would be recognized as a                 key characteristic of his mature style.&nbsp; A cottage in the                 woods is depicted in passages of brown, green, and neutral shades                 and exhibits various figure-ground ambiguities as a result of                 the interchangeability of the rectangular strokes. The tree trunks                 on the right of the composition are clearly read as foreground                 whereas the tree shapes on the left appear to be in the middle                 ground and to pull towards the back.

To complicate things further, Hilla Rebay, then                 the director of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now known                 as the Solomon R.Guggenheim Museum of Art), employed both John                 (in French <i>Jean</i>) Xceron and John Graham.&nbsp; Consequently,                 American critics often confused the two painters and attributed                 credit to John Graham for David Smith's biomorphic or Surrealist                 influences while a closer inspection of the documents and a re-examination                 of dates and facts renders proof that it was Xceron whom Smith                 was thanking in his letters for Xceron's influence and advice.<sup>13</sup>.</span></p>            </div>            <div class=Section7>               <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">An                 event of special significance to American artists in 1935 was                 Xceron's Garland Gallery exhibition, but the reasons for this                 success are not immediately evident until the art and political                 contexts of New York in 1935 are scrutinized.<sup>14</sup> Then                 it is discovered that exhibitions containing abstract art, such                 as Xceron's, were rare events and that American artists were eager                 to see the latest styles from Paris.&nbsp; The Depression had                 taken its toll and the prevalent artistic styles were figurative,                 while abstraction was still considered experimental and unsuitable                 for expressing political polemic.&nbsp; The brothers Max and Joseph                 Felshin, early advocates of abstraction, owned the Garland Gallery                 on 57<sup>th</sup> Street.&nbsp; But since the gallery's closing                 in the early forties, the Felshins have fallen into obscurity,                 leaving us with very little documentation on the history of this                 space.&nbsp; In fact, only a careful reconstruction of the events                 from various archives rendered proof of&nbsp; which Xceron works                 were shown at the Garland, what was their style, and what were                 some of the names of those who attended the events.&nbsp; In discovering                 the Felshin paintings <i>Composition 120</i>, 1934 (Fig. 1) and                 <i>La Musique</i>, 1933, it is evidenced that Xceron was working                 in abstract biomorphism foreshadowing many Americans, such as                 Gorky, and that stylistically and chronologically these paintings                 are consistent with those of the same period in the Zervos Collection.&nbsp;                 However, Xceron's impact on American artists can be found not                 only in the numerous interviews and writings by Ilya Bolotowsky,                 David Smith, and Borgoyne Diller, but also in comparisons between                 their works and his.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp; As an avant-garde exhibition                 of the latest styles from Paris, the 1935 Xceron show at the Garland                 garnered profuse press reviews. Some of these were very positive                 and most demonstrated the contextual proclivity for figurative                 models of art which, rather than hindering the reception of Xceron's                 work, made it all the more appealing to abstract artists in America.&nbsp;                 That Xceron also enjoyed some commercial success at this time                 is seen by the addition of his works to Eugene Gallatin's Museum                 of Living Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Phillips Memorial                 Collection.&nbsp; In addition, the artist also held the distinction                 of being one of the earliest abstractionists to be offered a position                 with the WPA/FAP at its inauguration in 1935, in Washington, D.C.;                 but rather than accept it, he returned to Paris for another two                 years.<sup>16</sup></span></p>            </div>            <span class="second"><br clear=ALL style='page-break-before:auto;mso-break-type:section-break'>            </span>            <div class=Section8>               <table width="149" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="262">                <tr>                   <td><span class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('vrach_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=700')"><img src="vrach_2.jpg" width="188" height="240" alt="Click for Larger Image" border="0"></a></span></td>                </tr>                <tr valign="top">                   <td bgcolor="ffffff" height="18">                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                       2:<i> Collage</i></b><i>.</i> 1932</span></div>                  </td>                </tr>              </table>              <p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:0in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in right 6.0in'><span class="second">Remaining                 in Paris until 1937, when the increasingly fascist political climate                 became intolerable for artists, Xceron returned home to America                 permanently.&nbsp; However, during these two years abroad, Xceron                 continued his activities with the Parisian avant-garde and the                 group<i> Abstraction Cr&eacute;ation</i>, while exhibiting with                 the <i>Surindependents</i>, <i>Realit&eacute;s Nouvelles</i>and                 <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>.&nbsp; Xceron's early Greek rearing among                 the classical antiquities in his native town and an education                 in classical philosophy, instilled in him the need for synthesis                 equated with the ideal; and by 1935 he combined the biomorphic                 with increasingly strong compositional order as seen in his <i>Collage</i>of                 1932.

                A public debate ensued as the American Abstract Artists collectively                 objected to Rebay's "ivory tower" aesthetics stating that abstract                 art is part of life: "having basis in living actuality." <sup>19</sup>                 The political climate of the United States in the late thirties                 and early forties was not sympathetic to abstraction, and pandered                 to public opinion informed by the need to express clarity and                 national values.&nbsp; Consequently, American abstract artists                 felt unsupported by the Museum of Non-Objective Art, whose collection                 contained works idiosyncratically defined by Rebay as "non-objective"                 art, and the Museum of Modern Art, which owned mostly European                 works.&nbsp; They also felt betrayed by the public who preferred                 figuration.&nbsp; Abstractionists were criticized for being apolitical                 or unpatriotic because their styles were perceived as incapable                 of expressing political ideology.&nbsp; Abstract artists objected                 to Rebay's idiosyncratic use of the term "non-objective" to define                 abstract art. <sup>18</sup>&nbsp; An example of the negative press                 Rebay received was written by Charles Robbins, who claimed to                 represent public sentiment: "As a glance at the examples on this                 page will show, non-objective painting to the uninitiated, looks                 like a cross between a doodle and a blueprint drawn by a cockeyed                 draughtsman on a spree." <sup>19</sup>&nbsp; Difficult as that                 period was for Xceron and American abstract artists, and despite                 his problematic and precarious political situation, he was an                 important link between American and European art when many European                 artists (such as Leger, Mondrian, and H&eacute;lion) immigrated                 to America as Fascism rose in Europe.&nbsp; Many of them joined                 the American Abstract Artists.&nbsp; This group was known for                 its proclivity towards a rectilinear style inspired by Mondrian                 who immigrated to the United States in 1941 and who joined this                 group.&nbsp; In the forties, Xceron was also working in a linear                 style, but not with pure colors as Mondrian and not in strict                 geometry.&nbsp; Nevertheless, American audiences are most familiar                 with this period of his work, ergo the assumption that he was                 a follower of Mondrian.&nbsp; It was to Xceron that Mondrian first                 wrote for help when fascist Europe became too dangerous for artists                 to stay.&nbsp; In the end, Xceron could not invite Mondrian, who                 was aided by Harry Holtzman instead, but they remained friends                 from their Paris days in 1928 until the older master's death in                 1944.&nbsp; A typical Xceron composition is an oil on canvas such                 as <i>Painting #294</i>of 1946 (Fig. 4), in which the artist's                 rectilinear preferences of that era are seen in the grid-like                 elements both at the top and bottom left sectors.&nbsp; However,                 unlike the flat, opaque, coloristic tendencies in Bolotowsky's                 or Diller's paintings, Xceron's modulated shades of plum and lilac                 fade into the distance to imply transparent space.<br clear=ALL style='page-break-before:auto;mso-break-type:section-break'>                </span></p>            </div>            <div class=Section10>               <table width="181" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="174">                <tr>                   <td><span class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('vrach_4.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=450')"><img src="vrach_4.jpg" width="216" height="180" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></span></td>                </tr>                <tr valign="top">                   <td bgcolor="ffffff" height="13">                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                       4:<i> </i></b><i>Painting #294</i><b><i>, </i></b>1946</span></div>                  </td>                </tr>              </table>              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span class="second">In                 the forties and fifties, Xceron was the custodian of paintings                 for the Guggenheim Museum, whose collection was housed at a Manhattan                 warehouse.&nbsp; He was allowed to paint there in his spare time                 while also receiving many visitors.&nbsp; Mark Rothko, David Smith,                 Ibram Lassaw, Ilya Bolotowsky, Will Barnet, William Baziotes,                 and Nassos Daphnis are some of the many artists to whom Xceron                 showed his and the Guggenheim's paintings.&nbsp; Most were familiar                 with Xceron's work through their reproduction in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>and                 the 1935 Garland Gallery show.&nbsp; Xceron enjoyed many solo                 exhibitions and was included in most of the Guggenheim non-objective                 painting group exhibitions throughout his life.&nbsp; The artist                 also showed with such venues as the American Abstract Artists,                 American Federation of Artists, Carnegie Institute, Federation                 of Modern Painters and Sculptors, International Council of the                 Museum of Modern Art, Salon de Realit&eacute;s Nouvelles, Salon                 des Surindependants, Society of Independent Artists, Toledo Museum                 of Art, University of Illinois, and the Whitney Museum of American                 Art.&nbsp; By 1946, Xceron had achieved further prominence and                 was commissioned by the University of Georgia to do a painting                 that he entitled <i>Radar</i>(Fig. 5), which reflects the contemporary                 interest in the marriage of art and science. <sup>20</sup>&nbsp;                 This oil on canvas encapsulates Xceron's oeuvre up to that time                 due to its softly modulated floating spatial organization, which                 contains positive and negative circular geometric and gestural                 forms radiating out that are echoed throughout its surface.&nbsp;                 This important work was widely publicized and marks Xceron's active                 engagement with the style that would later become known as Abstract                 Expressionism.</span></p>              <table width="75" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="211">                <tr>                   <td><span class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('vrach_5.html','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=450')"><img src="vrach_5.jpg" width="120" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></span></td>                </tr>                <tr valign="top">                   <td bgcolor="ffffff" height="11">                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                       5:<i> </i></b><i>Radar</i><b><i>, </i></b>1946</span></div>                  </td>                </tr>              </table>              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Finally,                 through contextualization and examination of newly found key works,                 the author hopes that Xceron's contributions to American art between                 the World Wars has been clarified, bridging the falsely created                 gap in American abstraction between the assumed division of first                 and second generations.&nbsp; The detection of the Zervos Dada                 automatist works in addition to the Felshin surrealist pieces,                 along with the recently found documents, have supported Xceron's                 position in early American abstraction, and have proved that American                 abstraction certainly never died but rather that its popularity                 sometimes waned.&nbsp; Xceron created art in an abstracted style                 starting in 1916 while at the Corcoran, and by 1927 he had engaged                 in automatist drawings and collages, resulting in total abstraction                 by 1933-34 in the Zervos and Felshin works.&nbsp; As such, he                 is one of the enduring masters of American modern art who persevered                 in his engagement with abstraction up to his death in 1967. </span></p>              <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>            </div>            <p><font class="second"><a href="vrach_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="vrach_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp;
