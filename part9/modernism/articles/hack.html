Framing America: A Social History               of American Art. New York: Thames and Hudson, 2002<br>              <br>              Bjelajac, David. American Art: A Cultural History. Upper Saddle               (NJ): Prentice Hall, 2000.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              In history&#146;s dead and drought-dry fields the gleaners of meaning               gather and weave their strands into deceptively palatable truths.               Our understanding of time&#151;perhaps itself a delusion of convenience&#151;abets               our innate penchant for narrative as we drape the objects of the               world beneath a concealing curtain of words. History requires a               faith more fervent than any religious ideology; to believe in the               past may, in a sense, be both a defining characteristic and a fundamental               sensory error of the human animal. To avoid the alternative&#151;a               faith in the perpetual now, the eternal moment defined not by time               but by change&#151;we create a sense of the past, a web of connections               which places people, events and objects into fathomable contexts.               <br>              Paradoxically, contextualization both blinds and reveals; although               examining artworks through political, social, philosophical, scientific,               and art historical lenses offers comforting insights otherwise invisible,               it is arguable (and has been argued) that there are meanings beyond               the scope of contextual analysis. Not that meaning is purely a relative               social construction; I would argue rather that the truly important               meanings are often beyond the limits of immediate cognition or,               at the very least, beyond the academic process of time/space contextualization.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              We arrange the objects of the world into patterns of influence.               Imagine a billion card tables&#151;each piled high with past and               present jigsaw puzzle pieces. From these tables we choose a select               few pieces from which to construct stories, often force-fitting               incongruous puzzle pieces into tidy narratives. Inevitably, puzzles               could be assembled with pieces that fit perfectly, although the               finished image would be undecipherable. Seldom would, and seldom               do, the pieces and the resultant image match perfectly. Every so               often pieces are exchanged to accommodate current sensibilities;               these rejected objects and the ideas that accompany them then are               thrown back onto the pile, orphaned from the narrative until a later               moment when perhaps they will reappear as lost or overlooked or               understudied but nevertheless crucial to the understanding of the               present. If we could glimpse even momentarily the predicament that               confronts us&#151;the sheer volume of the puzzle pieces and the               humbling awareness that the tenuous connections that connect them               may be illusory at best&#151;our self-assigned task of making sense               of images would not be the smugly elite refuge it may appear to               some outside the field.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              As art historians, our mission is just this: to examine the objects               made by those in a time and space (presumably) different from the               present moment and to assign them possible meanings based on contextualization.               These interpretations or narratives are then taught to others through               texts and lectures&#151;more often than not through that most honored               of educational treatises, the survey textbook. It is through such               texts that the need for grand-scheme, large picture narrative is               most apparent: survey texts provide the outline; additional courses               and texts fill in the corollaries. Needless to say, surveys are               necessary simplifications&#151;abridgements of events too numerous               to comprehend. One would be hard-pressed, however, to consider an               alternative that provides the scope and conciseness of a survey,               as their practicality makes up for their deficiencies.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Assigning a survey text is assigning a belief in the narrative structure.               While many in the postmodern mode of thought readily admit there               are countless narratives&#151;those of previously ignored groups               in particular&#151;it is less frequently admitted that our very               notion of the narrative is perhaps not only inadequate but also               erroneous. Some surveys attempt to atone by offering a thematic               but chronological approach, realizing that neither is singularly               adequate to understanding the meanings of a work of art. The purely               thematic approach lacks chronology; the chronological, social contextualization.               What is needed is an entirely new manner of viewing objects that               is not stymied by the illusory constraints of context or chronology.               Is such a vision possible? Is it advisable? Is it practical?</p>            <p class="second"><br>              American Art instructors have no doubt wrestled with such issues               when deciding which survey text is best for classroom instruction.               Wayne Craven&#146;s American Art: History and Culture has been a               time-honored text, although some instructors may feel less than               compelled to follow its rigid divisions by medium and period. Its               strength is that its reliance on the facts allows for the application               of a myriad of methodologies. In recent years several textbooks               have emerged that offer more contextual approaches: Frances K. Pohl&#146;s               Framing America: A Social History of American Art and David Bjelajac&#146;s               American Art: A Cultural History.<br>              Pohl&#146;s survey&#151;a mighty tome that will no doubt unravel               the seams of bookbags and young spines nationwide&#151;reveals both               the soaring heights and dreary depths of postmodern thought. Far               from a chronological run-through of canonical expectations, Framing               America examines American art and artifacts through thematic divisions               (such as Art and Conquest; Nature and Nation; and Work and Art)               that explore art&#146;s relation to the social attitudes of its               historical moment. The result is an often-refreshing selection of               artworks, such as Emanuel Leutze&#146;s The Storming of the Teocalli               by Cortez and His Troops (1848), Albert Weinert&#146;s Haymarket               Monument (1893), and Jos&eacute; Clemente Orozco&#146;s Prometheus               (1930). Although this is a welcome attempt to expand the definition               and cultural boundaries of American art to include Native American,               African American, and Latin American artists, it could be argued               that a wider vision of &#147;Art of the Americas&#148; is necessary               to attain a more accurate portrayal and understanding.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              As one might expect, much is made of the fact that American attitudes               of the past are less than flattering (Framing America becomes an               obvious double-entendre&#151;whether or not America is unjustly               framed in the textbook remains an issue of personal opinion). Images               such as Harriet Cany Peale&#146;s Her Mistress&#146;s Clothes (1848)               and an 1860 advertisement for baking powder that features an eager-to-please               &#147;mammy&#148; seem included merely as reflections of racist               attitudes. While it is refreshing to see such uncommon images in               survey texts, one occasionally senses that the theme at hand takes               precedence over the works themselves. <br>              We find ourselves at an interesting junction: Connoisseurship, no               longer a primary concern for the art historian (for better or worse),               has given way to an unprecedented freedom: all images are worthy               of examination regardless of aesthetic quality, provided they help               us better contextualize and create meaning. In theory this seems               a plausible starting point. Material and popular culture are, without               question, important avenues of exploration. Is it more important               for students to study a racist ad or a navy recruitment poster,               however, than, say, even one work by Thomas Sully, William Rush,               Alexander Jackson Davis, Sanford Gifford, Horatio Greenough, Erastus               Dow Palmer, John Quincy Adams Ward, Clark Mills, Henry Kirke Brown,               William Wetmore Story, Randolph Rogers, William Rimmer, H.H. Richardson,               William Morris Hunt, Elihu Vedder, or Albert Pinkham Ryder (to name               just a few of the unmentioned artists)?</p>            <p class="second"><br>              One could argue that Framing America strives to divert us from the               narrative of these canonical figures by offering different pathways.               It is a useful textbook in this regard, if one is interested in               teaching social history without imposing a canon of well-known American               artworks (Is it really important for students to be aware of Sargent&#146;s               Madame X or Allston&#146;s Belshazzar&#146;s Feast?). Paintings               typically relegated to the kitsch category&#151;early twentieth               century paintings of Native Americans, for example&#151;are given               ample attention (Some of these paintings are quite interesting,               although some well-known artists that helped create a mythic conception               of the West and Native Americans, such as George de Forest Brush,               are not included).<br>              It must be said, however, that the works that are included are discussed               in a clear and yet thorough manner&#151;Pohl assembles current art               historical interpretations on each work, diligently and admirably               noting the ideas of particular scholars. This approach of giving               credit where credit is due within the text itself is a welcome sight               in a survey textbook, where traditionally the author assumes the               mantle of all-encompassing authority.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              One problem of a thematic approach, however, is that it tends to               pigeonhole certain artists and artworks. Henry Ossawa Tanner, for               instance, is offered not as an important proponent of Orientalism               or as a realist in the Eakins tradition but as a &#147;Precursor               to the Harlem Renaissance&#148; (no doubt true, but it is only one               way of looking at Tanner&#146;s work). An equally relevant art historical               move would be to place Tanner in the tradition of Delacroix or,               perhaps more accurately, the influential Spanish painter Mariano               Fortuny. Similarly, Lilly Martin Spencer&#146;s works are seen less               as important genre paintings than as indications of the male dominated               society that defines women as domestic toilers. The dilemma for               postmodern textbook authors is how to both define and separate previously               marginalized groups by the hardships they faced (racism, sexism)               while inserting them into the ever-growing, ever-changing canon.               [On a personal note, I have always believed that for students, the               &#147;canon&#148; consists mainly of those works that are taught&#151;these               are the works that art history students will see as the core images               they will then teach to others. The canon is perpetually created               and then repeated. Perhaps this is the lesson of textbooks such               as Framing America. In the end, though, the very idea of a canon               exists only in our heads.]</p>            <p class="second"><br>              There are some aspects of American art little explored in Framing               America: Little is mentioned of neoclassical expatriate sculptors               and sculpture, aside from the obligatory nod to Hiram Powers&#146;s               The Greek Slave and the work of Harriet Hosmer (represented by two               works) and Edmonia Lewis (represented by three works). Augustus               Saint-Gaudens receives a single mention with The Shaw Memorial,               included primarily for its status as a &#147;monument to freedom.&#148;               Hosmer and Lewis are important for a number of reasons, but there               needs to be a more even-handedness when deciding who to slight and               who to champion.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              For those who want to push the study of artworks beyond notions               of gender, race, and colonization, Framing America may prove a frustrating               account. But it is by no means an uninteresting one&#151;on the               contrary, Pohl provides a great many insights by raising these issues,               and offers serious students of American Art a substantial art historical               foundation, despite the obvious omission of several key artworks.               For those works that are covered, Pohl has deftly relayed the contemporary               thought on their potential meanings without asserting those meanings               as truth. Pohl&#146;s methodology suggests that interpretations               are always in flux, offering both past and contemporary viewpoints.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Yet it is this diligence to modern interpretation that makes such               texts difficult to use in the classroom if those particular issues               are not shared interests of the professor. When every artwork under               scrutiny is seen only as an emblem of colonialism and conquest,               it is difficult to explore other issues and influences without creating               a discrepancy between what is being taught and what is being read.<br>              A more manageable effort is David Bjelajac&#146;s American Art:               A Cultural History. Smaller in size, American Art nevertheless covers               critical social issues without compromising canonical figures and               artworks. Bjelajac similarly divides the historical narrative into               cultural themes&#151;for example, The Invention and Mapping of America,               Religious Rituals, National Identity, and Gilded Age Commerce&#151;without               circumscribing the social attitudes of the past around each artwork.               Admittedly, very few of the artists mentioned above as having been               omitted from Framing America are to be found in Bjelajac&#146;s               American Art. Although this may represent a changing notion of the               canon, it is understandable that a relatively in-depth survey devoted               to social history can only deal with a limited number of works.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Nevertheless, American Art: A Cultural History makes an admirable               effort to blend social commentary with canonical artworks, while               offering discussions of such uncommon choices as Jeremiah Pearson               Hardy&#146;s Catherine Wheeler Hardy and Her Daughter (1842) and               Thomas Satterwhite Noble&#146;s The Price of Blood (1868). Although               less heavy-handed with his sense of social injustice, Bjelajac addresses               a wide variety of postmodern concerns through inclusion of works               such as Horatio Greenough&#146;s much-maligned The Rescue (1837-53)               and Edmonia Lewis&#146;s Forever Free (1867). What is remarkable               is that Bjelajac has both embraced and opened the canon by presenting               traditionally examined artworks along with those by artists such               as John Valentine Haidt, Margaret Foley and Elaine de Kooning.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              An unusual but fascinating element of American Art is Bjelajac&#146;s               interest in Freemasonry, a theme that meanders throughout the text.               With the prevalence of Masonic symbolism in American decorative               arts (chairs, Masonic aprons, tankards and membership certificates),               it is without question that freemasonry played a significant role               in the development of American intellectual and artistic life (Paul               Revere, Benjamin Franklin, De Witt Clinton, painter Ezra Ames, artist               and author William Dunlap, architect Robert Mills, and sculptors               Gutzon Borglum and Charles Keck were among the many artists and               thinkers who were dedicated freemasons). Bjelajac gives Masonic               influence the attention it deserves in an American art survey text               without overstating its importance.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              Both texts are welcome additions to the table, as the direction               such texts are taking&#151;social context over formal or aesthetic               considerations&#151;can only assist the pedagogical process. Ultimately               there is no perfect textbook, and it is fortunate that few of us               expect textbooks to present every artist and every artwork that               will be shown and discussed in class. It remains our task to assemble               the puzzle pieces of canonical American art, those tenuous filaments               of meaning that conveniently dwell within.</p>            <p align="left" class="second"><font class="second"><a href="hack_bio.html">Author's               Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font> </p>            <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Brian Hack.
