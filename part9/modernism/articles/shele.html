It seemed so, and thisis my first such intimation--it                  was an artist presence ofdeep, gentle power--remote, but directed                  toward me. So itseemed the abstractions must go on, not to stop                  them ever,from discouragement.<sup>1</sup> </p>             </blockquote>                         <p><br>             </p>                         <table width="148" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="214">               <tbody>                <tr>                 <td><a href="javascript:;" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('shele_1.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=500')"><img src="shele_1.jpg" width="143" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0">                  </a></td>               </tr>               <tr valign="top">                 <td>                                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="shele_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                      1:</b> LightCenter<i>, </i></a>1961</div>                 </td>               </tr>                           </tbody>            </table>                         <p>In this reflection, Pelton merged the presence of a divinitywith                the spirit of the artist, a combination of religion andart that                often found outlet in her painting. Pelton&#8217;s self-declared               &#8220;life&#8217;s work&#8221; was to create meaningful abstractions,               her &#8220;windows to an inner realm,&#8221; &#8220;the exploration               of places not yet visited.&#8221; Abstractions, for Pelton, were               &#8220;a new way of seeing.&#8221;<sup>2</sup><br>               Meditation, receptivity, study, and divine inspiration createdPelton&#8217;s                abstractions. She worked on individual paintingssporadically for                months, sometimes for years. Pelton&#8217;s powerfuldrive to paint                these inner visions also developed over timeand resulted from multiple                causes. Pelton&#8217;s work in abstractionbegan during the first                two decades of the 1900s when she livedin New York City and continued                throughout her life. She wasworking on her final painting, Light                Center (fig. 1), whenshe died in 1961, at her home in the desert                community of CathedralCity, California. </p>                         <p><br>               In particular, subjects, symbols, and influences suggestedby Pelton&#8217;s                abstractions can be linked to aspects of her life.Entwined with                the personal and biographical is Pelton&#8217;s immersionin the                natural world, the cosmos, mysticism, and the occult.<sup>3</sup>Further,                the abstractions express reflections about nature,sexuality, intellect,                and creativity. Even more, her worksembody a developing spirituality                and make clear her life&#8217;spurpose: to use abstractions to convey                her &#8220;light messageto the world.&#8221;<sup>4</sup></p>                         <p><br>               A student of Arthur Wesley Dow and Hamilton Easter Field,<sup>5</sup>Pelton                was already an accomplished painter of representativefigures and                landscapes when she exhibited in the Armory Showin 1913. In the                1910s, Pelton&#8217;s imaginative paintings weresimilar in style                to those of Arthur B. Davies and featuredwispy, young ing&eacute;nues                surrounded by natural landscapes.Even with her early work, Pelton                explored abstract conceptswhich she identified in titles, like                Supremacy (1915), Power(1916), Inward Joy (1915), Thought (1916,                Peace (1922), andVision (1915).<sup>6</sup> Throughout her more than sixty               professional years of painting, Pelton continued to complete portraits,               landscapes, and floral scenes to make a living, but she dedicated               her soul to abstraction.</p>                         <p><br>               Abstraction became Pelton&#8217;s visual representation of a spiritual               quest. She explored multiple ideologies as she developed herown                iconography. Because she believed the Presbyterian andfundamentalist                beliefs of her ancestors were both sociallyand personally flawed,                Pelton investigated and embraced thetenets of Agni Yoga,<sup>7</sup> Theosophy,<sup>8</sup> other Eastern religionsand New Age philosophies. Pelton was also                a &#8220;sensitive,&#8221;<sup>9</sup>believed in auras, made personal choices                based on numerology,and explained physical ailments through astrological                chartings.Through the years, she studied the teachings of Annie                Besantand Charles Leadbeater, Krishnamurti, and Shambhala. In her               abstractions, Pelton expressed a strong inner response to life,               including sexuality and creativity. Through her abstractions, she               explored the outer cosmos and her view of an inner world.            </p>                         <p><br>               Pelton outlined her purpose for painting in a journal entryentitled                &#8220;Knowledge.&#8221; She copied the following passage froman                unidentified Theosophist: &#8220;Spiritual transactions mustbe translated                into the language of mortal senses that theybe understood, so as                to be of practical benefit to mortalswho desire to be redeemed                from mortality.&#8221; These words articulatePelton&#8217;s design--to                translate spiritual messages with herpaintings. In brackets on                that page, she added her own comments:&#8220;This is where the forms                of the natural world must appearin a picture, or can do so--not                for themselves but to conveythought as future light.&#8221;<sup>10 			  </sup> Thus,                light isa both a symbol and a subject in Pelton&#8217;s abstractions.                Itrepresents enlightenment and ecstasy; it also suggests inspiration               and the creative force.</p>                         <p><br>               The principles of Theosophy provided a spiritual groundingfor Pelton.                In her journal, she often quoted Helena Blavatsky,but in another                journal entry, she referred to L. W. Rogers&#8217;The Elementary                Theosophy. In particular, she noted Rogers&#8217;reference to &#8220;the                ray,&#8221; always present in Theosophical teachings.Pelton copied:                &#8220;It [the ray] is literally a spark of the divinefire. . .an                emanation of God&#8221; that comes to earth and touchesthe soul.<sup>11</sup> Pelton gave form to this passage in her abstraction,The Ray,                1931 (fig. 2). In this abstraction, she connectsthe earthly world                with the shaft of light slanted upward.The flower, centered at                the base of the column of light, symbolizeshuman creativity; the                light source directs the spirit&#8217;s journeyupward. </p>                         <p><br>             </p>                         <table width="128" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="214">               <tbody>                <tr>                 <td height="206"><a href="javascript:;" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('shele_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=500')"><img src="shele_2.jpg" width="160" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0">                  </a></td>               </tr>               <tr valign="top">                 <td bgcolor="#ffffff">                                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="shele_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                      2:</b> TheRay<i>, </i></a>1931</div>                 </td>               </tr>                           </tbody>            </table>                         <p>Pelton was drawn to Theosophy because it emphasized knowledgeand                good work. It also afforded her a network of practitioners,if and                when she needed support or encouragement. Generally,Pelton worked                alone in her studio, without frequent contactwith other artists.                However, in 1928-29, she associated witha spiritualist colony called                the Glass Hive<sup>12</sup> inPasadena, California. Leaving her                studio in New York City,Pelton planned to visit her friend Emma                Newton in Pasadenafor an extended stay. Newton introduced Pelton                to Will LevingtonComfort, the leader of the Glass Hive, and both                women becameactive with the Hive. <br>               Comfort claimed &#8220;not to be a Theosophist, nor cultist of any               kind,&#8221; yet his beliefs were based on a variety of works, some               he named specifically, including the Bible, Annie Besant&#8217;s               Thought-Power and Blavatsky&#8217;s Theosophical treatises. He also               mentioned &#8220;straight Hindu literature,&#8221; Alfred Pierce Signet&#8217;s               Esoteric Buddhism (1894), the Bhagavad Gila, and the wordsof Swami                Vivekananda.<sup>13</sup> Pelton, who had also notedthese works                in her journal, shared a bond with the other artistsand writers                associated with the Hive. Further, she embracedComfort&#8217;s philosophy                that meditation prepared the way foran inward journey toward harmony,                peace and purpose. Duringthose months in Pasadena, Pelton&#8217;s                creativity soared.</p>                         <p><br>             </p>                         <table width="97" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="195">               <tbody>                <tr>                 <td><a href="javascript:;" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('shele_3.html','part','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="shele_3.jpg" width="167" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0">                  </a></td>               </tr>               <tr valign="top">                 <td bgcolor="#ffffff">                                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="shele_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                      3:</b> Ecstacy,1928</a></div>                 </td>               </tr>                           </tbody>            </table>                         <p>The Glass Hive was more than an esoteric group of artistsand writers                exchanging ideas. To Comfort, it was an importantlink to building                a stronger, more civilized world. Membershipin the Hive fluctuated,                as connections to the group extendednationwide; individuals participated                at various levels, someonly through the publications, others through                associationwith those who knew Comfort&#8217;s books, letters, and                periodicals.For five years, 1927-32, Comfort edited a small journal,                TheGlass Hive, which stated the group&#8217;s philosophy and made                clearits connection to the Aquarian Foundation. Articles in The               Glass Hive covered subjects ranging from astrology to the principles               of Agni Yoga, to the cosmos, to communism, to current issueslike                the &#8220;marriage&#8221; question, to the creative process, ingeneral,                and the production of art, in particular.

During that 1928-1929 trip to Pasadena, forexample,                Pelton developed a lasting friendship with Comfort&#8217;sdaughter                Jane. They exchanged letters for more than twenty-fiveyears, and                discussed topics such as creativity, astronomy,spirituality, meditation,                landscape, painting, writing, health,family, and friendship. While                part of the Hive in 1929, Peltonpainted and first exhibited Jane&#8217;s                striking portrait and createdIncarnation, an abstraction she dedicated                to Jane Comfort.Moreover, during her stay in Pasadena Pelton exhibited                Ecstasy,1928 (fig. 3), and did sketches for Star Gazer, 1929 (fig.               4).<sup>15</sup> </p>                         <p><br>             </p>                         <p>The environment around the Hive encouraged individual, creative               activity. Pelton not only focused on the spiritual quest,but she                also explored the physical world. She may have donesketches for                one of her first desert landscapes, CaliforniaLandscape Near Pasadena,                dated 1930. At nearby HuntingtonBotanical Gardens, she filled her                sketchbook with detaileddrawings of flower heads and stems. Based                on her dated sketches,the Huntington Gardens were the probable                inspiration for herpainting, Lotus for Lida, 1929 (fig. 5), which                can be consideredone of the earliest abstractions painted in California.              </p>                         <p><br>               While in Pasadena, Pelton exhibited abstractions, floral works,               landscapes, and portraits at the Grace Nicholson Art Galleriesin                Pasadena and a select group of abstractions at Jake ZeitlinBooks                in Los Angeles. All her activity attracted notice. Reviewersin                the Los Angeles Herald called her paintings &#8220;abstractionsexternalized                on canvas&#8221; and touted them as &#8220;program musicof the imagination.&#8221;<sup>16</sup>               Pelton was pleased with thepublic reception of her abstractions                in Los Angeles and enthusiasticallyplanned an exhibition in New                York City at the Montross Galleryfor the following November. A                letter to her friend Mabel DodgeLuhan in Taos, in October 1929,                confirmed her expectations:            </p>                         <blockquote>                             <p><br>                 I am about to start on for me--a real adventure, an exhibition                 of my &#8220;Abstractions&#8221; at the Montross Gallery. . . .If                 you think of any of your friends whom you think would be interested,                 I would appreciate it if you would send their names fora catalogue.

Her works exude a timelessness, a journey towardecstasy                in the natural world or in space beyond.<br>               It is the multivalent concepts of the term &#8220;ecstasy&#8221; which               lead to the personal in Pelton&#8217;s abstractions. Connotations               of ecstasy reach toward physical pleasure, religious understanding,               intellectual enlightenment, and spiritual transcendence. Whenshe                painted her flowering abstraction Ecstasy in 1928 (fig.3), Pelton                entered a cultural debate about the meaning ofthe abstract concept                of ecstasy. Other artists of the time,too, explored ecstasy as                a subject in abstraction, includingher friend and peer, Raymond                Jonson. </p>                         <p><br>             </p>                         <table width="18" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="94">               <tbody>                <tr>                 <td><a href="shele_5.html"><img src="shele_5.jpg" width="74" height="144" alt="Lotus for Lida">                  </a></td>               </tr>               <tr valign="top">                 <td bgcolor="#ffffff" height="14">                                     <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="shele_5.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                      5:</b> Lotusfor Lida, 1929</a></div>                 </td>               </tr>                           </tbody>            </table>                         <p>Based in the writing and thinking of the time, there is noquestion                that the term ecstasy implied both a sexual and aspiritual release.                For example, Will Comfort and Mary Austinwere two writers, known                by Pelton, who discussed ecstasy indetail. Comfort, for instance,                described the exquisite momentof physical ecstasy in his biography,                Midstream, which Peltonread soon after its publication in 1914.                Comfort said, &#8220;Thewords from the lips of a woman in the ecstasy                of love aremystical, vibrant from the very source of things. .                . .Theman who is not hushed in the presence of it, is not sensitive               to divine presence. . . .She is a love-instrument played upon by               creative light.&#8221;<sup>18</sup> Comfort mixed the physical with               the divine, but he also linked ecstasy to the creative processwhen                he stated, &#8220;There is an ecstasy in the first view ofone&#8217;s                unborn realizations.&#8221;<sup>19</sup> </p>                         <p><br>               Austin expressed her views about religious and sexual ecstasywhile                she was living in New Mexico in 1919. That year, Peltonspent time                with Austin in Taos as part of Mabel Dodge Luhan&#8217;scircle.                The women undoubtedly exchanged views on ecstasy,as it was a topic                Austin heatedly debated in a series of letterswritten in 1919 to                Theodore Schroeder<sup>20</sup> of theSchool of American Research in Santa                Fe. In those letters,Austin appeared to share the same ideas that                Comfort had espousedwhen she said, &#8220;Sex always stirs the part                of women which isclosest in touch with the Law of Life. Sex is                the preludeto the great experience of continuity of life, so that                thereis nothing abnormal, nothing that requires a special explanation               in the close association of sex experience and religious experience.&#8221;              She added, &#8220;Love and religion are like two strings on a musical               instrument. You cannot pluck strongly at one without raisingovertones                in the other.&#8221;<sup>21</sup> Austin disagreed withSchroeder&#8217;s insistence                that religion was a debased and pervertedsex experience. For Austin,                sex and religion were separateentities, she said, but she did allow                that for other women,religion often became the outlet for sexual                energy.<sup>22</sup>However, in another letter, Austin described the ecstatic               states she experienced as intellectual, and religious, noting that               the &#8220;result of a subconscious perception of truth&#8221; has               a &#8220;pale glow of exactly the same thing that accompanies religious               ecstasy.&#8221;<sup>23</sup> Often, the intellectual, sexual, religious,and                emotional references to ecstasy are merged.</p>                         <p><br>               Perhaps it is also the multiple connotations of ecstasy andrelease                that make Pelton&#8217;s Ecstasy, 1928 (fig.3) so intriguing.Not                only does this abstraction represent a natural object,a flower,                which has sexual connotations of alluring beautyand reproductive                forces of its own, but the abstraction alsocontains occult references                with its &#8220;dark hook&#8221; of energeticcraving,<sup>24</sup> its blossoming                release, and its resultantopening to the light of the sun. In the                poem<sup>25</sup>Pelton composed to accompany this abstraction, she alludes               to the multiple meanings of ecstasy. Physical growth, emotional               release, and intellectual aspiration or enlightenment are mixed               with the religious suggestion of ascension to a higher joy.<sup>26</sup>Clearly,                Pelton uses the multiple meanings of &#8220;ecstasy&#8221; tobind                the material and physical world to the spiritual.</p>                         <p><br>             </p>                         <p>It is in her abstraction, Star Gazer, 1929 (fig. 4), thatthe combination                of the physical and spiritual worlds mergemost graphically. Primary                colors and a upward, visual trajectorytoward the star dominate                in this abstraction. The bottom thirdof the painting contains earth-like                images in reds and yellows;the remaining portion consists of a                sky in deepening shadesof cobalt blue, with one bright, six-pointed                orb. At firstglance, the most prominent image is a pale green vase                on apedestal of maroons and pink, centered at the bottom of the               canvas, surrounded by a rolling mass of hills of dark black-brown,               reds, and pale orange. Contained within the vase is a scaled projectile-shaped               object, pointed upward. A yellow glow covers the horizon andlights                the lower portion of the sky. Pelton&#8217;s arrangementof colors,                befitting of landscape, earth and sky, has additionaloccult significance                that appeals, perhaps, on the intuitivelevel to viewers who are                aware of the body&#8217;s color-coded chakras.<sup>27</sup>            </p>                         <p><br>               In Star Gazer, Pelton abstracts both the human figure andthe plant                to create a sense of growth, a new beginning, anotherdawn.<sup>28</sup> This                abstraction projects multiple imagesof creativity. Primarily, the                central object is a plant sproutingfrom the soil, growing toward                the light. However, the projectilewithin the vase might represent                the sexual act, perhaps areferent to a penis penetrating a womb.                The landscape wouldthen become a body and the united act aimed                toward the star,a dual image of ecstasy, physical and spiritual.                In a similarmixture of images, the star shining in the sky could                be theNorth Star, the traveler&#8217;s compass, or the Star of Bethlehem.               It might signify an idea, a heavenly blessing, or a divine presence.               Or, it could simply refer to Venus, the morning star, as Pelton               noted in her journal. As the eye of the night, it could signify               spiritual enlightenment and wisdom, as well as human aspiration.<sup>29</sup>Star Gazer becomes more complex when the sexual interpretation               moves through other levels. In this abstraction, there is a creative               spirit, a sprouting plant, a growth within the universal womb,above                the plane of the earth. In Star Gazer, the physicaland spiritual                ecstasy blend as the destination is the star,a guiding light. </p>                         <p><br>               Pelton&#8217;s compulsion to paint abstractions that conveyed her               spiritual aspiration evolved in the 1920s and continued untilher                death. A selected series of her paintings illumine patternsof images                she developed. Examining the religious underpinningsin these examples                establish Pelton&#8217;s abstractions as personalstatements with                a universal purpose--to bring light to life.In these abstractions                with a spiritual motif, Pelton createdon canvas an upward movement                through space. This sense oftrajectus sursum<sup>30</sup> is spiritual and                physical, earthlyand cosmic, real and hopeful. It is the visible                reflectionof her inner goal, the sharing of which became her purpose.               Taken as a series, the abstractions--Star Gazer, The Guide, Illumination,               Alchemy, Awakening, Voyaging, and Light Center--illumine thesoul&#8217;s                journey as seen through Pelton&#8217;s painted symbols. </p>                         <p><br>               As an overall statement of Pelton&#8217;s spiritual vision, these               abstractions illumine a structured progression, regardlessof their                chronological completion. Like pieces of the puzzleassembled in                different moments of reflection, meditation,and inspiration, these                abstractions are Pelton&#8217;s vision ofimmortality given painted                form.</p>                         <p> <br>               In Pelton&#8217;s design for the spiritual journey, a questioning               exists, at first, a longing for explanation, a gesture towardthe                heavens, a need for response. Star Gazer represents thatpossibility.                Then, mentors, philosophies, and opportunitiesare provided to spark                the individual&#8217;s desire to know. Atthis point in the quest,                the individual looks to The Guidefor direction, discovering that                the true source of power,light, and awareness might exist within                the mind. Suddenly,the spiritual quest, which was once a vague,                unformed longing,becomes a way of life, as evidenced in Illumination.                A mysticalchange occurs as the material of the body and physical                worldbecomes the spiritual in Alchemy. With this, the soul has               a rebirth, an Awakening, and begins its final, upward journey. In               Voyaging the golden bell rings, a signal that an individual&#8217;s               life on earth has prepared the way of the future. In Light Center,               the ultimate realization is simple: the true center of radiance               comes from within. What matters is allowing the spirit toglow outwardly                through its human form, sharing the light withothers. In these                abstractions and others, Pelton offers avisual mapping of the path                toward enlightenment and spiritualecstasy. </p>                         <p><br>               About her last painting, Light Center, (fig. 1) Pelton said,&#8220;Life                is really all light, you know.&#8221; In this abstraction,from its                intensely luminous center disk, a white oval radiatesoutward through                the wavy, lighted &#8220;aura&#8221; to its hazy, glowingedges. The                top of the oval brushes the cloud forms above asit hovers, suspended                in mid-air, over the earth-tone massesbelow. A powerful shaft of                light cuts through the blue skybackground, covering the middle,                vertical third of the canvas.This connecting ray of light illuminates                the cloud edges,encompasses the white oval, and disappears into                the groundbelow. Faint purple plumes, like hands, seem to provide                afloating resting space for the central oval of light. This painting               does not have a separate star. The light source is the oval and               the circle within. </p>                         <p><br>               Pelton&#8217;s concept in this abstraction parallels a passage from               Dane Rudhyar&#8217;s Art as a Release of Power in his series entitled               Seed Ideas. Rudyhar believed every &#8220;organized entity. . .has               a life-center, the heart and soul of the entity. To this center               comes impressions from the outer world. . .from this centerradiate                impulses which cause various types of motion, affectingin some                ways the outer world surrounding the boundaries ofthe organism.&#8221;               In other words, Rudhyar&#8217;s entity is the centerof all impulses,                incoming and outgoing, &#8220;an evolving self,&#8221;the &#8220;All                Form, the one Universal Self&#8221; which exists in the&#8220;Eternal                Now.&#8221; At this ultimate point, time and space do notexist,                and the individual Light Center becomes part of theUniversal Soul.<sup>31</sup> </p>                         <p><br>               By replacing the external guiding light, or star, with a whiteflame                or radiance emerging from a light source within theself, Pelton                confirmed the individual&#8217;s powerful role--tobring light to                life. Obviously, in Pelton&#8217;s view, &#8220;seeingthe light&#8221;               was her spiritual goal, the sunlight her inspiration,a star her                guiding light, and enlightenment--or spiritualecstasy--became her                work in the world.</p>                         <p><font class="second"><a href="shele_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>            </p>                         <p><font class="second"><a href="shele_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>            </p>                         <p>&nbsp; </p>           </td>           <td width="10">&nbsp; </td>         </tr>                 </tbody>             </table>     </td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td valign="top" align="right">&nbsp;</td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td valign="bottom">             <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home">      </a>       </div>     </td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td>     <td colspan="4"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Nancy Strow Sheley<i>.      </i>All Rights Reserved.</font>     </td>   </tr>     </tbody> </table> <br></body></html>
