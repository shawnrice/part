His         knowledge of the subject was enhanced by his relationships with some of         the most prominent Theosophists of the time, including Claude Bragdon         (1866-1947), Nicholas Roerich (1874-1947), and Manly P. Hall (1901-1990).<sup>1</sup>         At the same time he became interested in Dynamic Symmetry, a system of         picture composition based on Euclidean geometry, developed by Jay Hambidge         (1867-1924). Intrigued by the Theosophical axiom that religion and geometry         are integrally related, Bisttram developed an approach to painting--which         he fully explained in his teaching curricula--that brought the two systems         together. When Bisttram settled in Taos, New Mexico, in 1931, he found         a receptive audience for his ideas on Theosophy and spirituality, but         a mixed reaction to Dynamic Symmetry.<sup>2</sup></p>      <p><br>        In 1938, when he proposed the idea of founding what would become the Transcendental         Painting Group (TPG) to his three students, Horace Pierce (1914-58), Florence         Miller (b. 1918), and Robert Gribbroeck (1906-1971), spirituality was         central to his concept. Bisttram brought in the Santa Fe painter and architect         William Lumpkins (1910-2000), who then proposed the idea in Santa Fe.<sup>3</sup>         Bisttram's good friend Raymond Jonson (1891-1982) became the most active         member; his primary contribution was expanding and solidifying the membership,         bringing in the Canadian painter Lawren Harris (1885-1970), the California         painter Agnes Pelton (1881-1961), the New Mexico painter Stuart Walker         (1904-1940), and Dane Rudhyar (1895-1985) and Alfred Morang (1901-1958)         as writers to publicize the TPG. Harris, Pelton, and Rudhyar were all         avowed Theosophists.<sup>4</sup> </p>      <p><br>        Harris was a well-heeled Canadian painter whom Jonson met in Santa Fe         in March 1938, while Harris and his wife were traveling cross-country.         Bisttram and Harris struck up a close friendship at this time, and Harris         took a number of classes on Dynamic Symmetry with Bisttram. Bisttram had         studied with Hambidge in New York in the early 1920s, and Harris, who         like Hambidge was Canadian, was already familiar with Dynamic Symmetry.         Bisttram's spiritual interpretation and application of Hambidge's system         must have been a strong factor in their friendship, especially since Harris         acquired Bisttram's drawing <i>Time Cycle No. 1</i>, n.d. (Fig. 1), one         of Bisttram's more complex uses of the system.<sup>4</sup> While the circumstances         under which Harris acquired this drawing are not exactly known, the spiritual         dimensions of the drawing serve as an example of the type of work that         the TPG members were interested in. </p>      <p><br>        This drawing uses primary geometric forms--circles, equilateral triangles,         squares, and cubes-to express the creative-destructive forces within the         universe, and to depict relationships between time and space as well as         between life and death. Bisttram provides the following interpretation         for this drawing: </p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          <i>Time Cycle No. 1</i> is also one of a series resulting from meditations           on time and space. In this particular drawing the lines of force or           energy permeating space, manifesting out of one source, having passed           through the various organizing centers, take on the geometric shapes           of our world before matter condenses or crystallizes on them. At the           same time the drawing has the suggestion of a pendulum in the shape           of a scythe, a reaper swinging in eternal space.<sup>6</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p><br>        The creative aspect of the forms is expressed by the descending series         of circles, triangles, and squares. This series follows Theosophical theory,         which postulates that creation is a geometrical progression, beginning         with a point. H. P. Blavatsky (1831-91), the most important exponent of         Theosophy in modern times, expressed this idea by citing Pythagorean theory,         one of the foundations of her approach:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          In the Pythagorean Theogony the hierarchies of the heavenly Host and           Gods were numbered and expressed numerically. Pythagoras had studied           Esoteric Science in India; therefore we find his pupils saying &quot;the           monad (the manifested one) is the principle of all things. From the           Monad and the indeterminate Duad (Chaos), numbers; from numbers, Points;           from points, Lines; from lines, Superficies; from superficies, Solids;           from these, solid Bodies, whose elements are four: Fire, Water, Air,           Earth; all of which transmuted (correlated) and totally changed, this           world consists.&quot;--(Diogenes Laerius in Vit. Pythag.)<sup>7</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p> <br>        Bisttram's involvement with Theosophy and Dynamic Symmetry led him to         his interest in Kandinsky's use of geometric form, since it seemed to         him that Kandinsky's book <i>Point and Line to Plane</i> (1926) echoed         this basic Theosophical tenet. By utilizing a scythe in his image, Bisttram         also expresses the idea that death is the complement of creation, and         that the two working together alternately define the cyclic nature of         time. A source for the symbolism of the scythe is found in Max Heindel's         The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception (1909), a book which Bisttram studied         closely.<sup>8</sup> Max Heindel (1865-1919), founder of the Rosicrucian         Society in Oceanside, California, commented on the scythe as follows:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          This is the law that is symbolized in the scythe of the reaper, Death;           the law that says, &quot;whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also           reap.&quot; It is the law of cause and effect, which rules all things           in the three Worlds, in every realm of nature-physical, moral and mental.           Everywhere it works inexorably, adjusting all things, restoring the           equilibrium wherever even the slightest action has brought about a disturbance,           as all action must... The law we are now considering is called the law           of Consequence.<sup>9</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p><br>        Heindel is referring here to the law of karma. Heindel connects the scythe         with the concept of reincarnation by referring to it as a symbol of the         harvest of the permanent atom or Seed-Atom that occurs at the time of         death. This atom becomes the basis for the individual in his next life:       </p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          So man builds and sows until the moment of death arrives. Then the seed-time           and the periods of growth and ripening are past. The harvest time has           come, when the skeleton spectre of Death arrives with his scythe and           hour-glass. That is a good symbol. The skeleton symbolizes the relatively           permanent part of the body. The scythe represents the fact that this           permanent part, which is about to be harvested by the spirit, is the           fruitage of the life now drawing to a close. The hour-glass in his hand           indicates that the hour does not strike until the full course has been           run in harmony with unvarying laws. When that moment arrives a separation           of the vehicles takes place. As his life in the Physical World is ended           for the time being, it is not necessary for man to retain his dense           body. The vital body, which, as we have explained, also belongs to the           Physical World, is withdrawn by way of the head, leaving the dense body           inanimate. The higher vehicles--vital body, desire body and mind--are           seen to leave the dense body with a spiral movement, taking with them           the soul of one dense atom. Not the atom itself, but the forces that           played through it. The results of the experiences passed through in           the dense body during the life just ended have been impressed upon this           particular atom. While all the other atoms of the dense body have been           renewed from time to time, this permanent atom has remained. It has           remained stable, not only through one life, but it has been a part of           every dense body ever used by a particular Ego. It is withdrawn at death           only to reawaken at the dawn of another physical life, to serve again           as the nucleus around which is built the new dense body to be used by           the same Ego. It is therefore called the &quot;Seed-Atom.&quot;<sup>10</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p><br>        While this quote suggests that there is only one Seed-Atom harvested at         the end of a life, later in the text Heindel explains that there are a         number of Seed-Atoms; one, in fact, for each of an individual's vehicles.         What I am suggesting, then, is that the bright spots in the centers of         the major forms of Bisttram's composition depict these Seed-Atoms that         are about to be harvested by the scythe at the end of a life. The ne in         the center of the cube and the one in the center of the triangle are specifically         marked with &quot;tails&quot; of seven lines each. Also, there seems to         be a type of Seed-Atom in the center of the circular form that marks the         handle of the scythe.</p>      <p><br>        This interpretation leads more provocatively, however, to the conclusion         that Bisttram's series of geometrical forms is meant to represent an individual.         This is confirmed in Theosophical theory which conceives of man as a sevenfold         being, diagramed as a triangle supported by a square. Blatvasky, indeed,         diagrams man in just this way. She labels the upper three parts as: 1.         Universal Spirit (Atma); 2. Spiritual Soul (Buddhi); 3. Human Soul, Mind         (Manas); and the lower four as: 4. Animal Soul (Kama-Rupa); 5. Astral         Body (Linga Sarira); 6. Life Essence (Prana); 7. Body (Sthula Sarira).<sup>11</sup></p>      <p><br>        Bisttram's use and placement of the triangle and square and the presence         of seven tails on the Seed-Atoms within the triangle and square would         seem then to refer to Blavatsky's concept of man. Additionally, the moving         scythe seems like it is about to bring the square into alignment underneath         the triangle. This seems to refer to the concept of geometrical alignment         articulated by the Theosophist Alice Bailey (1880-1949) in her book Letters         on Occult Meditation (1922): </p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          The aim of the evolution of man in the three worlds--the physical, emotional           and mental planes--is the alignment of his threefold Personality with           the body egoic, till the one straight line is achieved and the man becomes           the One.Each life that the Personality leads is, at the close, represented           by some geometrical figure, some utilisation of the lines of the cube,           and their demonstration in a form of some kind... The Master is He Who           has blended all the lines of fivefold development first into the three,           and then into the one. The six-pointed star becomes the five-pointed           star, the cube becomes the triangle, and the triangle becomes the one;           whilst the one (at the end of the greater cycle) becomes the point in           the circle of manifestation.<sup>12</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <table width="54" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_2.jpg" width="149" height="237" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="41">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> This chart is labeled               on the top The Seven Planes of Our Solar System and on the bottom               The Constitution of Man</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>In the same book she also discusses Seed-Atoms or permanent atoms, and         provides a chart showing their location (Fig. 2). This chart is labeled         at the top The Seven Planes of Our Solar System and at the bottom The         Constitution of Man.<sup>13</sup> The titles refer to the Theosophical         concept of man as a microcosm of the cosmic macrocosm. In this diagram         she draws a triangle connecting the atmic, buddhic, and mental permanent         atoms. The three angles of the triangle are 40, 110, and 30 degrees respectively.         Measuring the triangle formed by the three permanent atoms in Bisttram's         drawing, we find angles of 30, 120, and 30 degrees, essentially Bailey's         triangle reversed right to left. </p>      <p><br>        According to Bailey, an individual operates, or is &quot;polarised,&quot;         by different permanent atoms at different periods of his life; when an         individual operates at the level of the three higher permanent atoms,         he is &quot;a Master of the Wisdom.&quot;<sup>14</sup> I suggest that         in Time Cycle I, Bisttram is depicting man as the microcosm of the cosmic         macrocosm, as well as man at his most evolved--operating at the highest         possible level at the time of his passing.</p>      <p><br>        Another indication that Bisttram was studying Bailey can be seen in his         use of color, when he later executed this drawing in oils (Fig. 3). In         this same book, Bailey includes a section on color that gives a list of         &quot;the seven streams of colour by which manifestation becomes possible&quot;:         1. Blue, 2. Indigo, 3. Green, 4. Yellow, 5. Orange, 6. Red, 7. Violet.         Bisttram used this color sequence for both of the seven-rayed tails of         the permanent atoms. It is an unusual sequence because the expected order         would be that of the spectrum, with purple on one end and red on the other.         Also, Bailey associates blue, the dominant color of Bisttram's painting,         with the perfected man and the auric envelope through which he manifests,         as well as with the auric egg and the Solar Logos.<sup>15</sup></p>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="87" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="237">        <tr>           <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_3.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_3.jpg" width="190" height="214" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="41">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> Another indication               that Bisttram was studying Bailey can be seen in his use of color,               when he later executed this drawing in oils </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Bisttram's treatment of the square as a cube within a cube also relates         to Claude Bragdon's theory of the fourth dimension. Bisttram knew Bragdon         in New York, and used his books as texts in his classes in Taos. Bragdon,         following Blavatsky, used the circle, equilateral triangle, and square         as the units of creation, explaining that &quot;the circle is the symbol         of the universe; the equilateral triangle, of the higher trinity (atma,         buddhi, manas); and the square, of the lower quaternary of man's sevenfold         nature.&quot;<sup>16</sup></p>      <p><br>        Bragdon based his theory of the fourth dimension on the problem of transforming         the square into the cube as a diagram of the process of redemption. For         Bragdon, the upper portion of a cube is heaven (the fourth dimension)         and the lower portion is the world as we know it. Man the microcosm is         the cube in his ideal (archetypal) form; as man descends into incarnation         from the upper part of the cube to the lower part, he becomes a square.         When descending into incarnation, the square is distorted by the angle         by which it enters, producing the distortions of the individual personality         (Fig. 4).<sup>17</sup> The goal of the individual is to square up his         life and to eventually become the cube. Bragdon diagrams the fourth dimension         as a cube within a cube a metaphor for man the square rolling himself         up, as it were, back into a cube within the larger universal cube.<sup>18</sup>         Bragdon takes this idea from Blavatsky:</p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>          As those Alchemists have it: -- &quot;When the Three and the Four kiss           each other, the Quaternary joins its middle nature with that of the           triangle,&quot; (or Triad, i.e., the face of one of its plane surfaces           becoming the middle face of the other), &quot;and becomes a cube; then           only does it (the cube unfolded) become the vehicle and the number of           Life, the Father-Mother seven.&quot;<sup>19</sup></p>      </blockquote>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="87" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_4.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_4.jpg" width="147" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4</b></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>By using Bragdon's symbol of the cube within the cube, Bisttram injects         the idea of the fourth dimension into his drawing. Additionally, by connecting         the series of squares with the center of one of the circles, Bisttram         describes life as a cycle that emanates from and then returns to the Godhead.</p>      <p><br>        As in all of his works, Bisttram used Hambidge's system of Dynamic Symmetry         in the organization of this drawing. His general approach was to first         do a freehand sketch of his idea, and then afterwards bring the design         into geometrical proportion using Dynamic Symmetry. He began this process         by establishing the major diagonal, which in this case is the handle of         the scythe (Fig. 5, line AB).<sup>20</sup> He then constructed the rectangle         (ABCD) around this diagonal. In this case he then drew another rectangle         of the same size (ADEF) next to it. </p>      <p><br>        The next operation is to divide the rectangles into what Hambidge called         reciprocals, that is, smaller rectangles that are proportional to the         whole. This is done by drawing a diagonal line perpendicular to the major         diagonal, and then drawing in the horizontal. This procedure is repeated         until the rectangle is divided into a series of rectangles that are proportional         to the whole. Each rectangle can be divided into smaller units, and verticals         can be drawn through intersecting points without sacrificing proportionality.</p>      <p><br>      </p>      <table width="144" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td>             <div align="center"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('pasqu_5.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=500')"><img src="pasqu_5.jpg" width="180" height="220" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 5 </b></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Since photographs are inaccurate, and I am working at a smaller scale,         my lines are undoubtedly inaccurate. What is accurate, however, is the         perpendicular relationship between the base lines of the triangles and         the major diagonal. Indeed, this process of coordinating verticals and         horizontals with diagonals using geometric proportion is the means and         aim of Dynamic Symmetry. The principal tension in the drawing is between         the primary diagonal of the handle of the scythe and the horizontals and         verticals of the cube and squares. The relationship between the two is         mediated and resolved by the triangles, whose bases, following the rules         of Dynamic Symmetry, are perpendicular to the primary diagonal.</p>      <p><br>        Hambidge's method sets up proportional areas in rectangles following the         laws of Euclidean geometry. In his system he constructs specific rectangles         that relate to each other geometrically (including the golden section),         and recommends these be used by artists to bring their compositions into         proportion.<sup>21</sup> In this case Bisttram did not use one of Hambidge's         specified rectangles--he made up his own because he wanted a very steep         angle. In fact the angle of the diagonal is about 15 degrees. The shape         in which he set the design, however, is one of the shapes that Hambidge         recommended--two side-by-side vertically oriented root-five rectangles.         The root-five rectangle (2.236+) is more than twice as long as it is wide,         and is longer and narrower, for example, than the golden section rectangle         (1.618+), whose length is a little more than one-and-a-half times its         width. </p>      <p><br>        It is instructive to think about Bisttram's drawing with the central vertical         axis drawn in, showing the two vertical side-by-side root-five rectangles.<sup>22</sup>         This shows that Bisttram oriented his design on the page so that the central         vertical axis would bisect the small circle at the top, and form the left         edge of the cube, adding yet another layer of meaning to the image. Bisttram         may have selected the root-five format, as he did in other works, because         of its cosmic dimensions. The diagonal of the root-five rectangle makes         an angle of 23.5 degrees, the angle of the inclination of the earth's         axis to the pole of the ecliptic. Bisttram, following Hambidge and Plato,         defined beauty as &quot;a matter of functional coordination.&quot; </p>      <p><br>        Bisttram's drawing is executed in pencil with an exacting technique of         very small dots, utilizing negative space that leaves the lines of the         drawing white. He executed some 25 drawings in this style in the late         1930s. I argue in my dissertation that although Bisttram studied Kandinsky's         Point and Line to Plane in the late 1920s when he was developing his Three-Year         Course, a course which he taught with some variations during the entirety         of his teaching career, he did not become acquainted with Kandinsky's         geometrical abstractions until he saw them reproduced in the Guggenheim         catalogues that were published beginning in 1936. While many of Bisttram's         &quot;transcendental&quot; works are influenced by the works in these         catalogues, I propose that the works belonging to this series were done         independently of visual influence from Kandinsky, and represent an original         aesthetic expression.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
