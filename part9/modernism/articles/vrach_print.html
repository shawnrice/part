Morris, Ibram Lassaw, etc.) of abstract artists in America<sup>2</sup>           and between the Parisian Cercle et Carr&eacute;, Abstraction Cr&eacute;ation           and the American Abstract Artists groups in the thirties, should be           recognized.&nbsp; The division between first and second generation American           abstraction is a false one, resulting in the ironic belief that there           was a break in American abstraction between the World Wars.&nbsp; As           evinced by the existence and work of masters such as Xceron,<sup>3</sup>           Arshile Gorky, Raymond Jonson, John Graham and many others, American           abstraction never actually died out but became less popular between           the World Wars.&nbsp; Furthermore, because Xceron's early works are           unknown, he has been characterized by his best known, more familiar           post-1940s style, which has been described as rectilinear, grid-like           or Mondrianesque, another irony.<sup>4</sup> Consequently, Xceron has           been placed within the category of second-generation American abstraction           and his earlier accomplishments have been rendered obscure.&nbsp; However,           a re-examination of the early sources and the recent discovery of Xceron           works from the early 1930s reveals he was continuously creating abstract           works from 1916 to 1932.&nbsp; After this period, Xceron's style became           purely abstract and remained so for the rest of his life.&nbsp; In reviewing           these thorny issues for the purpose of rectifying some commonly held           misconceptions, the author hopes to clarify Xceron's meritorious role           and its context in American art, and to bring about a better understanding           of his painting.</span></p>        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Xceron's           given name was Yiannis Xirocostas.&nbsp; He was born in 1890 in Isary,           Greece, and came to the United States in 1904 at the age of fourteen.           He lived with various relatives across the country until 1911-1912,           when he began studying at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington,           D.C.&nbsp; His surname was eventually changed to Xceron. He was called           John (the English equivalent of Yannis) in America and <i>Jean</i>during           the years he spent in France.&nbsp; In 1913, Xceron and his classmates           Abraham Rattner, Leo Logasa and George Lohr, were deeply affected by           the innovative style of the modern works in the Armory Show.&nbsp; In           the Armory Show's aftermath and after several traveling venues some           works from this show went to Alfred Stieglitz, whose gallery at that           time was one of the few to champion modernism.&nbsp; Xceron and his           colleagues borrowed some of the Armory Show works from Stieglitz to           mount their own version of the show in Washington, D.C.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;           Consequently, Xceron and his cadre earned reputations as revolutionaries           for attempting C&eacute;zannesque interpretations of their subjects           rather than following prescribed academic methods.</span></p>      </div>      <div class=Section3>         <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">After           graduating from the Corcoran, Xceron went to New York to study independently,           and by 1920 was exhibiting with the Society of Independent Artists and           associating with its member artists Joseph Stella, Max Weber, and Abraham           Walkowitz. &nbsp;A representative work of that period is <i>Landscape           #36</i>, 1923, a gouache on board, which is a study after Cezanne that           demonstrates Xceron's expertise with transparent space that would be           recognized as a key characteristic of his mature style.&nbsp; A cottage           in the woods is depicted in passages of brown, green, and neutral shades           and exhibits various figure-ground ambiguities as a result of the interchangeability           of the rectangular strokes. The tree trunks on the right of the composition           are clearly read as foreground whereas the tree shapes on the left appear           to be in the middle ground and to pull towards the back. The flatness           of the cottage and the adjoining trees seemingly growing from its gabled           roof&nbsp; render an ambiguous reading. The overall effect is one of           veils of transparent color as if the forest has been draped with delicate           chiffon material.</span></p>      </div>      <div class=Section4>         <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Xceron           should have been recognized in the scholarly literature as part of this           early American avant-garde, but because his documents, records and early           works had been lost or became otherwise unavailable, he has remained           relatively unknown.&nbsp; More recent scholarship and uncovered sources           of personal archives show that Xceron was familiar with the international           artistic milieu as well.&nbsp; One of these artists was the Uraguyan           Joachin Torres-Garcia, with whom he corresponded after Torres-Garcia           went to Paris in the early twenties.&nbsp; In 1930, when Xceron went           to Paris, Torres-Garcia invited him to join his newly formed group the           <i>Cercle et Carr&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; Kimon Nikolaides, Xceron's Corcoran           colleague who became a well-known Art Students League teacher, invited           Xceron to deliver a lecture on abstraction at the League.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;           Xceron's link to this school is important because several of its members           would have a future impact on the Abstract Expressionists.&nbsp; And,           directly (through the Garland Gallery Exhibition and through his images           in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>) and indirectly (through his connections to           the teachers of the League) so would Xceron.&nbsp; But whereas the latter           has never been studied for his influential role, Graham recently has           been found to be of seminal importance to Arshile Gorky and Willem de           Kooning. </span></p>        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Another           important event in Xceron's life in New York during the twenties was           meeting the Greek Dada poet Theodoros Dorros, who inspired him to break           further with his academic past.&nbsp; Dorros, a mysterious character           in the true sense of the Duchampian Dada spirit, was a Socialist who           wrote Dada poetry, which he published himself so that he could maintain           an independent voice. He was known to present gift copies of his poetry           books to libraries as he did to the New York Public Library in order           to promote his beliefs.<sup>8</sup> He is recognized in Greece as a           Dada forerunner but there is still very little information available           on this Greek poet.<sup>9</sup> Concentrated research has revealed that           while supporting himself as a tailor in the family's fashion business           in New York and its subsidiary in Paris, he wrote both Dada poetry and           socialist literature. Because the Dorros family owned a fashion concern           and had roots in Paris, he was able to help Xceron when the artist arrived           in that city, and introduced him to his sister Mary, whom Xceron married           in 1935.</span></p>      </div>      <div class=Section5>         <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Perceived           as too pragmatic, materialistic and commercial by many artists, the           atmosphere of New York in the twenties became constricting to these           modernists -- some of who sought alternatives in Paris. Xceron and Torres-Garcia           were two such artists seeking a more amenable working climate; less           invested in materialism and more agreeable to artistic concerns.&nbsp;           In 1927, with many letters of introduction including one from Abraham           Rattner who knew the editor of the <i>Herald Tribune</i>, and the help           of the Dorros family, Xceron went to Paris to further his career.&nbsp;           Initially he wrote art reviews as a syndicated art columnist for the           European editions of the <i>Chicago Herald Tribune</i>, <i>BostonEvening           Transcript</i>and <i>New YorkHerald Tribune</i>, newspapers which were           widely read by Americans abroad as well as at home.&nbsp; Therefore,           Xceron's role as disseminator and link between the Parisian and American           avant-gardes actually began as an art critic.&nbsp; He not only reported           on but became acquainted with Julio Gonzalez, Jean Arp, Sophie Teuber           Arp, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Natalie Goncharova, Piet Mondrian, El           Lissitzky, Theo Van Doesburg, Michel Larionov, and Vasily Kandinsky.&nbsp;           He also announced such events as exhibitions, performances, recitals,           and concerts.<sup>10</sup> </span></p>      </div>      <div class=Section6>         <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">Through           the Greek Diaspora in Paris Xceron came in contact with the Christian           Zervos coterie and was introduced to Juan Gris and Efstratios T&egrave;riade.           T&egrave;riade wrote about his work and gave him entr&eacute;e to many           other prestigious circles.<sup>11</sup>&nbsp; By 1928, Xceron exhibited           several abstracted nude studies at the Galerie Dalmau in Barcelona with           friends from Paris including Jean H&eacute;lion and Torres-Garcia.&nbsp;           Xceron's 1931 one-man show at the Galerie de France was so well attended           and successful in its critical reception that it signaled the inception           of Xceron's artistic renown.&nbsp; It was also at this juncture that           Xceron's name and works began appearing regularly in the French press,           especially in <i>L'Intransigeant </i>and Zervos's <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>.&nbsp;           T&egrave;riade, Zervos, Andr&eacute; Salmon and Maurice Raynal, four           of the most important art critics in Paris in the early thirties, wrote           reviews of Xceron's biomorphic works made at this time.&nbsp; Two particular           works, both entitled <i>Peinture</i>, and done in oil on canvas in 1932-1934,           were reproduced in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i><sup>12</sup>&nbsp; Xceron's           biomorphic abstractions and collages were informed not only by natural           processes (as were Jean Arp's <i>concretions</i>) but also contained           the elements of chance and automatist gesture found in Dada.&nbsp; It           should be pointed out here that the earlier experience with the Dada           poet Dorros was seminal in this regard. But, Jean Arp's work also inspired           him and he had reviewed Arp's show in the July 20<sup>th</sup>, 1929           issue of the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i>&nbsp; The importance of Xceron's           biomorphic pieces increases exponentially when considered as typical           examples of his early thirties style, which is Dadaist.&nbsp; It also           serves as proof that Xceron's biomorphic works inspired American artists           such as Arshile Gorky, David Smith, and William Baziotes, who were known           to read the <i>Cahiers d'Art </i>in which Xceron's work was often reproduced<i>.</i>One           seminal figure that brought these publications back to the United States           for other American artists to read was John Graham, with whom many of           the Art Students League circle were acquainted.&nbsp; In fact, Graham           traveled to Paris very often and used Xceron's address to receive his           mail. The proximity of these two artists resulted in a medley of erroneous           conclusions mistaking one John for the other and causing some misattributions.           To complicate things further, Hilla Rebay, then the director of the           Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now known as the Solomon R.Guggenheim           Museum of Art), employed both John (in French <i>Jean</i>) Xceron and           John Graham.&nbsp; Consequently, American critics often confused the           two painters and attributed credit to John Graham for David Smith's           biomorphic or Surrealist influences while a closer inspection of the           documents and a re-examination of dates and facts renders proof that           it was Xceron whom Smith was thanking in his letters for Xceron's influence           and advice.<sup>13</sup>.</span></p>      </div>      <div class=Section7>         <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">An           event of special significance to American artists in 1935 was Xceron's           Garland Gallery exhibition, but the reasons for this success are not           immediately evident until the art and political contexts of New York           in 1935 are scrutinized.<sup>14</sup> Then it is discovered that exhibitions           containing abstract art, such as Xceron's, were rare events and that           American artists were eager to see the latest styles from Paris.&nbsp;           The Depression had taken its toll and the prevalent artistic styles           were figurative, while abstraction was still considered experimental           and unsuitable for expressing political polemic.&nbsp; The brothers           Max and Joseph Felshin, early advocates of abstraction, owned the Garland           Gallery on 57<sup>th</sup> Street.&nbsp; But since the gallery's closing           in the early forties, the Felshins have fallen into obscurity, leaving           us with very little documentation on the history of this space.&nbsp;           In fact, only a careful reconstruction of the events from various archives           rendered proof of&nbsp; which Xceron works were shown at the Garland,           what was their style, and what were some of the names of those who attended           the events.&nbsp; In discovering the Felshin paintings <i>Composition           120</i>, 1934 (Fig. 1) and <i>La Musique</i>, 1933, it is evidenced           that Xceron was working in abstract biomorphism foreshadowing many Americans,           such as Gorky, and that stylistically and chronologically these paintings           are consistent with those of the same period in the Zervos Collection.&nbsp;           However, Xceron's impact on American artists can be found not only in           the numerous interviews and writings by Ilya Bolotowsky, David Smith,           and Borgoyne Diller, but also in comparisons between their works and           his.<sup>15</sup>&nbsp; As an avant-garde exhibition of the latest styles           from Paris, the 1935 Xceron show at the Garland garnered profuse press           reviews. Some of these were very positive and most demonstrated the           contextual proclivity for figurative models of art which, rather than           hindering the reception of Xceron's work, made it all the more appealing           to abstract artists in America.&nbsp; That Xceron also enjoyed some           commercial success at this time is seen by the addition of his works           to Eugene Gallatin's Museum of Living Art, the Museum of Modern Art,           and the Phillips Memorial Collection.&nbsp; In addition, the artist           also held the distinction of being one of the earliest abstractionists           to be offered a position with the WPA/FAP at its inauguration in 1935,           in Washington, D.C.; but rather than accept it, he returned to Paris           for another two years.<sup>16</sup></span></p>      </div>      <span class="second"><br clear=ALL style='page-break-before:auto;mso-break-type:section-break'>      </span>       <div class=Section8>         <table width="149" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="262">          <tr>             <td><span class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('vrach_2.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=700')"><img src="vrach_2.jpg" width="188" height="240" alt="Click for Larger Image" border="0"></a></span></td>          </tr>          <tr valign="top">             <td bgcolor="ffffff" height="18">               <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig 2:<i>                 Collage</i></b><i>.</i> 1932</span></div>            </td>          </tr>        </table>        <p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:0in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in right 6.0in'><span class="second">Remaining           in Paris until 1937, when the increasingly fascist political climate           became intolerable for artists, Xceron returned home to America permanently.&nbsp;           However, during these two years abroad, Xceron continued his activities           with the Parisian avant-garde and the group<i> Abstraction Cr&eacute;ation</i>,           while exhibiting with the <i>Surindependents</i>, <i>Realit&eacute;s           Nouvelles</i>and <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>.&nbsp; Xceron's early Greek rearing           among the classical antiquities in his native town and an education           in classical philosophy, instilled in him the need for synthesis equated           with the ideal; and by 1935 he combined the biomorphic with increasingly           strong compositional order as seen in his <i>Collage</i>of 1932. (Fig.           2)&nbsp; This mixed-media work evinces the increasing focus on space           resulting in linear shapes combined with the previous biomorphic tendency.&nbsp;           The collage medium learned from his study of both Picasso's and Arp's           compositions is adeptly handled and laid upon a simple gray ground.           The oval rust form slightly off left center seemingly floats and is           composed of delicate shades of rust with gridded designs within its           top portion.&nbsp; Surrounding this motif are off-white elements in           biomorphic and linear shapes that have been expertly scratched onto           the surface.&nbsp; This sgraffito was commonly used in Archaic vase           painting but was also a favored method with Picasso who studied Greek           vases at length.&nbsp; Xceron admired Picasso and Julio Gonzalez and           it would be futile to deny his debt to these masters.&nbsp; It is commonly           known that Gonzalez showed Picasso his working methods in welding metal,           and that Picasso created his line works based upon this technology.&nbsp;           Picasso's use of line as seen in his 1928 work <i>Study for </i>Sculpture           (Zervos VII, 206) can be compared to Xceron's <i>Study #73, </i>1932,           which was done in ink and pencil on paper.&nbsp; Both works exhibit           the use of line in alluding to the figure, but whereas Picasso's is           rectilinear, Xceron's line is softer and flowing.&nbsp; In fact, Xceron           had much in common with Picasso, a known Philhellene whose work also           appeared in Zervos' <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>and about whose works T&egrave;riade           wrote for <i>L'Intransigeant. </i></span></p>        <p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;tab-stops:0in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in right 6.0in'><span class="second">When           Xceron returned to the United States, his style was totally abstract,           and is&nbsp; exemplified by <i>Composition</i>, 1937, an oil on canvas           which exhibits resolution and synthesis in his use of form and space.&nbsp;           Space is implied by soft shades of browns, turquoises and pinks that           imply transparency, while the composition as a whole contains both rectilinear           and curvilinear elements.&nbsp; From here forward, Xceron worked with           the elements of his own personally developed abstract language to create           compositions with content and meaning but that appear abstract or non-referential.</span></p>        <table width="43" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="228">          <tr>             <td><span class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('vrach_3.html','','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=600,height=500')"><img src="vrach_3.jpg" width="128" height="216" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></span></td>          </tr>          <tr valign="top">             <td bgcolor="ffffff">               <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig 3:</b><i>                 Composition No. 242,</i><b><i> </i></b>1937</span></div>            </td>          </tr>        </table>        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span class="second">The           year 1937 signified a period of great success for Xceron as numerous           American artists sought his advice.&nbsp; Triumph after triumph followed           as Xceron was patronized by such influential figures as Alfred Barr           Jr., who collected his work for the Museum of Modern Art, Russel C.           Parr and Holger Cahill, whose recommendations to the FAP/PWA resulted           in the Riker's Island mural commission, and Rebay, who as director of           the Museum of Non-Objective Art, employed him to work for the museum           as custodian (the equivalent of a registrar today) of paintings.&nbsp;           Rebay had supported Xceron's studies abroad since 1930, and had bought           several works from his 1937 Nierendorf Gallery show that further promoted           his fame among modern American art audiences.&nbsp; <i>Composition No.           242, </i>1937 (Fig. 3) was one of the works she purchased from the Nierendorf           exhibition for Solomon R.

Rebay had supported him financially, employed           him, promoted his career and deserved his loyalty, but was at ideological           odds with this group.&nbsp; A public debate ensued as the American Abstract           Artists collectively objected to Rebay's "ivory tower" aesthetics stating           that abstract art is part of life: "having basis in living actuality."           <sup>19</sup> The political climate of the United States in the late           thirties and early forties was not sympathetic to abstraction, and pandered           to public opinion informed by the need to express clarity and national           values.&nbsp; Consequently, American abstract artists felt unsupported           by the Museum of Non-Objective Art, whose collection contained works           idiosyncratically defined by Rebay as "non-objective" art, and the Museum           of Modern Art, which owned mostly European works.&nbsp; They also felt           betrayed by the public who preferred figuration.&nbsp; Abstractionists           were criticized for being apolitical or unpatriotic because their styles           were perceived as incapable of expressing political ideology.&nbsp;           Abstract artists objected to Rebay's idiosyncratic use of the term "non-objective"           to define abstract art. <sup>18</sup>&nbsp; An example of the negative           press Rebay received was written by Charles Robbins, who claimed to           represent public sentiment: "As a glance at the examples on this page           will show, non-objective painting to the uninitiated, looks like a cross           between a doodle and a blueprint drawn by a cockeyed draughtsman on           a spree." <sup>19</sup>&nbsp; Difficult as that period was for Xceron           and American abstract artists, and despite his problematic and precarious           political situation, he was an important link between American and European           art when many European artists (such as Leger, Mondrian, and H&eacute;lion)           immigrated to America as Fascism rose in Europe.&nbsp; Many of them           joined the American Abstract Artists.&nbsp; This group was known for           its proclivity towards a rectilinear style inspired by Mondrian who           immigrated to the United States in 1941 and who joined this group.&nbsp;           In the forties, Xceron was also working in a linear style, but not with           pure colors as Mondrian and not in strict geometry.&nbsp; Nevertheless,           American audiences are most familiar with this period of his work, ergo           the assumption that he was a follower of Mondrian.&nbsp; It was to Xceron           that Mondrian first wrote for help when fascist Europe became too dangerous           for artists to stay.&nbsp; In the end, Xceron could not invite Mondrian,           who was aided by Harry Holtzman instead, but they remained friends from           their Paris days in 1928 until the older master's death in 1944.&nbsp;           A typical Xceron composition is an oil on canvas such as <i>Painting           #294</i>of 1946 (Fig. 4), in which the artist's rectilinear preferences           of that era are seen in the grid-like elements both at the top and bottom           left sectors.&nbsp; However, unlike the flat, opaque, coloristic tendencies           in Bolotowsky's or Diller's paintings, Xceron's modulated shades of           plum and lilac fade into the distance to imply transparent space.<br clear=ALL style='page-break-before:auto;mso-break-type:section-break'>          </span></p>      </div>      <div class=Section10>         <table width="181" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="174">          <tr>             <td><span class="second"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('vrach_4.html','PART','scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=450,height=450')"><img src="vrach_4.jpg" width="216" height="180" alt="Click for larger image" border="0"></a></span></td>          </tr>          <tr valign="top">             <td bgcolor="ffffff" height="13">               <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig 4:<i>                 </i></b><i>Painting #294</i><b><i>, </i></b>1946</span></div>            </td>          </tr>        </table>        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span class="second">In           the forties and fifties, Xceron was the custodian of paintings for the           Guggenheim Museum, whose collection was housed at a Manhattan warehouse.&nbsp;

          Most were familiar with Xceron's work through their reproduction in           <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>and the 1935 Garland Gallery show.&nbsp; Xceron           enjoyed many solo exhibitions and was included in most of the Guggenheim           non-objective painting group exhibitions throughout his life.&nbsp;

The detection of the Zervos Dada automatist works           in addition to the Felshin surrealist pieces, along with the recently           found documents, have supported Xceron's position in early American           abstraction, and have proved that American abstraction certainly never           died but rather that its popularity sometimes waned.&nbsp; Xceron created           art in an abstracted style starting in 1916 while at the Corcoran, and           by 1927 he had engaged in automatist drawings and collages, resulting           in total abstraction by 1933-34 in the Zervos and Felshin works.&nbsp;           As such, he is one of the enduring masters of American modern art who           persevered in his engagement with abstraction up to his death in 1967.           </span></p>        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp;</p>      </div>      </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp;
