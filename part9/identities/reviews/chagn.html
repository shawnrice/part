Since its beginning,               the Oxford History of Art Series has provided students and faculty               alike with books that propose an up-to-date and comprehensive treatment               of a wide range of subjects. Barbara Groseclose&#146;s Nineteenth-Century               American Art is no exception to that rule.<br>              <br>              What makes Groseclose&#146;s contribution especially valuable to               students struggling to grasp on an introductory level the main issues               at stake in studying the art of the United States is the clarity               of presentation. While her methodological approach is deeply indebted               to the &#147;new art histories&#148;, from Feminism to Marxism,               she never indulges in the use of jargon or confusing, purely theoretical               terms. In the introduction she offers a straightforward account               of her methodological choices, being always acutely aware of the               impossibility of closure. She is at the same time self-conscious               about her own construction of history and manages to remain always               attentive to the constructedness of the histories on which she draws               (p. 4). This makes for a clear reading, tight and tidy, that can               stimulate both students and teachers. This book avoids a single,               omniscient, authoritative text that surveys frequently deliver.<br>              <br>              I found that the first chapter, &#147;The Profession of the Artist,&#148;               serves as a very useful introduction to the whole problematic laid               out in the book. The ambition is to go further than many more traditional               publications on the subject, which seem to limit the scope of their               inquiries to solving the question: &#147;What is American about               American Art?&#148; Nineteenth-Century American Art offers an account               of painting and sculpture as their aesthetics develop amid political,               social and economic contexts. This makes clear that the whole concept               of &#147;American Art&#148; constantly shifts and re-forms itself,               negating the possibility of an immutable definition of American.               Chapter one is a clear presentation of the state of affairs as the               United States becomes an independent nation, specifically exposing               the condition of being an artist in a country where the development               of an artistic tradition was not seen as a priority and even looked               down upon as rather a suspicious activity. The analysis is well               supported by the use of primary documents, constant throughout the               book, as in this chapter which includes the letters of Kenyon Cox               studying in Paris to his family in Ohio (p. 18). The use of such               documents reminds the students that the discipline of art history               relies on voices from the past, rather than on arbitrary interpretation.               This sets standards of scholarship to be emulated.<br>              <br>              Groseclose&#146;s thematic approach is very useful as many teaching               institutions move away from pure chronology to the development of               an art historical period. However, her choices never feel artificial               and she privileges themes, which have some connection to a more               general historical development. All genres find their rightful place               as they connect to specific historical moments: chapters three and               four cover the transformation of genre painting throughout the nineteenth               century. Democracy is the main focus. How do you represent democratic               ideals? By using examples from popular art such as caricatures and               broadsheets as well as more standard examples of paintings by William               Sidney Mount, Eastman Johnson, and later on in chapter four by George               Caleb Bingham, Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins, she manages to chart               the evolution of the representation of that central concept of American               life. <br>              <br>              Her discussion of portraiture in chapter 2 is exceptionally successful.               She outlines how portraiture was truly the first American art. This               chapter follows closely the construction of the national identity               of the new nation. Through several case studies, allowing for in               depth examinations, she proposes a model of investigation that could               be well applied by students. A good example is the comparison of               Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph Bourgoin&#146;s Family Group in New York               (1808) and Charles Willson Peale&#146;s John Cadwalader Family (1772).               While formal analysis is not her forte, she still manages to raise               the important issue of quality, and to outline clear differences               between various artistic traditions. <br>              <br>              The last three chapters on landscape painting, the American West               and commemorative art are equally useful and come at the right moment               in the unfolding history of the United States. I was impressed by               the use of illustrative materials such as maps, outlining, for instance,               where landscapists painted (p. 118) or the territorial growth of               the United States (p. 160). Once again Groseclose works hard to               present an accurate history, reading the canonical paintings of               Thomas Cole, Frederick Church, George Catlin and Albert Bierstadt               as reminders of a problematic period, paying extreme attention to               the material circumstances of the making of these images, going               beyond the myth, leaving no stone unturned from the depiction of               Native Americans and Christopher Columbus to tourists visiting the               newly created National Parks.<br>              <br>              Groseclose not only discusses the works of prominent figures that               we all expect to find in such a survey, but also pays attention               to recently re-discovered artists such as Harriet Hosmer. She examines               the ways American artists responded to major social and economic               changes resulting from the rapid transformation from an agricultural-based               former colony to an industrialized power with an evolving democracy.               Last, but not least, some of the most interesting and useful features               of the book are a timeline, a comprehensive annotated bibliography               and a suggestion for further readings, neatly organized and easy               to use, as well as a list of art collections and web sites where               one can learn more about the material covered in the book. Overall               this is an innovative and lively examination of nineteenth-century               American Art and its audience, which makes the best possible use               of recent critical approaches and new research.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="chagn_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>               <br>            </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2002 P<i>ART </i>and <b>V&eacute;ronique Chagnon-Burke</b><i>. </i>All Rights       Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
