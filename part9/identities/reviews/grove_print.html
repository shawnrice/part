Mullin begins her study of the &quot;social construction of value         in relation to the patronage of American Indian art in New Mexico from         the early twentieth century to the present day&quot; (p. 3) with a story.         It concerns Amelia and Martha White, wealthy sisters from the East who         moved to Santa Fe in 1923. They are said to have paused there on a cross-country         road trip to have their hair done, and impulsively purchased property         that eventually was bequeathed to the School of American Research, a scholarly         institution. As Mullin points out, the story is really about &quot;common         perceptions of relationships between women and history,&quot; (p. 11)         in which significant historical results achieved by women are perceived         as a consequence of &quot;feminine&quot; whim rather than deliberate intent.         Even more interesting is that the White sisters did indeed settle in Santa         Fe based upon &quot;feminine&quot; motives: those of Bryn Mawr-educated         advocates of women&#146;s rights who were seeking a place other than a         man&#146;s home where they could make a difference. They went in search         of an America where their roles were not pre-scripted, and their quest         for a meaningful personal identity, through their &quot;discovery&quot;         and promotion of New Mexico as a site of authentic national identity,         ultimately helped to redefine Americanness itself.       <p> In addition to offering liberation, the America that the White sisters         were looking for also offered greater &quot;authenticity&quot; than the         rest of the increasingly homogenized, and therefore culturally debased,         nation. Greater tourist travel, made possible by mass production of automobiles         (the very vehicle that took the Whites to New Mexico), had opened many         previously inaccessible areas to the public. However, sophisticated travelers         such as the Whites, or their classmate, journalist Elizabeth Sergeant,         connected the new world to the old by describing Southwestern light as         &quot;Greek&quot; or a village as having &quot;a sort of ascetic pathos         that suggests Palestine&quot; (p. 52). Such allusions to places traditionally         associated with &quot;spiritual inspiration and elite knowledge&quot;         (p. 51) asserted both Sergeant&#146;s cultural authority and the authority         of the Southwest as a source of unique &quot;American&quot; culture &#150;         a claim that was bolstered by archaeological and anthropological investigations         of American Indian civilizations during the 1920s.</p>      <p>American Indians had inhabited for millennia the area that became the         state of New Mexico in 1912, but although they became early subjects of         interest to ethnographers, their creative activities and products began         to achieve wide visibility outside the region only in the early twentieth         century. Eastern artists had been some of the first outsiders to appreciate         the area, among them Edward S. Curtis, who photographed Indians there         in 1903, and painters such as John Sloan, Marsden Hartley, Robert Henri,         and Andrew Dasburg, who had visited or settled in Santa Fe and Taos by         1920. Many of these artists prized Indian art, but ongoing financial support         and the creation of a market for Native artworks became a project of wealthy         newcomers such as the White sisters. Marketing Indian art, as Mullin points         out, &quot;provided a means by which patrons could actively attempt to         influence &#145;the public taste,&#146; expressions of cultural and regional         difference, and ultimately the national identity&quot; (p. 96). The White         sisters and others organized regular, quality-controlled Indian Markets,         complete with (non-Indian) judges and prizes, and even opened a store         that sold Indian arts in New York City. Their aim was not only to encourage         Indian artists and to preserve traditional forms and styles, but also         to promote Indian art as &quot;art, not ethnology&quot; (p.91). Along         with artists such as John Sloan, they were among the organizers of the         Exposition of Indian Tribal Arts that opened at the Grand Central Art         Galleries in 1931, and was hailed as the &quot;first truly American art         exposition&quot; (ibid.).</p>      <p>The Exposition of Indian Tribal Arts marked the first time that Eastern         art critics and viewers had an opportunity to experience Southwestern         art in depth, but it also marked the culmination of a process, begun earlier         in the century, of redefining personal and national identity through the         redefinition of the value of Indian art. It is this process that is naturally         of greater interest to Molly Mullin, who is an anthropologist. She provides         extensive biographical information about individuals, such as the White         sisters, who were involved in the process, and she brings the story into         the present through interviews with survivors and visits to contemporary         Indian Markets. She explicates the assumptions that led outsiders to assume         that they had the authority to judge and market Indian culture, but she         also tests her own assumption that this colonization was inherently unwelcome         as well as her own privileging of some of the White sisters&#146; activities         over others (in an engaging Epilogue called &quot;In the Dog Cemetery&quot;).         This highly readable and informative book thus provides personal as well         as political and theoretical perspectives on important questions of value         and culture in the formation of Americans and concepts of American identity.       </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <blockquote>         <p><br>        </p>      </blockquote>    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
