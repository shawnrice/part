At the same time, one might               question the validity of giving Brown serious critical attention               at this point in time. On the one hand American Painting from the               Armory Show to the Great Depression was a truly pioneering text,               intended to introduce a body of work as much as to argue about it,               and it is a text well over 25 years old now. However, in many ways               Brown still holds his own and remains a standard against which other               texts can be measured and compared, whose very iconic status almost               makes it beyond any critical reproach: Brown&#146;s work is to date               still the foundation of American modern art history, and who wants               to engage in the folly of chipping away at their own foundation?<br>              <br>              A re-reading of American Painting&#133;remains a rewarding experience,               and in some sense that is an unfortunate thing. It is a sad indictment               of American art history that this text is not seen today as a pioneering               investigation of American art from this period, and still one of               the only books to actually consider this aspect of American art               with anything approaching the depth and complexity that it merits.               Rather than being a somewhat staid and conservative period for modern               art as one finds in Europe, on the contrary American visual culture               flourishes during these years despite the cultural factors working               against it. Indeed, as art history and cultural studies continue               to broaden the scope of their inquiries and we factor together contributions               to the fine arts, industrial and architectural design, advertising,               and a wider field thanks to feminist and postmodernist investigations,               we see how vital and rich this period of cultural production was               to America in particular and the century as a whole. Of course very               little of these elements are present in Brown&#146;s own text, but               then again he is quite careful to delimit the boundaries of his               discussion with the very title of the book. By now there should               be much more work built upon, and in direct response to, Brown&#146;s               efforts.<br>              American Painting&#133;, in its very title, is specific as to the               limits of its discussion, and yet it is still a sprawling and expansive               narrative. The book is written as almost an extended essay with               an air of confident authority , one which need not bother with too               many borrowed passages or footnotes. In the right hands this type               of narrative writing can be all too refreshing to read and it also               opens itself up for discussion, debates, and further exploration.               The connective thread for Brown&#146;s ramblings is twofold: politics               and the question of national identity. Unfortunately, the two tend               to confuse each other. At times Brown&#146;s concerns with social               radicalism and the cultural goal of establishing an American art               seem to be equated to the point that even the Regionalists can be               argued to be simultaneously self-consciously American, vitally contemporary,               and socially progressive (if indeed not radical).<br>              <br>              Europe still tends to cast a very large shadow on these proceedings               and the ecole de Paris dominates above all. Brown himself notes               a fanaticism for France among collectors and many Europe-bound artists               in his discussion, but he does not go nearly far enough to redress               this. For all his attempts to appear encyclopedic, there are still               very few women and no artists of color in the book, and certain               essential movements such as New York Dada are underplayed or seem               to be beyond Brown&#146;s grasp, which makes his treatment of artists               like Duchamp, Man Ray, and John Covert a bit convoluted (still,               one cannot help but be grateful to see an artist like Covert mentioned               at all).<br>              <br>              Despite these shortcomings, this is still a very useful and viable               text. Brown weaves more artists names into his narrative than many               20th century specialists will be familiar with; he incorporates               essential passages on related activities such as patronage and artists               publications, including the radical press. To date there has been               no fuller discussion of the American milieu in the postwar period               and the times when his discussion seems too convoluted only helps               to illustrate just how rich and complex this period truly was. In               fact, Brown does himself a disservice when he tries too hard to               fit all this activity into neat, predetermined categories and classifications:               it is apparent by now that one characteristic of early American               modernism is how much it avoids schools and movements that work               so well when discussing European art. Brown has written a book that               still serves as a living text to work from, question, and take issue               with, which by all rights should have long ago been reclassified               as one of the fundamental cornerstones of American modernism: essential               if long since built upon.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p> <font class="second"><a href="angel_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <blockquote>              <p>&nbsp;</p>            </blockquote>            <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and John Angeline<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
