Mullin begins her study of the &quot;social construction               of value in relation to the patronage of American Indian art in               New Mexico from the early twentieth century to the present day&quot;               (p. 3) with a story. It concerns Amelia and Martha White, wealthy               sisters from the East who moved to Santa Fe in 1923. They are said               to have paused there on a cross-country road trip to have their               hair done, and impulsively purchased property that eventually was               bequeathed to the School of American Research, a scholarly institution.               As Mullin points out, the story is really about &quot;common perceptions               of relationships between women and history,&quot; (p. 11) in which               significant historical results achieved by women are perceived as               a consequence of &quot;feminine&quot; whim rather than deliberate               intent. Even more interesting is that the White sisters did indeed               settle in Santa Fe based upon &quot;feminine&quot; motives: those               of Bryn Mawr-educated advocates of women&#146;s rights who were               seeking a place other than a man&#146;s home where they could make               a difference. They went in search of an America where their roles               were not pre-scripted, and their quest for a meaningful personal               identity, through their &quot;discovery&quot; and promotion of New               Mexico as a site of authentic national identity, ultimately helped               to redefine Americanness itself.            <p> In addition to offering liberation, the America that the White               sisters were looking for also offered greater &quot;authenticity&quot;               than the rest of the increasingly homogenized, and therefore culturally               debased, nation. Greater tourist travel, made possible by mass production               of automobiles (the very vehicle that took the Whites to New Mexico),               had opened many previously inaccessible areas to the public. However,               sophisticated travelers such as the Whites, or their classmate,               journalist Elizabeth Sergeant, connected the new world to the old               by describing Southwestern light as &quot;Greek&quot; or a village               as having &quot;a sort of ascetic pathos that suggests Palestine&quot;               (p. 52). Such allusions to places traditionally associated with               &quot;spiritual inspiration and elite knowledge&quot; (p. 51) asserted               both Sergeant&#146;s cultural authority and the authority of the               Southwest as a source of unique &quot;American&quot; culture &#150;               a claim that was bolstered by archaeological and anthropological               investigations of American Indian civilizations during the 1920s.</p>            <p>American Indians had inhabited for millennia the area that became               the state of New Mexico in 1912, but although they became early               subjects of interest to ethnographers, their creative activities               and products began to achieve wide visibility outside the region               only in the early twentieth century. Eastern artists had been some               of the first outsiders to appreciate the area, among them Edward               S. Curtis, who photographed Indians there in 1903, and painters               such as John Sloan, Marsden Hartley, Robert Henri, and Andrew Dasburg,               who had visited or settled in Santa Fe and Taos by 1920. Many of               these artists prized Indian art, but ongoing financial support and               the creation of a market for Native artworks became a project of               wealthy newcomers such as the White sisters. Marketing Indian art,               as Mullin points out, &quot;provided a means by which patrons could               actively attempt to influence &#145;the public taste,&#146; expressions               of cultural and regional difference, and ultimately the national               identity&quot; (p. 96). The White sisters and others organized regular,               quality-controlled Indian Markets, complete with (non-Indian) judges               and prizes, and even opened a store that sold Indian arts in New               York City. Their aim was not only to encourage Indian artists and               to preserve traditional forms and styles, but also to promote Indian               art as &quot;art, not ethnology&quot; (p.91). Along with artists               such as John Sloan, they were among the organizers of the Exposition               of Indian Tribal Arts that opened at the Grand Central Art Galleries               in 1931, and was hailed as the &quot;first truly American art exposition&quot;               (ibid.).</p>            <p>The Exposition of Indian Tribal Arts marked the first time that               Eastern art critics and viewers had an opportunity to experience               Southwestern art in depth, but it also marked the culmination of               a process, begun earlier in the century, of redefining personal               and national identity through the redefinition of the value of Indian               art. It is this process that is naturally of greater interest to               Molly Mullin, who is an anthropologist. She provides extensive biographical               information about individuals, such as the White sisters, who were               involved in the process, and she brings the story into the present               through interviews with survivors and visits to contemporary Indian               Markets. She explicates the assumptions that led outsiders to assume               that they had the authority to judge and market Indian culture,               but she also tests her own assumption that this colonization was               inherently unwelcome as well as her own privileging of some of the               White sisters&#146; activities over others (in an engaging Epilogue               called &quot;In the Dog Cemetery&quot;). This highly readable and               informative book thus provides personal as well as political and               theoretical perspectives on important questions of value and culture               in the formation of Americans and concepts of American identity.             </p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="grove_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font></p>            <blockquote>              <p><br>              </p>            </blockquote>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2002 P<i>ART </i>and Nancy Grove<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
