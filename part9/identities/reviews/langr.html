Before anything can belong               to us, we belong to Nature. Our nervous systems evolved and took               shape through adaptation over thousands of millennia in the enwombing               pulse of Nature&#146;s matter&#148; [16]. And this deeper level               of description and analysis is the method of phenomenology developed               first by 19th century German philosopher Edmund Husserl but also               in America by Pierce and James. Edward Casey says in the book&#146;s               foreword that not only does Wilshire boldly claim &#147;classical               pragmatism is an original and unfettered strain of American thought               but that &#133; it is more original than we have ever allowed ourselves               to imagine. It is original because it is also aboriginal&#148; [ix].<br>              <br>              By &#147;going Native,&#148; American Philosophy might meet &#147;the               greatest challenge to the integrating and involving powers of the               humanities &#133; the ecological crisis&#148;[170].<br>              Without a community of learners concerned about the community of               all communities, Nature, the crisis will certainly be intractable               and all human life and institutions may collapse. As we have seen,               in the deft but broad strokes John Dewey located us better than               most philosophers have in our century: Human cultures are transformations               of Nature wrought by us unusual organisms, but always within Nature               (despite our pretensions to transcend it). Amid the turbulence of               ever-expanding scientific, technological, and commercial advance,               and the evident need to appropriate if we can the ancient Earth               wisdom of indigenous peoples, how can we knowers involve ourselves               so as to better locate ourselves [170-171]?<br>              <br>              Western science needs supplementing because it is just one way of               knowing through which humans make sense of the world&#151;others               are the humanities and arts. Without supplements we are dehumanized.               Wilshire states that the power of Western science and technology               depends on a certain narrowed involvement in Nature. The ability               to disclose hidden forces of Nature and to harness them to satisfy               immediate aims and desires requires that only one aspect of Nature               be considered: what in it is orderable and predictable and quantifiable.               We must then appear to ourselves as those who order, predict, quantify,               manage, control.<br>              <br>              One might think that this scientific venture entails emotional detachment.               But this is only half-true. For the narrower the involvement the               more intense the emotions generated. And effective scientists and               technologists counter this emotional involvement with a desire not               to be duped which is equally intense and narrow. Western science               and technology bore into the world. As Francis Bacon put it famously,               we put Nature on the rack and force her to answer our questions               [16].<br>              <br>              For Wilshire &#147;even when [science is] marvelously revealing               certain sectors of the universe, [its] intercourse with the world               is so narrow and self-involved that the full gamut of emotions and               instinctual adjustments that enliven indigenous peoples&#146; habitual               involvement with the world are masked-out and suppressed.&#148;<br>              <br>              The feeling of belonging to the land and of being cared for by it&#151;cared               for if we are sufficiently aware and skilled, reverent, careful,               fortunate.<br>              For indigenous populations, feelings of being enlarged, enlivened,               and oriented stand and resonate in direct ratio to the breadth and               depth of their care and celebration within the sensuously evident               world. They feel this power that many of us no longer imagine. If               we could, it would drive out mere abstractions, high-flown projects,               as well as paper doubts, as Charles Peirce put it&#151;doubts and               inhibitions that clutter and trip-up our rampaging modern world               [16-17].<br>              <br>              A long quote follows, which I won&#146;t reproduce here, that exemplifies               the unrestrained richly enlarged visionary experience of North American               Holy man Black Elk who heals a young boy by channeling the regenerative               powers of Nature; the boy lived to age thirty. The healing took               place through a shamanic ritual in which the boy felt his connection               to the seven positions: the four points of North, South, East, and               West, the sky above and earth below, and the central place of the               tree of wisdom that originates with the location of each person.<br>              Not until the end of Wilshire&#146;s book do we learn of the personal               meaning of these stories and explorations in the phenomenology of               our body-selves: his daughter Rebekah died in 1997 at age thirty-one.               Wilshire struck with the loss and tragedy of Bekah&#146;s early               death, meditates on her life. His confession made all the strands               of his text display a wondrous pattern of intellectual development.               Though he meant to criticize Western science for its narrowness,               he seems in the end to exemplify how shamanism, phenomenology, and               science cohere in the strange experiences of ghostly appearances               of Wilshire&#146;s beloved daughter to several relatives and friends               after her death. In musing about the possibility and meaning of               these appearances of Bekah he connects the work of mathematician               Roger Penrose and physicist John Bell whose theorem suggests that               two electrons having once shared close proximity will display later               on changes in a mathematical property of spin that coincides with               alterations in the one resonated in changes in the other even when               these electrons are at opposite ends of the universe and there is               no causal connections between them.<br>              <br>              I have long held that thought about one area of intellectual concern               may serve as tools for solving problems in another area. In other               words, concepts in one area may develop patterned relationships               that map onto another level of concepts; experience is aided in               the correspondence of these two levels such that unconscious problem               solving is achieved even though we are not self-consciously attending               to the problems in this other symbolically related area of concern.               In the case of Wilshire, I would argue that his philosophical project               of enlarging Western science by going Native in American philosophy               corresponded to his emotional struggle in dealing with the loss               of his daughter. Freud might put it this way: Wilshire uses his               intellectual project to defensively manage (sublimate) the pain               of the loss of a loved one. But that is too negative. I believe               that all intellectual inquiry must have some emotional salience.               Thus concerns in one area no matter how abstract are related through               emotional valence and vectors with other areas. Perhaps the entire               project of returning us to our embedded and dependent place in Nature               is achieved by the emotional connection and embodied nurturance               derived from things of the earth. Thus, Culture (Dewey&#146;s Experience)               develops from Nature and is ultimately always dependent upon it.<br>              Although Dewey was criticized as a tragic figure especially in the               time period of 1910-1929 Wilshire does indeed return to draw from               him as the first indented quotation reveals. But in setting up the               problematic between phenomenology and science Wilshire contrasts               Dewey with a lesser known philosophy&#151;The Meaning of God in               Human Experience (1912) by William Ernest Hocking. Dewey though               recognized as a central figure in American pragmatism by Wilshire,               serves as whipping post for his appeal to the method of scientific               inquiry in political and moral areas of social life. Wilshire&#146;s               one failing to my mind is his lack of appreciation of the beauty               of Dewey&#146;s bringing us down to earth in arguing for the extension               of experimental inquiry to the realms of social, political, and               moral life. Lesser known figures&#151;Hocking and Henry Bugbee&#151;are               used by Wilshire to usher in the metaphysical talk of Realism, God,               and Spirituality that I would rather do without.<br>              <br>              By entertaining these thinkers and the traditional discourse of               metaphysics, Wilshire doesn&#146;t see that the apparitions of his               daughter might be better understood in neuroscientific ways: The               phenomena of phantom limbs help us understand these appearances.               Loss of an arm is often accompanied by experiences of pain even               though the arm is gone, because our brains have grown or developed               in connection with the arm&#146;s activity. Even though it is physically               gone the connections in our brains are not. One further step is               necessary: our brains are really not separate from other brains               even though our bodies seem to be encased within our own skins.               Our bodies and brains are connected because our patterns of movement               and all of our physical, emotional, cognitive and social changes               are interconnected and interdependent within a world of mutually               developing Experience and Nature. The last three words are in fact               the title of Dewey&#146;s work published in 1925. And it emerged               out of a period of intense body work with F. M. Alexander begun               in 1916. But this is described in Wilshire. For further elaboration               and enlargement of understanding of what it means to be &#147;going               Native&#148; I recommend turning to Wilshire.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>            <p><font class="second"><a href="langr_bio.html">Author's Bio&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <blockquote>              <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>            </blockquote>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Jonathan Lang<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
