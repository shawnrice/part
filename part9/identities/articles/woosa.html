In 2001 Assistant Professor of Public Policy               Studies at Duke University Noah M. Pickus testified before the commission               about the failure of California's integration policies in the early               20th century. According to Pickus, the failure partially stemmed               from the coercive policies of the teens and twenties. Forged in               a national context, Pickus' answer is apt.</p>            <p class="second">However, as a method to teach immigrants their rights               and advocate for them, Americanization developed in California during               these years in a more complex manner than Pickus allows. In 1910               the U.S. census reported that over half of Californians or their               children were immigrants. The state responded to this fact and the               related need to make immigrants feel a part of the American fabric.               In California Americanization was many sided. It opposed disruptive               unionism, but was culturally liberal in many respects. If initially               skeptical about the prospects of incorporating Mexican and Asian               immigrants, it was more inclusive of Southeastern European immigrants               than the tenor of the time encouraged. It was strikingly anti-employer               when employers' actions threatened industrial peace, and unusually               careful in teaching immigrants their rights and duties as well as               teaching native-born Americans their obligations to potential citizens.<sup>1</sup></p>            <p class="second"> While not synonymous with ours, the times likewise               undulated with prosperity and war with its attendant boom followed               by recession and depression. In general a number of external currents               influenced Americanization during the teens and twenties: the Progressive               movement with its faith in reshaping society through state intervention;               World War I and its call for patriotism, one hundred per cent Americanism,               and fear of all things foreign, particularly German; and the Red               Scare, which raised its head with the 1917 Bolshevik victory over               the Russian monarchy, intensifying the fear of foreign influences.               Each of these currents affected California in the realm of Americanization,               although not always in the way dictated in studies of the Progressive               movement or Americanization, which often focus on New York as the               trendsetter in immigrant policy of the time.</p>            <p class="second"><br>              <b>Progressive Influences</b><br>              Among national debates that raged from the 19th into the 20th century               and were reignited in Congress after the assassination of President               McKinley by the son of Southeastern European immigrants was the               question of whether to exclude immigrants and if so, which ones,               based on the racial thinking of the era. A series of reforms enlarged               the categories of immigrants that were excludable. At the same time               other reformers emerged to champion what they called a domestic               immigration policy and what many reformers now refer to as immigrant               policy. This policy argued that the best way to deal with immigrant               unrest was to effectively integrate new comers into American life,               educate them about their rights, and eliminate un-American exploitation               that might lead such immigrants to rebel. This domestic immigration               policy movement was adopted between the teens and twenties in five               states, which contained over half of the country's population of               immigrants and their children. In these states - New York, Illinois,               Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and California - reformers successfully               established agencies that worked to Americanize their residents,               both immigrant and native-born, and to eliminate the exploitation               beneath immigrant unrest. Trailing New York by a few years, California               was the second state to adopt an Americanization policy. Oriented               toward cultural pluralism, it was one of the most respectful of               immigrant differences for the time.<br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="285" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="275">              <tr>                 <td class="second"><a href="woosa_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_2.jpg" width="282" height="214" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     2:</b>Mexican girls from the Garment Workers Union studying                     English from CCIH "Home Teacher Pamphlet".

Lubin, who emphasized the fact that California               was likely to receive an additional influx of Southeastern European               immigrants in 1914 when the Panama Canal opened. Four departments               - an Americanization department focusing on educating immigrants               in civics, a complaint department, a migrant labor camp department,               and a housing department worked together to facilitate immigrant               Americanization. Under Lubin and his fellow commissioners' auspices,               Americanization took on a unique form. Progressing from a harsher,               more racialist view under Amanda Matthews Chase, CCIH programs assumed               a softer tone under Lubin, Christina Krysto, and Ethel Richardson,               even as Americans faced increasing challenges from abroad. </p>            <p class="second">As an organization CCIH perceived Americanization               not as a one way but a two way process in which both immigrants               and their native-born neighbors were expected to learn and act upon               the fundamental principals of citizenship. These principles involved               learning not only one's duties to the nation, but also one's rights;               and actively working to extend those rights to others in order to               reduce destabilizing and costly discontent. While the main beneficiaries               of this program were doubtless intended to be Southeastern Europeans,               and members of the commission left some very unpleasant remarks               about Asian and Mexican Americans on the historical register, both               visual and textual evidence contradicts commonly invoked assumptions               about the state's neglectful attitude towards the integration of               Asian and Mexican American minorities. California's Americanization               program involved all of the above groups and sought to enhance the               efficiency, productivity, and harmony of the state, as well as America's               image abroad. It did so through the influence of a small state bureaucracy               that engaged a broader civil society's voluntary organizations in               the service of encouraging Americans to live up to the principles               upon which the country was founded and teach all immigrants those               principles.</p>            <p> <span class="second"><b>World War I</b><br>              World War I intensified a fear that immigrants from the Axis powers,               Japan or Mexico might foment sabotage in the United States. California,               carved out of Mexico in 1848, shares a border with Mexico. This               together with concern that Germany would aid the Mexican government               retake its lost territories set Southwesterners on edge. In response               to this situation California's CCIH continued advocating a sympathetic               Americanization policy, but combined it with spying on the Industrial               Workers of the World (IWW), which led to a more repressive, yet               not employer-captive policy. <br>              <br>              </span></p>            <table width="253" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="165">              <tr>                 <td height="233" class="second"><a href="woosa_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_3.jpg" width="250" height="208" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     3:</b> An early form of CCIH efforts to link the treatment                     of immigrants to the United State's image abroad, and by extension                     to foreign policy.

CCIH, Annual Report (1923).</a></span></div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">CCIH concern over IWW and a distrust of foreign               laborers, particularly Japanese and Mexicans, is reflected in its               1918 call for the establishment of permanent community labor camps.               CCIH community camp policy appeared only in 1918, a year after American               entry into the war and came under the direct influence of a number               of reports by its investigators. One such report by J.V. Thompson               aroused fear regarding the proposed German, Japanese, and Mexican               alliance. The report called for employer housing to eliminate the               congregation of certain races outside their employer's surveillance               and to limit the mobility of saboteurs. The proximity of Japanese               laborers to some of California's best beet and fruit ranches was               seen as an important threat to California's fruit industry. J.V.               Thompson noted that Japanese and Mexican laborers scattered around               various California counties "constitute[d] a menace...worthy of               observance;" and Mexican cowboys and laborers at the Miller and               Lux Company near Guadalupe, had "roundly cursed" President Woodrow               Wilson when they heard that the United States had recognized the               Carranza faction in Mexico.<sup>2</sup></p>            <p class="second">Thompson suggested eliminating IWW power in a multi-fold               way. He strove to get rid of the organization's headquarters, alleviate               labor camp conditions and prevent the mobility of laborers as well               as easy access to materials for sabotage. He urged employers "to               furnish transportation, and proper accommodations to their employees"               so that they might be kept under constant surveillance.<sup>3</sup>               Additional calls for internment fell on deaf ears. The federal government,               judging internment beyond existing legal avenues, favored a plan               that relied "entirely on legal actions...On September 5, 1917 Justice               Department agents and police officials invaded IWW homes and halls               across the nation and seized everything that they could find." Trials               were held in Fresno and Sacramento, California.<sup>4</sup> The               raids did not stop IWW organizing in agriculture, copper mining,               lumber and other industries, and CCIH sent Thompson to investigate               the Redwood Empire's lumber industry in 1918.<sup>5</sup></p>            <p class="second">CCIH efforts against IWW might suggest that CCIH               was, in fact, captive to industry during the war. Tragically IWW               was one of the few unions that offered a voice for the unskilled               trades in which immigrants tended to congregate. However, it is               important to recognize that CCIH actions during the war were aimed               not against unionism, but violence. As William Preston, the author               of a history critical of the government's repression of IWW during               and immediately after WWI, points out, it is one thing to defend               civil liberties in free speech, another "to accept the continuous               violent action of the IWW's at the point of production."<sup>6</sup>               Like the Progressives, CCIH staff and commissioners distrusted the               organized economic power of corporations. Reflecting these two tendencies,               CCIH called both for the suppression of IWW and the vigilantism               practiced by corporations by placing repression in federal hands</p>            <p class="second"> Beyond rhetoric, visual representations of CCIH               work suggest as much. Its labor camp department actively arrested               labor camp operators, especially as the war years waned and the               incentive for employers to follow CCIH proscriptions decreased.               Inspectors were sent into the field and a complaint department was               established that encouraged immigrant and migrant laborers to take               responsibility for their own living and working conditions ( Figure               1). The commission displayed an openness to sponsoring Americanization               classes under the auspices of any interested organization, including               the Garment Workers Union (Figure 2).</p>            <p> <span class="second"><b>The Red Scare</b><br>              While World War I raised the prospect of German, Japanese and Mexican               saboteurs, events in Russia during 1917 intensified Americans' sense               of vulnerability. That year, the Bolsheviks defeated the czars,               installing the world's first socialist government in one of the               least likely places. Insecure Americans began to see the threat               of Bolshevism in labor strikes and elsewhere. Unscrupulous opponents               of Progressive reform latched onto the general fear of the American               public as a way to attack social reforms, often successfully, parading               their destruction of Progressive policies as the triumph of Americanism.               Proponents of one type of Americanism (progressive, pluralistic)               battled it out with proponents of another (conservative, intensely               nationalistic, and committed to molding all into one culture). In               this combination of World War I and Red Scare-induced battles, CCIH,               like many other Progressive era agencies and reforms, was accused               of communist sympathies as illustrated in the election campaign               of California Governor Friend W. Richardson and the allegations               of the Better America Federation.<br>              <br>              </span></p>            <table width="152" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="265">              <tr>                 <td height="233" class="second"><a href="woosa_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_4.jpg" width="201" height="257" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     4:</b> "Americans!"

Equally symptomatic of the backlash, but more induced               by the Red Scare, was the establishment of the Better America Federation               (BAF) in May 1920. As Edwin Layton shows, this reactionary organization               assaulted Progressive legislation - from higher taxes on banks and               utilities to the open shop to the eradication of all state regulatory               boards and commissions including CCIH. BAF accused its opponents               of treason and subversion, and specifically targeted Commissioner               and founder, Simon Lubin, and labor leader and Commissioner Paul               Scharrenberg. Meanwhile, the realignment of political parties in               California touted a business ideology that emphasized corporate               organization and efficiency as opposed to the social agencies' agendas.               This new administrative conservatism became institutionalized by               the 1923 election of Richardson as California's governor.<sup>7</sup></p>            <p class="second">BAF represents one of the earliest external challenges               to CCIH. As Edwin Layton notes, BAF campaigned to destroy many of               the Progressives' achievements using the same methods that Americanizers               employed during the war.<sup>8</sup> Although CCIH ultimately discredited               BAF by exposing its private utility interest background, Lubin and               Scharrenberg were damaged by the assaults.<sup>9</sup>The militant               nationalism of World War I and the Red Scare encouraged BAF to use               Americanization rhetoric to discredit its opponents.<sup>10</sup>               For example, BAF accused Lubin and the commission of assisting the               IWW <sup>11</sup>. It attacked Scharrenberg for drawing money from               CCIH while lobbying for anti-injunction bills that increased labor               unions' power in strikes.<sup>12</sup> These attacks came at a vulnerable               moment in CCIH history.</p>            <p class="second">Influenced by the Red Scare and the tarring of CCIH               with the taint of Communism, CCIH and the State Board of Education,               whose main Americanization program developer had been trained in               CCIH, took the offensive, promoting the need for Americanization               programs for immigrants and their extension to native-born Americans               throughout California. Indeed, in this volatile climate, CCIH actually               moved considerably to the left of Liberal Americanizers. Its proactive               approach to the challenges posed by the Red Scare was evident as               early as 1919. In 1919 and 1920, a series of articles entitled "The               Strength of the Nation" co-authored by commissioner Lubin and staff               member Christina Krysto appeared in The Survey.<sup>13</sup> These               articles refuted the contemporary feeling that the melting pot was               not working, called for a federal department of nation building               with bureaus for the Americanization of both foreign-born and native-born               citizens, and reaffirmed CCIH belief that America's strength derived               from its power to take the talents of immigrants and "while preserving               their national core, to transmute them into a new thing that is               essentially American."<sup>14</sup></p>            <p class="second">These articles placed novel emphasis on how the               treatment of immigrants influenced America's international image.               Americans were told that "when one section of the population is               a ready victim to exploitation, the moral tone of the whole land               is lowered."<sup>15</sup> They were warned that the returned immigrant               became an example of American life to the homeland. "Returned emigrants               corrupted by the country they have visited, weakened by excessive               labor, impoverished by adverse industrial conditions, embittered               by a series of failures," would be "a burden to the home community               and a menace to the entire homeland"<sup>16</sup>, hardly likely               to project a good image of America (Figure 3).</p>            <p class="second">CCIH 1921 Annual Report argued "that Americanization               was not flag-raising and 'patriotic' howling; it was not suppression               of speech and honest opinion; it was more than teaching English               to foreigners" and involved the "Americanization" of Americans,               developing national ideals and standards in which "all residents,               foreign-born as well as native-born" would be schooled, especially               through community participation.<sup>17</sup> CCIH launched a community               organization campaign in 1920 and 1921 insisting that Americans               should "be [their] own Americanizers"!<sup>18</sup> Two posters               that appeared in its Bulletin clearly conveyed to social workers               and readers in general that instead of complaining about immigrants               as radical, unassimilated elements Americans ought to offer their               services to the state to solve the so-called problem (Figure 4).               Americanization was equated with raising all residents (whether               foreign or native-born) to a certain standard of living.</p>            <p class="second">After World War I, CCIH continued to emphasize its               belief that immigrant cultures provided the best materials out of               which to build citizens. Moreover, while California's conservatives               won the immediate election, they lost the long-term battle. The               slashing of CCIH budgets by Governor Richardson was quickly reversed               when the governor became inundated by testimony about CCIH benefits               to the state from women's clubs, employers, and immigrant leaders.</p>            <p class="second">Surely, in California during the teens and twenties,               Americanization was not about one hundred per cent Anglo-conformity               or teaching immigrants to accept a status quo that endangered the               industrial safety, health, and well-being of individuals and the               community at large. CCIH opposition to total Americanism influenced               the State Department of Education, which assumed responsibility               for immigrant education in 1920, along with its branch, the Bureau               of Immigrant Education (BIE) in California's Department of Adult               Education. The fact that Ethel Richardson, former Director of CCIH               Bureau of Immigrant Education served on all three of these bodies,               makes clear why this occurred.<sup>19</sup> During the late 1920s,               BIE, which furnished the most material used in immigrant education               throughout the state, resisted demands for immigrant conformity.<sup>20</sup>               A 1925 BIE Community Exchange Bulletin proclaims that the "purpose               of the home teacher...is not to encourage the alien to forget his               native culture."<sup>21</sup> <br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="338" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="281">              <tr>                 <td height="233" class="second"><a href="woosa_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_5.jpg" width="335" height="216" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="2">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig                     5:</b> A class of Japanese immigrant mothers organized by                     a Home Teacher in Los Angeles.

Those who experienced Americanization during that               era, particularly Mexican Americans, remember Americanization in               a harsher mode. Asian Americans, particularly Japanese Americans,               then subject to exclusion, found themselves subject to greater inclusion               at the same time.<sup>22</sup> The decline in immigration and rise               in native-born children who were automatically American citizens               intensified the need to educate Asian immigrants, even though they               were denied the opportunity to naturalize. CCIH classes involving               Japanese Americans suggest this shift (Figure 5).</p>            <p class="second">The advent of World War II and a bifurcated policy               that incarcerated Japanese Americans while embracing Chinese and               Filipino Americans starkly interrupted CCIH activity. Americanization               ultimately disappeared as a state policy in 1945, when CCIH immigrant               protective functions were abolished. Some fifty years later the               Little Hoover Commission reinvestigates this complex precedent as               one of a number of policies that might facilitate immigrant integration               in California for mutual benefit. </p>            <p class="second"><font class="second"><a href="woosa_notes.html">Notes&gt;&gt;</a></font>             </p>            <p>&nbsp; </p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Anne Woo-Sam<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
