Despite the clarity of Emerson&#146;s               call, he himself was extremely conscious of European thinking, frequently               borrowing images from European models in his writing. He was hardly               able to keep himself from reflecting European intellectual history               from his position in a place that was still trying to define itself               as a nation, let alone as one possessing a cultural identity. It               is perhaps more accurate to suggest, however, that Emerson refracted               European thinking: he opened it up to new possibilities of understanding.</p>            <p><br>              The early-twentieth-century American composer Charles Ives (1874-1954)               provides a sort of answer to Emerson&#146;s call for &#147;The American               Scholar,&#148; in the guise of what we might call &#147;The American               Composer.&#148; The impact of Emerson on Ives&#146;s thinking cannot               be overestimated. It is concretely demonstrated in the opening movement,               entitled &#147;Emerson,&#148; of Ives&#146;s Piano Sonata No. 2,               &#147;Concord, Mass., 1840-60,&#148; and the essay on Emerson included               in Ives&#146;s Essays Before A Sonata, a collection of prose works,               all quite Emersonian in style, written to resonate against the music.               The sonata is in four movements, each named after a Transcendentalist               writer: &#147;Emerson,&#148; &#147;Hawthorne,&#148; &#147;The Alcotts,&#148;               and &#147;Thoreau.&#148; While having remained in America for his               musical training, Ives was grounded in the European Romantic tradition,               through the Beethoven-centric guidance of his teachers. His musical               output, however, refracts that tradition, hearing possibilities               in the music of his forebears that they never could have imagined               themselves.</p>            <p><br>              My intention here is to comment briefly upon Emerson&#146;s and               Ives&#146;s responses to their inherited European traditions. I               shall pay particular attention to their appropriation of models               expressing an organic approach to the writing of history and the               composition of music, respectively. Two deeply related themes underlie               this investigation: First, the effect that the rupture between Europe               and the New World had upon an understanding of nature and one&#146;s               place in the natural world, and second, the effect that this rupture               had upon an American understanding of history&#151;and, by extension,               upon any possible sense of cultural continuity with the Old World.</p>            <p><b>EMERSON AND HISTORY</b></p>            <blockquote>              <p>There is one mind common to all individual men &#133; Of the                 works of this mind history is the record. <sup>2</sup></p>            </blockquote>            <p>These lines are taken from the opening of the first essay of the               First Series of Emerson&#146;s essays, &#147;History,&#148; first               published in 1841. In it, Emerson proposes an entirely organic understanding               of human being and, by extension, of human history. Emerson&#146;s               model for this view is found in his understanding of the behavior               of the natural world:<br>              The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece,               Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man.               Epoch after epoch, camp, kingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are               merely the application of this manifold spirit to the manifold world.               <sup>3</sup><p>              Emerson hardly invented such a notion, which in its vision of an               overarching unity guiding a diverse world evokes Plato, and in its               employment of metaphors describing such part-to-whole relations               in terms of botanical growth recalls Johann Wolfgang Goethe&#146;s               notion of the Urpfl&auml;nze, the &#147;primal plant&#148; from               which Goethe hypothesized all other plant forms could be derived.<sup>4</sup>               Indeed, Goethe extended this notion to a range of natural phenomena,               positing an array of Urph&auml;nomene. According to Goethe, the               full range of discrete objects observed in nature, in all their               diversity, could be related back to such Urph&auml;nomene. Furthermore,               each natural object could be shown to demonstrate its own internal               coherence&#151;in the case of the plant, for example, such that               each part can be viewed in terms of a transformation or metamorphosis               through the leaf-form&#151;which is ultimately reflective of the               order of the universe as a whole. Goethe is the subject of the last               of Emerson&#146;s collection of essays entitled Representative Men.<sup>5</sup>             </p>            <p>&#147;Goethe; or, the Writer&#148; is a substantial record of the               influence of Goethe on Emerson&#146;s thinking. By casting Goethe               as &#147;the writer,&#148; Emerson suggests something of his direct               kinship with this figure. It would serve neither Emerson nor Goethe,               it seems, to be described as merely a philosopher, a mystic, a skeptic,               a poet, or a man of the world, the monikers he uses for his other               &#147;representative men&#148;. The function of a writer&#151;through               whose eyes &#147;a man is the faculty of reporting, and the universe               is the possibility of being reported&#148;&#151;seems to be more               encompassing. It suggests the function of what we might call a historian,               &#147;who see[s] connection where the multitude see fragments, and               who are impelled to exhibit the facts in order, and so to supply               the axis on which the frame of things turns.&#148;<sup>6</sup> This               person who is able to make connections among fragments, who can               construct a narrative from an array of facts, is in fact engaged               in the process of writing history. Emerson and Goethe emerge here               as writer-historians of a similar stripe not only by virtue of the               breadth of their concerns but by their concern with nature in particular.<p>              In what might be viewed as a circular relation to the evocation               of Goethe&#146;s organic model that opens &#147;History,&#148; Emerson               opens &#147;Goethe; or, the Writer&#148; by declaring his understanding               of history through nature: &#147;Nature will be reported. All things               are engaged in writing their history.&#148;<sup>7</sup> The influence               of Goethe on Emerson, who wrote that Goethe &#147;has said the best               things about nature that ever were said,&#148; is clear.<sup>8</sup>               Emerson, however, does not simply mirror Goethe. Emerson and Goethe               are not only separated by time, but by considerable physical space.               This distance must be calculated not only in terms of miles, but               in terms of culture and language; furthermore, the distance must               be appreciated in terms of the &#147;nature&#148; to which each               of them is responding.<p>              Goethe&#146;s inspiration for the Urpfl&auml;nze occurred during               his travels in Italy, which began in 1786. Confronted by a bewildering               array of unfamiliar vegetation in Italy, Goethe was led to make               detailed notes and drawings documenting his observations. The Urpfl&auml;nze               occurred to him in a flash of intuition during his meditation upon               these observations. I would like to suggest that while Goethe&#146;s               trip to Italy was no doubt eye-opening, exposing him to varieties               of plants that he had never seen before, he was essentially crossing               from one civilized European country to another; his adventure was               most closely akin to a holiday. The difference between Goethe&#146;s               excursion and the American experience lies in the circumstances               surrounding the early American settlers&#146; crossing of the Atlantic               Ocean; in the passage from an essentially civilized environment               to a truly alien and dangerous wilderness.<sup>9</sup> Emerson was               writing well into the process of the conquest of that wilderness               and its indigenous peoples, but vestiges of that encounter with               a variety of nature quite unlike the tame European landscape&#151;and               with human beings quite unlike other Europeans&#151;manifest themselves               in Emerson&#146;s thorny syntax. Emerson&#146;s relation to nature               resonates not merely in terms of Goethe&#146;s profound curiosity,               his serious contemplation of natural phenomena, but as a matter               of considerable urgency. For Emerson&#146;s immediate American ancestors,               learning to understand, describe, and move about in the natural               environment was a matter of life and death; this encounter with               the wilderness is our history. European models of thinking necessarily               resonate differently when they are imported to America.<p>              Furthermore, in a place without an established intellectual or cultural               tradition, one finds fertile ground for the reinterpretation of               European thinking, and its refraction into a range of meanings.               This is suggested in the multiplicity of views that Emerson embraces               in &#147;History&#148;. &#147;A man is the whole encyclopedia of               facts,&#148; he wrote. &#147;If the whole of history is in one man,               it is all to be explained from individual experience. There is a               relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time.&#148;               <sup>10</sup> An extension of the application of the part-to-whole               relationships that so captured Goethe&#146;s imagination, this view               that the history of the world is played out microcosmically in each               individual lifetime is perhaps possible only in a country founded               on principles of individual liberty, principles designed to recognize               the intrinsic value of each person, while at the same time recognizing               the importance of their contributions to the larger social body.<p>              Emerson&#146;s view of history, then, becomes a radically subjective               one. He imagines that each of us has our own dialogic relation with               history, thus rejecting a static sense of its past-ness and seeking               instead to reanimate it in each individual&#146;s present:<p>              When a thought of Plato becomes a thought to me,--when a truth that               fired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no more. When I feel               that we two meet in a perception, that our two souls are tinged               with the same hue, and do, as it were, run into one, why should               I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count Egyptian years?               <sup>11</sup><p>              In this way, Emerson can be said to presage the ideal of Hans-Georg               Gadamer&#146;s Horizontverschmelzung, in which the horizon of the               historical object and the horizon of the observer of the historical               object fuse into a relation of understanding.<sup>12</sup> In such               a state, &#147;History no longer shall be a dull book. It shall               walk incarnate in every just and wise man.&#148;<sup>13</sup></p>            <p><b>IVES AND HISTORY</b><br>              In the history of this youthful world, the best product that human               beings can boast of is probably Beethoven; but, maybe, even his               art is as nothing in comparison with the future product of some               coal-miner&#146;s soul in the forty-first century.<sup>14</sup><p>              Much as Emerson engaged the ideas of his precursor, Goethe, so did               Ives engage those of the German musical master Ludwig van Beethoven.               This is made clear in Ives&#146;s writings and also in his music.               Geoffrey Block notes that Ives &#147;borrowed&#148; musical material               from Beethoven more often than he did from any other classical composer.              <sup>15</sup> The engagement with Beethoven is especially evident in the Concord               Sonata, which is, in essence, a sixty-minute trope on the familiar               four-note motive (&#147;bum-bum-bum-BUM&#148;) that opens Beethoven&#146;s               Fifth Symphony (hereafter, &#147;the Beethoven motive&#148;).            <p>&nbsp;             <table width="124" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="65">              <tr>                 <td><img src="bruhn_1.jpg" width="432" height="48" border="0"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 1:</b> Ives&#146;s                     &#145;human faith melody&#146;, with Beethoven motive indicated</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>                        <p>Something of the organic understanding of history expressed in               Emerson, by way of Goethe, is articulated in the growth of organic               musical structures in Ives&#146;s music, by way of Beethoven. Rather               like Emerson&#146;s writer-historian, who is able to make connections               among fragments, Ives composed music through a process that J. Peter               Burkholder has called &#147;cumulative form&#148;.<sup>16</sup>               This process, which has much in common with the &#147;organic&#148;               growth of themes in Beethoven from small musical &#147;cells,&#148;<sup>17</sup>               is a variation on standard sonata form. Sonata form typically describes               a single movement of a work, in which themes are stated in an &#147;exposition&#148;               section, then disassembled and reworked in a &#147;development&#148;               section, then restated in their reconstituted form in a &#147;recapitulation&#148;               section. In &#147;cumulative form&#148;, Ives begins with fragmentary               motives in a process of development and moves toward the clear articulation               of a main theme. In the Concord Sonata, this process is expanded               to unfold over multiple movements, such that the entire sonata becomes               the dramatization of a single theme. Ives called this theme, shown               in Figure 1, the &#147;human faith melody&#148;.<sup>18</sup> This               melody is not heard clearly and completely until the third movement               of the sonata, &#147;The Alcotts&#148;, although it appears in fragmented               form, buried within the dense textures of &#147;Emerson&#148; and               &#147;Hawthorne&#148;. The theme returns as a kind of echo in &#147;Thoreau&#148;,               played by a solo flute, wafting out over an imagined Walden Pond.             <p>              It is important to notice that the Beethoven motive is embedded               within Ives&#146;s &#147;human faith melody.&#148; By growing the               Beethoven motive into a melody of his own creation, Ives is not               merely reflecting but refracting his understanding of Beethoven,               hearing new possibilities in a familiar European musical gesture.               Ives wrote:<p>              I remember feeling towards Beethoven [that he&#146;s] a great man&#151;but               Oh for just one big strong chord not tied to any key &#133; The               more the ears have learned to hear, use and love sounds that Beethoven               didn&#146;t have, the more the lack of them is sensed naturally.               <sup>19</sup>            <p>&nbsp;             <table width="124" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="65">              <tr>                 <td><img src="bruhn_2.jpg" width="389" height="89"></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 1:</b> First page of                     &#145;Emerson&#146;, with Beethoven motives indicated&#148;;                     source: Charles Ives, Piano Sonata No. 2, &#147;Concord, Mass.,                     1840-1860,&#148; second edition ([New York]: Associated Music                     Publishers, 1947</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p>Throughout the Concord Sonata, the listener hears the Beethoven               motive in numerous octave registers, dynamic ranges, rhythmic diminutions               and augmentations, and harmonic contexts, including the kinds of               dissonances &#147;not tied to any key&#148; that Ives imagined.               Such troping on the Beethoven motive is already apparent on the               first page of &#147;Emerson&#148;, as shown in Figure 2. In this               way, Geoffrey Block suggests that in the Concord Sonata Ives was               writing the music that, to his hears, &#147;Beethoven would have               composed had he been composing in 1915 rather than 1815.&#148;<sup>20</sup>               With Emerson as his spiritual ancestor, Ives is dragging Beethoven               to the New World and into the future.             <p>              The larger point to be made here concerns Ives&#146;s acute awareness               of his place in the Western musical tradition, and in relation to               a Eurocentric musical tradition in particular. Ives reveals himself               as conscious of Beethoven&#146;s iconic status in the history of               Western music, but also as a believer in continued progress through               time&#151;and in himself as part of that progress beyond Beethoven.               Ives was unique among American composers of his generation for eschewing               the lure of Europe, remaining in America for his musical education.               His teacher at Yale, Horatio Parker, had received his musical training               in Germany and passed elements of that tradition down to his student.               Burkholder traces the manifestation of traits inherited from the               German Romantic tradition in Ives&#146;s music. These include Ives&#146;s               use of European musical genres, such as symphony, sonata, and art               song; his awareness of a musical canon that contains masterworks               with which his own compositions must compete; his use of musical               quotations from and allusions to other works; his interest in program               music, and his use of literary, philosophical, and spiritual subjects               in that music; the inclusion of apparently autobiographical instances               in his music; the search for new means of expression while continuing               to use traditional forms; and a spirit of nationalism. As radical               as Ives&#146;s music seems on the surface, Burkholder suggests,               his &#147;challenge is always from within the [European] tradition,               not from outside it.&#148;<sup>21</sup><p>              If Parker passed the German tradition down to his student, however,               it must be understood as a German tradition passed through an American               filter. Parker had also studied with the American composer George               Chadwick, and encouraged Ives&#146;s interest in Transcendentalism.               As much as Ives worked within the European tradition, his highly               idiosyncratic musical vocabulary must be understood as the product               of an inter-cultural disjuncture between European aesthetic values               and the various vernacular American musics with which Ives was also               intimately familiar, and which made their way into the Concord Sonata.               American patriotic songs, church music, ragtime music, and early               jazz were part of Ives&#146;s direct musical experience,<sup>22</sup> resonating               in his inner ear alongside&#151;and mixed with&#151;European art               music. As a result, in the Concord Sonata, Ives creates a context,               a musical environment, in which the Beethoven motive, pulled from               its European roots, must be heard anew, transplanted to American               soil, finally grown into his &#147;human faith melody&#148;.<p>              Ives&#146;s sense of his musical environment, compared with that               of Beethoven, is analogous to the difference between Emerson&#146;s               and Goethe&#146;s understanding of nature. Beethoven&#146;s music               can be refracted into a wide range of meanings for a composer positioned               in the musical wilderness of early-twentieth-century America, with               its blurry intermingling of cultivated and vernacular,<sup>23</sup> European               and African influences. Like Emerson&#146;s subjective view of history,               his call for the reanimation of the past in the present, Ives&#146;s               juxtaposition of Beethoven against American vernacular music, his               endless troping of the Beethoven motive in the Concord Sonata, gives               rise to a musical environment in which the Beethoven motive is given               the freedom to resound anew. In this way, Ives sought to create               a world in which musical &#147;history no longer shall be a dull               book,&#148; and new possibilities for interpreting the European               tradition are given voice in America.</p>            <p><a href="bruhn_notes.html">Notes<font class="second">&gt;&gt;</font>               </a></p>            <p><a href="bruhn_bio.html">Author's Bio<font class="second">&gt;&gt;</font>               </a></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>          <td width="20">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Christoper Bruhn<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font>     </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
