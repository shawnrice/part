Politically, economically, intellectually         and culturally, the country was moving from the Gilded Age into the Progressive         Era. Governmental reforms, new avenues of trade, and new attitudes about         science and history began to appear; yet older attitudes of isolation,         conservatism and sentimentality remained in force. This set of contradictions,         symptomatic of a process of national redefinition, found expression in         the exposition in a number of ways.</p>      <p> The stated purpose of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition was         to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal and the official theme was         the global peace and harmony the country hoped such a tremendous engineering         feat would foster.<sup>1</sup> After France failed in the task, the United         States undertook the project in 1904;<sup>2</sup> advances in medicine         and technology enabled completion by 1914. President Theodore Roosevelt         believed the canal to be a critical milestone in the nation&#146;s continuing         move toward imperialism because it would grant controlling access to both         the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. </p>      <p> The history of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition is intricately         linked to both the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era. According to the         philosopher George Santayana, the Gilded Age, the period between roughly         1876 and 1915, exhibited a number of contrasts.<sup>3</sup> Old versus         new, conservatism versus radicalism are some of the broader outlines of         the conflicts that Santayana observed towards the end of the nineteenth         century. Much of the conservatism of the Gilded Age was aimed at the products         of the country&#146;s increasing industrialization. As more consumer goods         were mass-produced, such goods looked more like familiar hand-made objects,         indicating a shift from imitation and illusion to authenticity within         the arts and material culture. During the late nineteenth century there         was a taste for lifelike imitations; among the best examples were the         Court of Honor at the World&#146;s Columbian Exposition with its perfect         imitations of French Beaux-Arts architecture, and the Midway at Coney         Island, with its reproductions of exotic, baroque and rococo architecture.         The world inside these spaces offered the illusion of mastery and comprehension,         allowing the older generation to deal with the rapid changes occurring         within American society.</p>      <p> The Progressive Era is likewise noted for contrasting ideas, such as         &#147;feminine&#148; versus &#147;masculine&#148;; refinement versus strength;         old versus new. Progressive Era reformers recognized these contrasts and         stressed &#147;progress&#148; in all its manifestations. They attempted         to bring order to politics, industry and cities during a period of ever-increasing         transformation from a rural to an urban and industrialized economy. Between         1900 and 1920 the United States was rapidly industrializing and becoming         increasingly dependent on immigrant labor. Politically and economically         it could no longer continue the traditional foreign policy of isolation.         The government began to rely on the stability of Europe, Asia and Latin         America in order to protect its own economy as U.S. companies began building         factories abroad. In addition advances in communication and transportation         drew the world more closely together. The balance of international power         shifted due to the rise of Germany as Europe&#146;s leading military power,         and of Japan in Asia.<sup>4</sup> A foreign policy was required that recognized         the imperialist desires of new players on the world political scene, and         the construction of the Panama Canal and the security it would provide         to American trade routes was one of the actions taken to secure the country&#146;s         role in this world order.</p>      <p> Santayana&#146;s view of the cultural situation of the United States         in 1911 perfectly describes the competing visions expressed at the Panama-Pacific         fair. Past expositions, beginning with the 1893 World&#146;s Columbian         Exposition, were, in effect, paradigms of the Gilded Age. They followed         existing rules, were very conservative in design and execution, and reflected         the correctness and &#147;politeness&#148; of their creators. The Panama-Pacific         International Exposition mirrored the contrasts of both the waning Gilded         Age and the developing Progressive Era, and attempted in theme, purpose,         and design to reconcile and highlight these contrasts. The fair took place         in San Francisco in the &#147;masculine&#148; West; artists associated         with the eastern &#147;feminine&#148; establishment conceived the decorations.         The fair expressed illusion through its outward appearance, yet authenticity         in the exhibits showcased in the buildings. Much of the architecture and         iconography displayed nostalgia, yet the official theme looked to the         future. Previous U.S. expositions had been commemorative events celebrating         the country&#146;s history;<sup>5</sup> the Panama-Pacific fair celebrated         the Panama Canal, a symbol of contemporary aggressive enterprise.</p>      <p> More specifically the contrasts evident in the fair are as follows.         The palaces were designed in a Beaux Arts-like arrangement with a distinctly         anti-Beaux-Arts use of color and a popular perception of the fairgrounds         as an &#147;Oriental City&#148;; the size of the fairgrounds stood in         direct contrast to that of previous expositions and can therefore also         be read as anti-Beaux-Arts. The lofty ideals espoused by the fair officials         stood in direct contrast to the obvious fake quality of the fair buildings.         The decoration reflected sentimentality and nostalgia, although the official         theme looked to the future. The official touting of world peace was undermined         by the overwhelming use of U.S. themes in the iconography of the decorations.         As a paradigm of conflicts the fair was both a relic of the past and a         harbinger of the future, a dichotomy of old and new, and a reflection         of national identity during the first decades of the twentieth century.</p>      <p> The contrasts exhibited by the plan of the fairgrounds are based on         the unusual nature of the design. Unlike earlier American expositions,         which featured neoclassically-inspired exhibition palaces arranged ceremoniously         over large areas, the plan was centered around a much more compact series         of courts or plazas that were arranged in a distinctly Beaux-Arts fashion         (see Figure 1). The arrangement of courts was intended as a direct contrast         to the formal and severe nature of its immediate predecessors. It was         intended to be comfortable, easy on both the eyes (unlike the overwhelming         whiteness of the World&#146;s Columbian Exposition) and feet (the most         recent fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, was the largest ever held         in the United States). A large tower (the Tower of Jewels) was placed         above the main avenue of entrance to the courts or plazas that were situated         in two ranks on an east-west axis. On this axis were the central and two         subsidiary courts (the Court of the Universe and the Courts of Abundance         and Four Seasons). Two additional courts were placed to the south of the         subsidiary courts (the Courts of Flowers and Palms). The result was a         pleasing, harmonious, symmetrical, and ceremonial arrangement. However,         the Beaux-Arts similarities end there. The styles chosen by the architects         varied, and the decision to avoid a neoclassically inspired central mandate         for design was a clear departure from previous American expositions. The         designs of the palaces, courts, and walls ran the gamut from Spanish-Moorish         to old Italian. </p>      <p> Once the courts were designed, Jules Guerin, the New York-based painter         hired as the fair&#146;s Chief of Color, was called in to design a color         scheme for the grounds. The idea behind coloring the site was a reflection         of the fair&#146;s unique place within the history of expositions. By         1915 archaeology had revealed that the ancients had colored their buildings         and sculpture. This scientific, archaeological, and Progressive aspect         appealed to the fair&#146;s planners, who determined that the Panama Pacific         International Exposition would make a conscious departure from the White         City tradition inaugurated by the World&#146;s Columbian Exposition.<sup>6</sup>         Despite this &#147;Progressive&#148; element, the use of color in the         buildings expressed a definite sense of nostalgia. Every element of the         fair was assigned a specific color in order to hark back to the classical         past as it was now understood and to harmonize the potentially disparate         architectural and design elements. Guerin chose nine colors from the surrounding         countryside; the most notable element of the scheme, in light of the history         of U.S. expositions, was that white was not to be used at all.</p>      <p> Because each court was essentially designed in a different style, and         these styles varied widely, and each architectural and decorative element         within the courts was colored, the resulting composition seemed distinctly         not Beaux-Arts. Indeed the fair was called the &#147;Oriental City&#148;         or the &#147;Walled City&#148; because of the many visual similarities         to Mediterranean and Eastern architecture. All the courts and free-standing         buildings (with the exception of the Court of the Universe) were described         as Mediterranean, which, according to one chronicler, meant not just Byzantine,         or Roman, or Italian, or Spanish, or Moorish, but a little of each.<sup>7</sup>         In addition the inclusion of an enclosing wall around the fairgrounds         was taken from the defense wall so common to Latin American, Spanish and         Southern Mediterranean architecture. The site, the southern end of the         Golden Gate at the entry to the Bay, originally a sloping beach, reminded         the architects of a Mediterranean setting, and this suggested the idea         of a far eastern city with large walled-in buildings sheltering courts.      <p> While the architecture did not resemble any previous exposition, it         calls to mind contemporary movie palaces and the illusory quality of movie         sets. By 1915 movie palaces were springing up all over the country, replacing         nickelodeon houses, and their architectural styles borrowed heavily from         exotic and romantic architecture, as did the fair. Dramatic costume epics         were also becoming immensely popular by the middle of the second decade,         especially epics dealing with classical subjects. The Court of the Universe,         the fair&#146;s central and most iconographically important location,         designed in an ornate Italian Renaissance style, immediately evokes films         like the 1913 Italian epic Quo Vadis, or D.W. Griffith&#146;s 1916 Intolerance         for which the Tower of Jewels served as the inspiration for the Babylon         set.<sup>8</sup> By 1915 California was recognized as the major center         of the country&#146;s film production with studios located as far north         as San Francisco.<sup>9</sup> </p>      <p> </p>      <table width="127" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="172">        <tr>           <td><a href="lufts_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="lufts/lufts_2.jpg" width="148" height="234" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="10">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="lufts_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               2:</b> Alexander Stirling Calder, Fountain of Energy.</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Alexander Stirling Calder's &quot;Fountain of Energy&quot; in the South         Gardens was the first piece of monumental sculpture to greet visitors         as they entered the main gates of the &quot;Walled City&quot; (Figure         2). It symbolized the &quot;creation of the Isthmian waterway between         the oceans&quot;<sup>10</sup> with special emphasis on the role played         by the U.S. Allegorical figures representing the four oceans of the world&#151;the         North Sea, South Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans&#151;were placed         around a sphere symbolizing the world. Upon this sphere were reclining         figures of the two hemispheres, and topping the entire composition was         an equestrian figure representing the Victor, described by one critic         as a typically &#147;American&#148; male.<sup>11</sup> The theme of this         work was the idea of Energy: as the Conqueror; mental and physical energy;         Energy the will that achieved the Canal.<sup>12</sup> It was also often         declared the Power of America Rising from the Sea.<sup>13</sup> The work         was a declaration of the engineering and technological skill of the United         States, and was designed to propagandize the country&#146;s part in the         completion of the Canal.       <p> Nearby the ideologies of Social Darwinism, westward expansion, and the         superiority of the white/American race found expression in locations where         the official theme, global peace and harmony, was supposed to dominate,         such as the Tower of Jewels (Thomas Hastings, architect) (Figure 3) and         the Court of the Universe (McKim, Mead and White, architects) (Figure         4). Rising to four hundred and thirty five feet, with great Roman arches         rising to one hundred sixty feet, the Tower of Jewels was covered with         thousands of pieces of Austrian crystal, which, when illuminated at night,         sparkled like jewels. The tower was the fair's real entrance, leading         directly into the Court of the Universe. It played three roles: it was         the central form upon which all the buildings were balanced; it was the         triumphal gateway to this commemorative celebration of an event which         it itself summarized in sculpture, painting and inscriptions; and it was         considered the epitome of the exposition&#146;s art.<sup>14</sup> Through         inscriptions on the south face, the Tower told the story of Panama and         the Pacific shore northward from the Canal Zone. The north face related         the history of California, emphasizing for the visitor the U.S.&#146;s         role in both the exposition and the Canal.</p>      <p> </p>      <table width="104" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="230">        <tr>           <td><a href="lufts_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="lufts/lufts_3.jpg" width="188" height="219" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="10">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="lufts_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               3:</b> Thomas Hastings, Tower of Jewels.</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Atop the Tower a series of figures by the sculptor John Flanagan represented         Euro-American civilization, consisting of the &#147;Philosopher,&#148;         &#147;Priest,&#148; &#147;Soldier,&#148; and &#147;Adventurer&#148;. These         figures symbolized men who &#147;conquered&#148; the western United States.         At the base of the Tower were Charles Niehaus's &#147;Cortez&#148; and         Charles Carey Rumsey's &#147;Pizarro,&#148; two Spanish explorers. Two         works within the Tower, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney&#146;s &#147;Fountain         of El Dorado&#148; and Edith Woodman Burroughs&#146;s &#147;Fountain of         Youth&#148; furthered the Spanish element. The overriding emphasis here         is the perceived mythology surrounding South America and Spanish civilization         with the goal of stressing the joining of continents and cultures by the         Canal. </p>      <p> However, the inclusion of two mural triptychs by William DeLeftwich         Dodge forces us to read the entire tower as a celebration of western civilization         in the New World. Dodge placed his triptychs, &#147;The Atlantic and the         Pacific&#148;, flanked by &#147;Discovery&#148; and &#147;The Purchase&#148;,         and &#147;The Gateway of All Nations,&#148; flanked by &#147;Achievement&#148;         and &#147;Labor Crowned,&#148; below the Roman arches. Their official         role was to celebrate the completion of the Canal through its history,         spirit and achievement, and its future services. At the same time the         imagery distinctly concerns the United States. &#147;The Gateway of All         Nations&#148;, for example, includes modern machinery, a nod to U.S. technological         triumph.</p>      <p> Through the Tower of Jewels the visitor next encountered McKim, Mead         and White's Court of the Universe. The primary &#150; that is &#150; most         visible works are clear representations of the theme of global peace and         harmony. On the eastern and western ends were two large triumphal arches,         the Arches of the Rising Sun and the Setting Sun, topped, respectively,         with sculptural groups representing the Nations of the East and West (collaborative         efforts by Calder, Leo Lentelli and Frederick G.R. Roth). Both of these         groups represented the types of men and women who molded their respective         civilizations. In front of the arches were two groups by Paul Manship,         &#147;Order and Chaos&#148; and &#147;Eternity and Change&#148;. Situated         on either side of the court's center were two fountains by Adolph Weinman,         the Fountains of the Rising and Setting Suns, symbolizing the scope of         the Canal. The Nations of the East and West groups combined with Weinman's         works express the court's function as the meeting place of all nations.       </p>      <p> </p>      <table width="203" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="167">        <tr>           <td><a href="lufts_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="lufts/lufts_4.jpg" width="200" height="151" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="11">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="lufts_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               4:</b> McKim, Mead and White, Court of the Universe.</a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Yet in the context of the court&#146;s murals, conflicting messages appear.         The triumphal arches reveal two sets of murals. In the Nations of the         East arch panels by Edward Simmons depicted &#147;The Lure of the Atlantic&#148;         and &#147;The Visions of Exploration&#148;. The former portrayed the westward         trend of War, Commerce, Conquest, Imagination and Religion from Europe         toward the Atlantic, while the latter dealt with the dreams that led to         the exploration and exploitation of the western United States. Opposite,         in the Nations of the West arch, panels by Frank Vincent DuMond illustrated         the westward march of civilization. Through the image of a young man,         &#147;Leaving the East&#148; and &#147;Arrival in the West&#148; commemorated         the pioneer spirit on the American continent in the march from the Atlantic         to the Pacific. In iconography these murals stand in opposition to the         general iconography of most of the court's decoration. Rather than affirming         universal brotherhood, they celebrate westward expansion and imperialism         by the U.S.</p>      <p> At the northern end of the court, approached via a long colonnaded esplanade         &#147;borrowed&#148; from Bernini's colonnade at St. Peter's, stood the         Column of Progress designed by Symmes Richardson. Atop the Column was         Hermon A. MacNeil's &#147;Adventurous Bowman&#148;; below, friezes representing         the survival of the fittest by Isidor Konti. Although intended as a universal         symbol of achievement, the Bowman was a distinctly western type. In conjunction         with the Darwinian friezes showing men in their onward march through life,         this depiction expresses the ascendancy of western civilization, therefore         complementing the murals by DuMond and Simmons. </p>      <p> </p>      <table width="153" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="143">        <tr>           <td><a href="lufts_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="lufts/lufts_5.jpg" width="200" height="160" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="11">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><a href="lufts_5.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               5:</b> Louis Mullgardt, Court of Abundance. </a></div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Arguably the most interesting and disturbing of the fair's courts was         Louis Mullgardt&#146;s Court of Abundance (Figure 5), epitomizing the         fair&#146;s contrasts. Placed directly to the east of the Court of the         Universe, it was originally called by Mullgardt the Court of Ages. We         find both nostalgia and a glance toward the future; a nod to the Beaux-Arts         within an anti-Beaux-Arts setting; and a direct contradiction of the fair&#146;s         global theme. Mullgardt&#146;s court was more emphatically &#147;Oriental&#148;         than any other. Unlike the other courts the theme was difficult to pin         down. Officially it dealt with the magical power of fire and water, hence         &#147;Abundance&#148;. However, major aspects of the decoration clearly         refer to Social Darwinism. Sculpture on the court&#146;s north tower by         Chester Beach depicted primitive man, the middle ages and modern times.         Atop the arcade, Albert Weinert portrayed primitive men alternating with         a mother and child group. Robert Aitken&#146;s &#147;Fountain of the Earth&#148;         stood in the court&#146;s center. Shaped vaguely like a ship, it told         the story of human life in its many phases. A large orb representing earth         formed the center of the composition, while around the base panels entitled         &#147;Natural Selection and the Survival of the Fittest&#148; treated         human evolution.      <p> Unlike the Court of the Universe, which incorporated works that both         supported and undermined the fair&#146;s agenda regarding the canal and         world peace, the Court of Abundance dealt entirely with subversive subject         matter. Mullgardt's court had no connection to the official ideology.         The architecture and decoration dealt with Darwinian themes in direct         opposition to either concern. Together they expressed nostalgia for the         past, whereas the fair aimed at a celebration of the future. All of these         &#147;unofficial&#148; elements were situated within a courtyard that         was placed on a main axis directly adjacent to the most Beaux-Arts section         of the fair, the Court of the Universe. </p>      <p> World War I began shortly before the fair opened and assured that it         would never again be possible to celebrate an event such as the opening         of the Canal that was intended to represent the steady ascent of progress,         technology and civilization. Illusions of world peace, which, on the surface,         the fair so strongly tried to convey, were shattered and could never again         be attempted. The Panama-Pacific International Exposition was the last         of the great Beaux-Arts fairs, but it opened after its period had ended.         The attempt to reconcile the Genteel Tradition and the ideals of the Progressive         Era would be overshadowed by all too obvious similarities to movie sets         and palaces, sadly the only element of the fair that would persist in         the popular imagination.</p>      <p class="second">&nbsp;    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
