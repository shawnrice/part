During the seven years of               its publication, the New York-based monthly attempted to balance               politics and culture by providing graphic art, which varied from               scathing attacks on capitalists to lighthearted scenes of leisure.               In 1923 the Liberator was turned over to the Workers&#146; Party,               the official name of the Communist party of America. The magazine               shifted from idealistic theory toward a communist line, until ultimately               in 1924 it became the Worker's Monthly. While maintaining its character               as an independent voice for radical intellectuals of the 1920s,               the Liberator was committed to social change, addressing issues               such as the Russian and German revolution, communism, the rights               of African Americans and social injustice. The Liberator was the               only influential American radical publication of the early 1920s               equally committed to politics and art that had both an international               and a widespread national audience. In addition to anticipating               Social Realism of the 1930s, the magazine introduced the concept               of proletarian art, featuring the work of international prominent               communist artists such as Diego Rivera and George Grosz, and American               social artists such as William Gropper and Hugo Gellert. Through               an examination of the Liberator&#146;s historical context, its cultural               policy, and its place among magazine publication, this article seeks               to broaden the scope and role of the politically active artist and               intellectual during the 1910s and 1920s. <sup>1</sup><br>              <br>              In the early twentieth century the medium of popular journalism               was the most effective means to inform the public before the advent               of radio and television. Social consciousness was limited in the               &#147;fine arts&#148; because there was no patronage and the artist               instead turned to the graphic arts. American scholarship is only               now beginning to examine the prominence of illustrators and the               graphic artists of the postwar years of the 1920s as the voice of               a nation struggling with a national identity and its social place               in international events. The term &#147;little renaissance&#148;               has been coined to describe the proliferation of small magazines               in New York between 1908 to 1917. The &#147;little magazine&#148;               provided the appropriate medium of dissent and was devoted to experimentation.               These magazines were established to afford authors an outlet for               works of artistic merit or experimentation that could find no place               in commercial magazines. Among the most notable was the Masses (1911-1917),               the popular forerunner of the Liberator. The Masses set the basic               foundation for the Liberator ; however, historical circumstances               surrounding the Liberator, namely the end of World War I and the               Bolshevik revolution created a markedly different situation. As               the acknowledged successor to the Masses, the Liberator preserved               most of the same editorial staff of writers and artists. Among them               was Max Eastman as the executive editor, and John Reed, Floyd Dell,               Robert Minor, Boardman Robinson and Art Young as contributing editors.               <sup>2</sup><br>              <br>              The Liberator emerged on the cusp of the &#147;little renaissance,&#148;               and serves more as an example of the relatively new, but expanding               radical press, undergoing a major resurgence at this time. Among               the more radical press, which espoused the causes and concerns of               the working class, there were at least six hundred leftist periodicals               published in the early twentieth century, excluding daily newspapers               and local publications. Most were short-lived from various facets               of the labor movement or of the socialist and communist press. The               leftist press was often far ahead of their times in their advocacy               of social reforms and became the chief source for understanding               the radical experience in America. While these publications were               influential to the leftist experience, they did not feature art,               poetry or literature. Radical publications preferred the use of               documentary photography and were not concerned with artistic or               technical merit. Socialist and politically oriented magazines tended               to be didactic, ponderous and somber. And, although the Liberator               was not the only political magazine that included art, none had               its reputation, circulation, and quantity of illustrations, scope               or artistic diversity.<sup>3</sup><br>              <br>              The editors of the Liberator had complete control of its contents               and illustrations. The policy of each editor was essential to the               evolving cultural pedagogy of the magazine. The two most important               editors in the early years were Max Eastman (1883-1969), a well-known               socialist and writer and Floyd Dell (1887-1969), a former magazine               editor and writer from Chicago. Both Eastman and Dell sought an               American equivalent to the Soviet example and expected a transformation               in culture and society; the two being explicitly tied together in               the process. Identification with a foreign revolutionary movement               made radicals vulnerable to charges of anti-Americanism. As a consequence,               one of Eastman&#146;s techniques was to situate the Liberator within               a respectable tradition of American radicalism and social critique.               He claimed that &#147;the right of revolutionary agitation&#148;               was &#147;interwoven in the traditions of this country,&#148; quoting               Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln. The &#147;Americanization&#148;               of Bolshevism became a defining aspect of the Liberator circle&#146;s               definition of the newly emerging communist principles. It seemed               important to radicals to find American equivalents to Russian developments               as a way of completing their own identification with the revolution.               Boardman Robinson&#146;s often-reproduced portrait of Lincoln for               the February 1919 cover serves to reveal the artist&#146;s skill               as a portraitist and conveys his admiration for President Lincoln               as liberator of the oppressed and voice for the masses. The portrait               is also a direct example of situating a revolutionary example in               the context of American tradition, thereby legitimizing American               radicals by claiming Lincoln&#146;s humanitarian legacy as their               own. Stuart Davis similarly captures the early response of Greenwich               Village artists to Bolshevism in the February 1919 issue titled               &#147;Bolshevism in Bohemia.&#148; The scene consists of a lively               group of Bolsheviks and bohemians socializing in a Greenwich Village               caf&eacute; setting. The image transforms the &#147;alien&#148;               nature of the Russian proletarian into the familiar, thereby Americanizing               the foreign element and legitimizing the embrace of Bolshevism.            <sup>4</sup><br>              <br>              Notwithstanding the internationalism of the Liberator, Eastman&#146;s               editorial remarks with regard to culture suggest an ethnocentricity,               which envisioned a distinctly American art. He felt American artists               and writers should cultivate their own experiences and often evoked               the American poet, Walt Whitman. In his review of the work of Stuart               Davis, Eastman observed that even though great art and poetry had               not yet appeared, there was a mood of reckless experimentation that               held promise for the advent of a great &#147;native&#148; American               art and poetry in the tradition of Whitman. For Eastman, art offered               the potential for transformation in the American tradition of transcendentalism.               Similarly, even if seemingly contradictory, Dell used the Soviet               example to call for an American democratic spirit in art: &#147;A               new beginning has been made, and the people . . . are meantime to               be the judges of whether art is doing what art must do to be alive&#151;expressing               their will, their love, their pity, their hopes and fears, their               enthusiasm and their dreams.&#148; Citing Tolstoy and Lincoln, Dell               insisted that &#147;art must be of and for and by the people!&#148;               <sup>5</sup><br>              <br>              After Eastman&#146;s departure from the magazine in 1922 the magazine               progressively shifted toward a more communist line. One of the editors               who succeeded Eastman at this time was Mike Gold (Irwin Granich).               Gold (1893-1967) of Russian-Jewish descent, would later become a               major bridge between the prewar bohemian and the communist literary               movement of the 1930s. Gold&#146;s &#147;Towards Proletarian Art,&#148;               which appeared in the February 1921 issue of the Liberator was a               major document in radical literary theory in the United States and               was virtually the first call for the creation of an art distinctly               by and for the American working class. Gold too sought an indigenous               American art and called for artists to return to their common experience:               &#147;Its roots must be in the fields, factories, and workshops               of American life.&#148; In addition, Gold, unlike most writers of               the Liberator who focused on the international class struggle, grounded               his writing in his immediate circumstances and those circumstances               were New York city. The dominant image portrayed by Gold was the               poverty and misery of the tenements and sweatshops of New York&#146;s               working classes. Gold not only turned to the newly founded Proletkult               in Russia, but also to Walt Whitman as a model for the new proletarian               art. For Gold, Whitman was &#147;the heroic spiritual grandfather               of our generation in America&#148; who envisioned a proletarian               culture through his elevation of the grassroots of America; a man               who dwelt among the masses, and from there drew his strength to               intuitively arrive at proletarian art.<sup>6</sup><br>              <br>              Many literary historians have viewed Whitman&#146;s Leaves of Grass               as a &#147;hymn to the United States.&#148; For Whitman, America               offered unlimited possibilities, its future, undetermined by the               past was rich with infinite promise. In the 1856 preface to Leaves               of Grass, Whitman called for a defining American poetry that corresponded               to the democracy and liberty he envisioned for the New World. In               Whitman&#146;s Letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, he declared that the               poet must not be ashamed of his &#147;native-born perceptions&#148;               but must on the contrary &#147;recognize with joy the sturdy living               forms of the men and women of These States.&#148; Whitman&#146;s               ideology represented more than simply blind patriotism to the United               States, it was a desire for democratic equality; a broad internationalism               that sought universal kinship; a celebration of races and of people.               Also, largely overlooked in cultural history is the profound influence               of Whitman on American radicals and socialists of the early twentieth               century. Whitman&#146;s Leaves of Grass was often circulated and               evoked among leftists writers and intellectuals for its regard for               the common people, democracy, love of Lincoln and poems about European               revolutionists. In the 1930s, even though Whitman was dismissed               by modernists as being sentimental and naively nationalistic, poets               who were socially active and engaged on the political left embraced               his writings. Whitman&#146;s poetry came to be seen by leftists               poets as socially significant; often interpreted as a call to socialist               revolution that was predicated on a return to the land and the land&#146;s               values. In the 1930s Gold continued his praise of Whitman, calling               himself &#147;a son of Whitman,&#148; and ultimately considering               the Whitman a poet of labor revolt. For Gold, Whitman expressed               his concern for the working people, the poor, the marginalized,               and those whose work can be put in the service of social revolution.               <sup>7</sup><br>              <br>              Many of Gold&#146;s cultural theories were residuals of the formative               writings on the subject by Eastman and Dell&#151;the quest for a               distinctly American art, the importance of art in communicating               to the masses, the call for an art relating to the life of reality,               the ability of art to transform society, and the disdain for abstraction.               Gold&#146;s essay set the precedent for defining proletarian art               in America and defined its most significant traits. These characteristics               included: autobiographical identification with the working class,               the prediction of an American renaissance, the necessity of the               artist&#146;s reliance on personal experience, an art that was comprehensible               to the masses, an American equivalent to the Russian model, and               devotion to the Soviet example. In the Liberator editorials, Gold               reasserted his position of the inevitability of an art rising from               grassroots America, from workingmen and women, not from bourgeois-trained               artists and writers.<br>              <br>              Like the editors, Liberator artists also sought to convey a distinctly               American expression to their social content themes. In a lecture               delivered in 1936, Robinson stressed the importance of the art of               the past and was pleased that Regionalism was replacing &#147;the               weak, imitations of European Cubism, Post-Impressionism, and Expressionism.&#148;               As an exponent of American art, he maintained &#147;art is best               when it is native.&#148; Likewise, Lydia Gibson illustrator, writer,               editor, and political activist also upheld a similar point of view.               While Gibson&#146;s art indicates knowledge of modernism, she never               deviated from a naturalistic representation and appears to have               had little patience with contemporary European movements. In a review               of the American artist Adolf Dehn&#146;s work for the May 1923 Liberator,               she intimated her preferences and dislikes. Of Dehn, she wrote:               &#147;He is without the moral despair of Grosz, whose bitterness               presupposes a disappointed ideal; he is free of the sentimentality               of the French, of the fantastic unreality of the Russians.&#148;               Gibson dismissed Grosz&#146;s brand of German expressionism, nineteenth               century French academic tradition, and Russian Futurism. In the               review she emphasized Dehn&#146;s nationality as American; he was               in a unique position to observe and translate &#147;modern life&#148;               because he was &#147;young enough to accept great changes without               regret.&#148; Gibson&#146;s commentary suggests a promotion of American               artists because they would be able to express the modern experience,               which for her, was new, social change for a nation on the cusp of               what she believed was revolutionary transformation.<sup>8</sup><br>              <br>              Artists and editors of the Liberator did not find the use of realism               inconsistent with modernism. When Eastman and Gold called for artists               to return to their native American roots via the tradition of Walt               Whitman, they were indirectly manifesting the avant-garde interest               in exploring a nationalistic heritage. A defining aspect of avant-garde               modernism in the early twentieth century was to explore alternative               art forms that included a re-discovery of nationalistic folk traditions.               After World War I, American nationalism in art had increased, reflecting               in part an effort by artists to find a national identity in competition               with more prestigious European counterparts. The renewal of interest               in American art was evidenced by the opening of the American wing               at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1924, the opening of the Intimate               Gallery, dedicated exclusively to American artists in 1925, the               founding of the Museum of Modern Art in 1929, and the opening of               the Whitney Museum in 1931. While it could be argued that a greater               interest in American art may suggest xenophobia, and by extension               anti-Bolshevik and anti-radical sentiments, the Liberator and its               artists represented the new surge of politicized artists who provided               the historical link between the past and present. Their interest               in American tradition, while seemingly ethnocentric, was an effort               to explore a culture uncorrupted by bourgeois and capitalist standards.               Even though several of the Liberator artists drew direct inspiration               from European leftist art, particularly that of Daumier&#146;s crayon               technique and Grosz&#146;s expressive linear style, few foreign               publications offered entirely appropriate models for commentary               on American society. For the Liberator circle, looking back to the               American grassroots tradition held the promise of a transformation               in culture and society.<sup>9</sup><br>              <br>              Until recently, assumptions of modernism were limited to a definition               based solely on formalism and aestheticism or avant-garde abstraction.               More current scholarship, particularly literary and sociological               studies of the 1920s, has broadened the scope and definition of               modernism. Little magazines offered a way of reading modernism that               had more historical specificity and insight into the complexities               of the era than a single work produced by a single artist. According               to Adam McKible, who attempted to redefine the origins of American               literary modernism in his recent dissertation, &#147;The Space and               Place of Modernism: The Little Magazine in New York,&#148; little               magazines, as an often-underutilized source of analysis, were the               cornerstone of literary modernism in America. Mckible argued that               the time and place of historical change defines modernism and that               for the artists and writers of the Liberator modernism was &#147;found               in the lived experience of historical change.&#148; After the war               and the Russian revolution, America was undergoing enormous changes,               particularly New York, which became a place of uncertainty and revolutionary               instability. Despite the upheaval, there were countless possibilities.               McKible wrote: &#147;Little magazines were the ground zero of modernism;               if modernism exploded upon American culture, then its initial points               of detonation were little magazines.&#148; Melissa Nickle&#146;s               1996 dissertation, &#147;Max Eastman and the Greenwich Village Left,               1900-1929,&#148; pointed out that many studies of the modernist               period end with America&#146;s entry into World War I, thus neglecting               the response of intellectuals to the Bolshevik revolution and as               result, &#147;how modernist impulses shaped the politics of revolutionary               socialism in America.&#148; Nickle concurred that radical intellectuals               were modernists, since art was integral to the project of personal               and social liberation and regeneration. Likewise, according to Martin               Green in his study of the IWW Paterson Strike Pageant and Armory               Show, radical politics was a metaphor for the modern experience               as it transcended the individual self and nineteenth-century bourgeois               notions. If radical politics, the time and place of historical change,               as well as personal and social regeneration constitute aspects of               modernism, then the Liberator and its artists were at the very core               of the modern American experience of the 1920s.<sup>10</sup><br>              <br>              In its ongoing debate between the role of art and politics, the               Liberator was successful in defining a nation in the 1920s and its               place in the aftermath of war and revolution, all of which are critical               to our understanding of American cultural identity and its role               in modernism. Americans were well aware that their nation and national               identity were undergoing enormous changes, and nowhere was that               more evident than in the pages of the Liberator. Artists and writers               of the Liberator, along with their more oft cited counterparts in               the realm of fine arts, contributed to a national identity based               on a socially relevant premise. The Liberator sustained the American               realist tradition, which unfolded as Social Realism of the 1930s.               Ideas about the nature of radical art, conclusions drawn from an               analysis of American culture and definitions of the relation between               the artist and society became central to the 1930s. Social art in               America was primarily tied to newspaper and magazine illustration               and to graphic media. The Liberator and its contributors pioneered               the ongoing debate on the relationship between art and politics,               the conflicting objectives of artistic merit versus political message,               as well as what constituted an indigenous American art. </p>            <p><a href="galot_notes.html">Notes<font class="second">&gt;&gt;</font>               </a></p>            <p><a href="galot_bio.html">Author's Bio<font class="second">&gt;&gt;</font>               </a></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Antoinette Galotola<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font>     </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
