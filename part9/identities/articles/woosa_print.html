In 2001         Assistant Professor of Public Policy Studies at Duke University Noah M.         Pickus testified before the commission about the failure of California's         integration policies in the early 20th century. According to Pickus, the         failure partially stemmed from the coercive policies of the teens and         twenties. Forged in a national context, Pickus' answer is apt.</p>      <p class="second">However, as a method to teach immigrants their rights         and advocate for them, Americanization developed in California during         these years in a more complex manner than Pickus allows. In 1910 the U.S.         census reported that over half of Californians or their children were         immigrants. The state responded to this fact and the related need to make         immigrants feel a part of the American fabric. In California Americanization         was many sided. It opposed disruptive unionism, but was culturally liberal         in many respects. If initially skeptical about the prospects of incorporating         Mexican and Asian immigrants, it was more inclusive of Southeastern European         immigrants than the tenor of the time encouraged. It was strikingly anti-employer         when employers' actions threatened industrial peace, and unusually careful         in teaching immigrants their rights and duties as well as teaching native-born         Americans their obligations to potential citizens.<sup>1</sup></p>      <p class="second"> While not synonymous with ours, the times likewise undulated         with prosperity and war with its attendant boom followed by recession         and depression. In general a number of external currents influenced Americanization         during the teens and twenties: the Progressive movement with its faith         in reshaping society through state intervention; World War I and its call         for patriotism, one hundred per cent Americanism, and fear of all things         foreign, particularly German; and the Red Scare, which raised its head         with the 1917 Bolshevik victory over the Russian monarchy, intensifying         the fear of foreign influences. Each of these currents affected California         in the realm of Americanization, although not always in the way dictated         in studies of the Progressive movement or Americanization, which often         focus on New York as the trendsetter in immigrant policy of the time.</p>      <p class="second"><br>        <b>Progressive Influences</b><br>        Among national debates that raged from the 19th into the 20th century         and were reignited in Congress after the assassination of President McKinley         by the son of Southeastern European immigrants was the question of whether         to exclude immigrants and if so, which ones, based on the racial thinking         of the era. A series of reforms enlarged the categories of immigrants         that were excludable. At the same time other reformers emerged to champion         what they called a domestic immigration policy and what many reformers         now refer to as immigrant policy. This policy argued that the best way         to deal with immigrant unrest was to effectively integrate new comers         into American life, educate them about their rights, and eliminate un-American         exploitation that might lead such immigrants to rebel. This domestic immigration         policy movement was adopted between the teens and twenties in five states,         which contained over half of the country's population of immigrants and         their children. In these states - New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,         and California - reformers successfully established agencies that worked         to Americanize their residents, both immigrant and native-born, and to         eliminate the exploitation beneath immigrant unrest. Trailing New York         by a few years, California was the second state to adopt an Americanization         policy. Oriented toward cultural pluralism, it was one of the most respectful         of immigrant differences for the time.<br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="285" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="275">        <tr>           <td class="second"><a href="woosa_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_2.jpg" width="282" height="214" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_2.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               2:</b>Mexican girls from the Garment Workers Union studying English               from CCIH "Home Teacher Pamphlet".

Lubin, who emphasized the fact that California was likely to         receive an additional influx of Southeastern European immigrants in 1914         when the Panama Canal opened. Four departments - an Americanization department         focusing on educating immigrants in civics, a complaint department, a         migrant labor camp department, and a housing department worked together         to facilitate immigrant Americanization. Under Lubin and his fellow commissioners'         auspices, Americanization took on a unique form. Progressing from a harsher,         more racialist view under Amanda Matthews Chase, CCIH programs assumed         a softer tone under Lubin, Christina Krysto, and Ethel Richardson, even         as Americans faced increasing challenges from abroad. </p>      <p class="second">As an organization CCIH perceived Americanization not         as a one way but a two way process in which both immigrants and their         native-born neighbors were expected to learn and act upon the fundamental         principals of citizenship. These principles involved learning not only         one's duties to the nation, but also one's rights; and actively working         to extend those rights to others in order to reduce destabilizing and         costly discontent. While the main beneficiaries of this program were doubtless         intended to be Southeastern Europeans, and members of the commission left         some very unpleasant remarks about Asian and Mexican Americans on the         historical register, both visual and textual evidence contradicts commonly         invoked assumptions about the state's neglectful attitude towards the         integration of Asian and Mexican American minorities. California's Americanization         program involved all of the above groups and sought to enhance the efficiency,         productivity, and harmony of the state, as well as America's image abroad.         It did so through the influence of a small state bureaucracy that engaged         a broader civil society's voluntary organizations in the service of encouraging         Americans to live up to the principles upon which the country was founded         and teach all immigrants those principles.</p>      <p> <span class="second"><b>World War I</b><br>        World War I intensified a fear that immigrants from the Axis powers, Japan         or Mexico might foment sabotage in the United States. California, carved         out of Mexico in 1848, shares a border with Mexico. This together with         concern that Germany would aid the Mexican government retake its lost         territories set Southwesterners on edge. In response to this situation         California's CCIH continued advocating a sympathetic Americanization policy,         but combined it with spying on the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW),         which led to a more repressive, yet not employer-captive policy. <br>        <br>        </span></p>      <table width="253" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="165">        <tr>           <td height="233" class="second"><a href="woosa_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_3.jpg" width="250" height="208" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_3.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               3:</b> An early form of CCIH efforts to link the treatment of immigrants               to the United State's image abroad, and by extension to foreign               policy.

CCIH community camp         policy appeared only in 1918, a year after American entry into the war         and came under the direct influence of a number of reports by its investigators.         One such report by J.V. Thompson aroused fear regarding the proposed German,         Japanese, and Mexican alliance. The report called for employer housing         to eliminate the congregation of certain races outside their employer's         surveillance and to limit the mobility of saboteurs. The proximity of         Japanese laborers to some of California's best beet and fruit ranches         was seen as an important threat to California's fruit industry. J.V. Thompson         noted that Japanese and Mexican laborers scattered around various California         counties "constitute[d] a menace...worthy of observance;" and Mexican         cowboys and laborers at the Miller and Lux Company near Guadalupe, had         "roundly cursed" President Woodrow Wilson when they heard that the United         States had recognized the Carranza faction in Mexico.<sup>2</sup></p>      <p class="second">Thompson suggested eliminating IWW power in a multi-fold         way. He strove to get rid of the organization's headquarters, alleviate         labor camp conditions and prevent the mobility of laborers as well as         easy access to materials for sabotage. He urged employers "to furnish         transportation, and proper accommodations to their employees" so that         they might be kept under constant surveillance.<sup>3</sup> Additional         calls for internment fell on deaf ears. The federal government, judging         internment beyond existing legal avenues, favored a plan that relied "entirely         on legal actions...On September 5, 1917 Justice Department agents and         police officials invaded IWW homes and halls across the nation and seized         everything that they could find." Trials were held in Fresno and Sacramento,         California.<sup>4</sup> The raids did not stop IWW organizing in agriculture,         copper mining, lumber and other industries, and CCIH sent Thompson to         investigate the Redwood Empire's lumber industry in 1918.<sup>5</sup></p>      <p class="second">CCIH efforts against IWW might suggest that CCIH was,         in fact, captive to industry during the war. Tragically IWW was one of         the few unions that offered a voice for the unskilled trades in which         immigrants tended to congregate. However, it is important to recognize         that CCIH actions during the war were aimed not against unionism, but         violence. As William Preston, the author of a history critical of the         government's repression of IWW during and immediately after WWI, points         out, it is one thing to defend civil liberties in free speech, another         "to accept the continuous violent action of the IWW's at the point of         production."<sup>6</sup> Like the Progressives, CCIH staff and commissioners         distrusted the organized economic power of corporations. Reflecting these         two tendencies, CCIH called both for the suppression of IWW and the vigilantism         practiced by corporations by placing repression in federal hands</p>      <p class="second"> Beyond rhetoric, visual representations of CCIH work         suggest as much. Its labor camp department actively arrested labor camp         operators, especially as the war years waned and the incentive for employers         to follow CCIH proscriptions decreased. Inspectors were sent into the         field and a complaint department was established that encouraged immigrant         and migrant laborers to take responsibility for their own living and working         conditions ( Figure 1). The commission displayed an openness to sponsoring         Americanization classes under the auspices of any interested organization,         including the Garment Workers Union (Figure 2).</p>      <p> <span class="second"><b>The Red Scare</b><br>        While World War I raised the prospect of German, Japanese and Mexican         saboteurs, events in Russia during 1917 intensified Americans' sense of         vulnerability. That year, the Bolsheviks defeated the czars, installing         the world's first socialist government in one of the least likely places.         Insecure Americans began to see the threat of Bolshevism in labor strikes         and elsewhere. Unscrupulous opponents of Progressive reform latched onto         the general fear of the American public as a way to attack social reforms,         often successfully, parading their destruction of Progressive policies         as the triumph of Americanism. Proponents of one type of Americanism (progressive,         pluralistic) battled it out with proponents of another (conservative,         intensely nationalistic, and committed to molding all into one culture).         In this combination of World War I and Red Scare-induced battles, CCIH,         like many other Progressive era agencies and reforms, was accused of communist         sympathies as illustrated in the election campaign of California Governor         Friend W. Richardson and the allegations of the Better America Federation.<br>        <br>        </span></p>      <table width="152" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="265">        <tr>           <td height="233" class="second"><a href="woosa_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_4.jpg" width="201" height="257" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               4:</b> "Americans!"

Equally symptomatic of the backlash, but more induced by the Red         Scare, was the establishment of the Better America Federation (BAF) in         May 1920. As Edwin Layton shows, this reactionary organization assaulted         Progressive legislation - from higher taxes on banks and utilities to         the open shop to the eradication of all state regulatory boards and commissions         including CCIH. BAF accused its opponents of treason and subversion, and         specifically targeted Commissioner and founder, Simon Lubin, and labor         leader and Commissioner Paul Scharrenberg. Meanwhile, the realignment         of political parties in California touted a business ideology that emphasized         corporate organization and efficiency as opposed to the social agencies'         agendas. This new administrative conservatism became institutionalized         by the 1923 election of Richardson as California's governor.<sup>7</sup></p>      <p class="second">BAF represents one of the earliest external challenges         to CCIH. As Edwin Layton notes, BAF campaigned to destroy many of the         Progressives' achievements using the same methods that Americanizers employed         during the war.<sup>8</sup> Although CCIH ultimately discredited BAF by         exposing its private utility interest background, Lubin and Scharrenberg         were damaged by the assaults.<sup>9</sup>The militant nationalism of World         War I and the Red Scare encouraged BAF to use Americanization rhetoric         to discredit its opponents.<sup>10</sup> For example, BAF accused Lubin         and the commission of assisting the IWW <sup>11</sup>. It attacked Scharrenberg         for drawing money from CCIH while lobbying for anti-injunction bills that         increased labor unions' power in strikes.<sup>12</sup> These attacks came         at a vulnerable moment in CCIH history.</p>      <p class="second">Influenced by the Red Scare and the tarring of CCIH with         the taint of Communism, CCIH and the State Board of Education, whose main         Americanization program developer had been trained in CCIH, took the offensive,         promoting the need for Americanization programs for immigrants and their         extension to native-born Americans throughout California. Indeed, in this         volatile climate, CCIH actually moved considerably to the left of Liberal         Americanizers. Its proactive approach to the challenges posed by the Red         Scare was evident as early as 1919. In 1919 and 1920, a series of articles         entitled "The Strength of the Nation" co-authored by commissioner Lubin         and staff member Christina Krysto appeared in The Survey.<sup>13</sup>         These articles refuted the contemporary feeling that the melting pot was         not working, called for a federal department of nation building with bureaus         for the Americanization of both foreign-born and native-born citizens,         and reaffirmed CCIH belief that America's strength derived from its power         to take the talents of immigrants and "while preserving their national         core, to transmute them into a new thing that is essentially American."<sup>14</sup></p>      <p class="second">These articles placed novel emphasis on how the treatment         of immigrants influenced America's international image. Americans were         told that "when one section of the population is a ready victim to exploitation,         the moral tone of the whole land is lowered."<sup>15</sup> They were warned         that the returned immigrant became an example of American life to the         homeland. "Returned emigrants corrupted by the country they have visited,         weakened by excessive labor, impoverished by adverse industrial conditions,         embittered by a series of failures," would be "a burden to the home community         and a menace to the entire homeland"<sup>16</sup>, hardly likely to project         a good image of America (Figure 3).</p>      <p class="second">CCIH 1921 Annual Report argued "that Americanization was         not flag-raising and 'patriotic' howling; it was not suppression of speech         and honest opinion; it was more than teaching English to foreigners" and         involved the "Americanization" of Americans, developing national ideals         and standards in which "all residents, foreign-born as well as native-born"         would be schooled, especially through community participation.<sup>17</sup>         CCIH launched a community organization campaign in 1920 and 1921 insisting         that Americans should "be [their] own Americanizers"!<sup>18</sup> Two         posters that appeared in its Bulletin clearly conveyed to social workers         and readers in general that instead of complaining about immigrants as         radical, unassimilated elements Americans ought to offer their services         to the state to solve the so-called problem (Figure 4). Americanization         was equated with raising all residents (whether foreign or native-born)         to a certain standard of living.</p>      <p class="second">After World War I, CCIH continued to emphasize its belief         that immigrant cultures provided the best materials out of which to build         citizens. Moreover, while California's conservatives won the immediate         election, they lost the long-term battle. The slashing of CCIH budgets         by Governor Richardson was quickly reversed when the governor became inundated         by testimony about CCIH benefits to the state from women's clubs, employers,         and immigrant leaders.</p>      <p class="second">Surely, in California during the teens and twenties, Americanization         was not about one hundred per cent Anglo-conformity or teaching immigrants         to accept a status quo that endangered the industrial safety, health,         and well-being of individuals and the community at large. CCIH opposition         to total Americanism influenced the State Department of Education, which         assumed responsibility for immigrant education in 1920, along with its         branch, the Bureau of Immigrant Education (BIE) in California's Department         of Adult Education. The fact that Ethel Richardson, former Director of         CCIH Bureau of Immigrant Education served on all three of these bodies,         makes clear why this occurred.<sup>19</sup> During the late 1920s, BIE,         which furnished the most material used in immigrant education throughout         the state, resisted demands for immigrant conformity.<sup>20</sup> A 1925         BIE Community Exchange Bulletin proclaims that the "purpose of the home         teacher...is not to encourage the alien to forget his native culture."<sup>21</sup>         <br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="338" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" height="281">        <tr>           <td height="233" class="second"><a href="woosa_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="woosa/woosa_5.jpg" width="335" height="216" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="2">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><a href="woosa_4.html" target="_blank"><b>Fig               5:</b> A class of Japanese immigrant mothers organized by a Home               Teacher in Los Angeles.

CCIH classes involving         Japanese Americans suggest this shift (Figure 5).</p>      <p class="second">The advent of World War II and a bifurcated policy that         incarcerated Japanese Americans while embracing Chinese and Filipino Americans         starkly interrupted CCIH activity. Americanization ultimately disappeared         as a state policy in 1945, when CCIH immigrant protective functions were         abolished. Some fifty years later the Little Hoover Commission reinvestigates         this complex precedent as one of a number of policies that might facilitate         immigrant integration in California for mutual benefit. </p>      <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>&nbsp; </p></body></html>
