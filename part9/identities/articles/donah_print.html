Crawford, &#147;Museum               Documents and Modern Costumes,&#148; The American Museum Journal               18, no.4 1918.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>The idea of an &#147;American&#148; design gained momentum in segments         of the business, museum and design world during the 1910s and 1920s.<sup>1</sup>         Self-conscious interest in the design arts as independent of outside influences         is traceable to the origins of the United States as a nation at the expense         of England.<sup>2</sup> This feeling intensified hand in hand with industrial         expansion, a pace that quickened in the early twentieth century. With         shortages in European design models brought about by World War I, the         need to rely more upon local resources for inspiration, materials and         manufacturing - to take nothing away from genuine national sentiment -         forced the question of identity. Museums were important in this context.<sup>3</sup>         From the east coast to the mid west in Chicago, Cincinnati, Newark, New         York City and Philadelphia, museums actively promoted their holdings as         springboards for American design, strengthening bonds or forging new ones         with the business community, which took advantage of policies that opened         up collections through study rooms, exhibitions and educational programs.<br>        <br>        Since revolutionary colonists wore homespun, design as American has been         intertwined with women&#146;s clothing.<sup>4</sup> The early twentieth-century         quest for a national design was replicated in fashion as ties with Paris,         which held dominance, eroded due to the war. Similarly intent on defining         something American, leaders in the feminine apparel industry in New York         and New Jersey focused on New York museums for the designing of garments,         trim, fabrics and accessories. Today the view about an emerging American         fashion centers on the styles of New York manufacturers and designers,         but a fundamental achievement was to generate and carry out an idea about         a national style, a development more widespread than New York. The use         of American Indian collections has a history of its own worth studying         for what it reveals about the nature of American fashion as well as national         identity, during a time when Euro-Americans increasingly identified with         indigenous peoples as true Americans.<br>        <br>        <b>Conceptualizing American Fashion</b><br>        An American fashion was defined from the combined perspective of the business         and museum world in the main articulated by M.D.C. Crawford, who bridged         both domains. Crawford was a design and research editor for the garment         industry&#146;s influential trade paper, Women&#146;s Wear, and a research         associate in textiles at the American Museum of Natural History in which         capacities he established an alliance between the museum and the garment         and textile trades.<sup>5</sup> By 1917 he had orchestrated the founding         of study rooms, lectures and workshops at the museum to the enthusiasm         of leading manufacturers and designers, among them from the garment business         were Max Meyer of A. Beller &amp; Co., Jessie Franklin Turner of Bonwit         Teller, Edward L. Mayer, J. Rapoport, Mary Walls of John Wanamaker's and         E. J. Wile; and from the cotton and silk industry were Belding Brothers,         Cheney Silk, H. R. Mallinson and Johnson, Cowden &amp; Company. <br>        <br>        Crawford worked in close partnership with Stewart Culin, curator of &#147;ethnography&#148;         at the Brooklyn Museum.<sup>6</sup> Under Culin&#146;s leadership the         museum opened a study room in 1918 and initiated outreach and programming         for the design community, especially in clothing and textiles. For his         part Richard Bach at the Metropolitan Museum of Art embraced the wide         scope of design.<sup>7</sup> Rather, Crawford and Culin set the pace in         Americanizing fashion.<br>        Through his writing Crawford became an important spokesperson for the         fashion and museum world, positing ideas mostly in connection with his         institution and its nonwestern holdings, but which mirrored the thinking         of museums around the country with their various strands of western and         nonwestern objects. This makes clear that fashion gained an American identity         by originating in the United States in terms of concept, materials and         manufacture. Crawford reveals the intent to create a modern American fashion         through an international collection that embraced Africa, the Americas,         Asia, the middle East, Europe and the Pacific islands. In a 1917 article         in the journal of the American Museum of Natural History, he describes         how ready-to-wear and silk and cotton manufacturers looked to the museum         for direction, stating that the &#147;Primitive&#148; American art collection         and the art of China, the Philippines and South Sea Islands would &#147;...serve         as a basis for our own distinctive decorative arts.&#148;<sup>8</sup>         A 1918 article in the same journal entitled &#147;Museum Documents and         Modern Costume&#148; explains that:<br>      </p>      <blockquote>         <p>Instead of the usual method of importing modern foreign costumes [themselves           based, generally, on foreign museum collections], our designers, familiar           with the practical needs of today, have gone direct to original documents           for their inspiration. The work, therefore, marks one of the most important           movements in the development of a truly American type of industrial           art&#133;<sup>9</sup> </p>      </blockquote>      <table width="155" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="donah_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="donah_4.jpg" width="139" height="200" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td height="83">             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 2:</b> Harry Collins installation               at 1919 exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History showing               original designs and garments derived from them.<br>              Herbert J. Spinden, &#147;Creating a National Art,&#148; The American               Museum Journal 19, no.6, Dec. 1919.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>The reference to &#147;industrial art&#148; and &#147;modern costume&#148;         indicates key aspects in the contemporary understanding of American fashion.         The first is advanced technology. The national identity was entwined with         the machine. To be an American design was to be produced in American factories         with American manufactured materials. Technology was in turn equated with         the modern. Although popularly speaking the term &#147;modern&#148; also         meant contemporary, the machine represented up-to-date manufacturing methods,         and designs intended for industrial production were modern for this reason.         The fact is that handicrafts retained importance, but the emphasis was         on design for manufacture.<sup>10</sup> It is not coincidental that most         garment and textile producers and designers interacting with the American         Museum of Natural History and the Brooklyn Museum were engaged in quantity         production.<br>        <br>        It is tempting to apply to design the tendency of 1910s and 1920s American         artists to borrow from Native American and African forms in pursuit of         modern solutions to aesthetic problems - read abstraction.<sup>11</sup>         Although individual designers and manufacturers may have been caught up         in being modern, it would be misleading to apply the same agenda to design.         Fueled by economic motives, the first objective of design is commerce         and thus very different from the undertaking of artists. Taken together         the proximity of &#147;ethnographic&#148; collections and the nurturing         environment provided by Culin and Crawford cultivated an interest in art         outside of western traditions. But this was offset by the utilization         of European art at both the Brooklyn Museum and Metropolitan Museum of         Art.<br>        What use there was of nonwestern art in modern terms pertained largely         to the market appeal of up-to-date styles. This is clear in fashion discourse         that alludes to abstraction. &#147;Blouses of Modern American construction.         In the popular blouses of today, emphasis is laid on harmonious colors         and on designs that have been refined to the point of simplicity,&#148;         highlighted designs recalling Northwest Coast traditions.<sup>12</sup>       </p>      <p><br>        <b>American Fashion Indian Style</b><br>        The impact of Native American art on fashion is discernible in drawings         and garments that survive in illustrations in Crawford&#146;s articles,         especially in Women&#146;s Wear, and installation photographs from museums,         galleries and department stores along with the evidence of exhibition         catalogs and the fashion press.<sup>13</sup> Even a sampling provides         a sense of how American Indian traditions were incorporated. A starting         point is Crawford&#146;s 1918 article mentioned above. It examines the         results of a three-year campaign conducted by Women&#146;s Wear in league         with the American Museum of Natural History in order to improve textile         and garment design.<sup>14</sup> Representing &#147;&#133;the first fruits         of what I may term `creative research&#146; by the American costume industry,&#148;         the article contains four designs associated with Native American traditions,         namely a silk fabric inspired by pottery from the &#147;American Southwest&#148;         (Edward L. Mayer); a sport coat with embroidery based on &#147;primitive&#148;         basketry (A. Beller) (Figure 1); and under the caption &#147;Designs suggested         by Indian Documents&#148; :<br>      </p>      <blockquote>         <p>At the left a dinner gown, or negligee, embroidered in wool. The method           of connecting the ends of the belt was suggested by girdles from the           Goajiro Indians in the museum&#146;s collections from northern Columbia,           and the decoration was inspired by a study of North American Indian           collections (Bonwit Teller).<br>          <br>        </p>        <p>At the right. A black satin evening gown with silken and bead tassels.           The idea of the tassels owes its origin to the buckskin thongs that           hang from a Dakota Indian costume (Edward L. Mayer).</p>      </blockquote>      <p>A milestone in this history involves thirtyfour displays of dress and         accessories shown in the &quot;Exhibition of Industrial Art in Textiles         and Costumes&quot; at The American Museum of Natural History in November,         1919. The catalog together with an article in the Museum Journal entitled,         &#147;Creating a National Art&#148;, written by Herbert J. Spinden, Assistant         Curator, Department of Anthropology, indicates the goal of achieving a         modern American design through the global collections housed in the museum.<sup>15</sup>         Held in the &#147;North American Indian Hall&#148;, the exhibition included         gowns in style and trim inspired by designs from Guatemala by J. Wise         &amp; Co., and from the Plains by Harry Collins (Figures 2). Two blouses         by B.C. Faulkner suggest the patterns and styles associated with the Northwest         Coast and Plains Indians shirts. David Aaron &amp; Co., a manufacturer         of embroidery, drew on a variety of sources such as Pueblan in an effort         to demonstrate the use of art from around the globe &#147;in modern machine-made         embroidery&#148; (Figure 3). Similarly The American Bead Company borrowed         from Woodlands traditions in order to produce &#147;Modern uses of Beads         in Dress Accessories&#148;.<br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="256" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="donah_5.html" target="_blank"><img src="donah_5.jpg" width="250" height="166" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 3:</b> The Brooklyn Standard               Union, November 10, 1919.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>Overall the Native American influence derives from baskets, pottery and         textiles associated with the northern hemisphere (Northwest Coast, Southwest         and Woodlands cultures). As for garments shirts prove to be the most significant         in keeping with designs from both continents. From these, color, patterns,         motifs and materials were adapted in the designing of trim and ornamentation         for staples like dresses, suits, coats, blouses and lingerie, and for         dress fabrics and accessories. There is a constant dialogue with the prevailing         Parisian line, but also departures that would be more extensive if more         were extant. It is surprising how closely the dresses by Harry Collins         resemble the original Plains Indian garment (Figure 4). Crawford&#146;s         1918 article describes something similar in an &#147;...automobile wrap         in pongee silk, practically an exact copy of a Korean grass linen garment.&quot;<sup>16</sup>         A 1926 article in the bulletin of The Metropolitan Museum of Art states:       </p>      <blockquote>         <p>Thus we know of the costume designer who spent her time at the Museum           seated alone in a gallery of Near Eastern art. She made no notes, she           went to no other galleries, she simply &#145;exposed&#146; herself to           the influence of graceful line and gentle color, knowing her own receptivity           to such effects. The result was a whole series of models recalling in           form nothing she had seen at the Museum, yet subtly registering in color           key and in certain treatments of line the effect of the &#145;exposure.&#146;<sup>17</sup>         </p>      </blockquote>      <table width="225" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="donah_3.html" target="_blank"><img src="donah_3.jpg" width="250" height="132" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 4:</b> David Aaron &amp;               Co. installation at 1919 exhibition at the American Museum of Natural               History showing museum and modern designs.<br>              Herbert J. Spinden, &#147;Creating a National Art,&#148; The American               Museum Journal 19, no.6, Dec. 1919.</div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>      <p>The fashion press reveals that the museum&#146;s impact on blouses was         not limited to the designing of trim and ornamentation, but dictated the         line of silhouettes, hems, necks and sleeves. Because it was then crucial         to a woman&#146;s wardrobe, the history of the blouse is doubly important         in the Americanization of fashion. In fall, 1919 Women&#146;s Wear galleries         showcased &#147;blouses&#148; from around the world donated by the American         Museum of Natural History and the Brooklyn Museum in which Native American         examples were prominent.<sup>18</sup> The exhibition generated a lot of         attention in the trade. Within weeks Women&#146;s Wear depicted garments         that grew out of it, including a blouse &#147;fashioned after a garment         of the Plains Indians made of elk skin and brilliantly trimmed with quill         work.&#148;<sup>19</sup> The excitement sparked a buyer and designer for         Abraham and Strauss department store in Brooklyn to develop a line of         blouses, which were advertised in local newspapers and prominently mounted         in a window along with the originals: one depended on the culture of the         Plains and another on the Huichol Indians of Northern Mexico.<sup>20</sup>         These adaptations show how closely the original garments were followed         (Figure 5).<br>        <br>        In the end it is easy to call the search for an American fashion a success         from the standpoint of the New York museum group in the terms it set for         itself, at least partially. The intention was to utilize the country&#146;s         potential in materials, manufacturing and design for which an abundance         of evidence survives in the fashion and museum press. In retrospect the         adoption of nonwestern art was not new in fashion, but traceable to France         prior to the war.<sup>21</sup> However, as developed in New York beginning         in 1917, this tendency was rooted in this country with a mindset directed         toward local museums and based at times on indigenous sources.<br>        <br>        Research needs to be done in order to determine how other garment areas         such as Cleveland and Chicago responded to the institutional support of         museums and to New York as a style center. As of now costume historians         who judge the Americanness of the 1910s and 1920s focus on style and a         handful of figures in the thriving garment center of New York City.<sup>22</sup>         Histories are waiting to be told elsewhere that promise to yield a variety         in American fashion under the direction of museums. The Sears catalog,         for example, sold blouses reminiscent of Plains Indians shirts and bathrobes         inspired by Pueblan textiles to women across the country from 1918 through         the 1920s.<sup>23</sup> <br>        <br>      </p>      <table width="96" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">        <tr>           <td><a href="donah_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="donah_2.jpg" width="142" height="200" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>        </tr>        <tr valign="top">           <td>             <div align="center" class="sixth"><b>Fig 5:</b> Model with J.

In Playing Indian Philip J. Deloria maps a history         of Euro-American men donning feathers, blankets and face paint in activities         hinged upon finding a national self.<sup>25</sup> While persisting from         colonists who threw tea into Boston harbor, to nineteenth-century aspiring         national poets and Woodcraft Indians to the men&#146;s movement, more         recently, it wasn&#146;t until the early 20th century that playing Indian         became solidly entrenched among women and when it did it was in terms         of the Campfire Girls. Stemming from the late 19th century this organization         took hold in the 1910s, borrowing from Ernest Thompson Seton&#146;s Woodcraft         Indians, which stressed Indianness as a key part of American manhood.         With values rooted in nature and physical work Seton sought to bolster         masculinity in city boys feminized by industrialization. Campfire Girls,         under the guidance of Luther and Charlotte Gulick, aimed at shaping ideals         of American femininity in linkage with Native American women and their         tie with nature, motherhood and domesticity. As a way to emphasize this         affinity, the membership made and wore clothes in imitation of their models.         Deloria puts the incorporation of women into the tradition of playing         Indian into a larger picture entwined with national identity in line with         &#147;&#133;modernity, which has used Indian play to encounter the authentic         amidst the anxiety of urban industrial and postindustrial life.&#148;<sup>26</sup>         <br>        <br>      </p>      <p>Although recognized as American and invoked to prove the existence of         a national style, self definition through American Indians did not belong         in the main to the fashion world&#146;s program. Things Native American         were not singled out in the museum collections and thus cannot be counted         as part of an identity quest via indigenous peoples. The latter then preoccupied         many white Americans, especially after the war, coupled with a novel appreciation         for American Indian culture, which is where fashion enters the picture.<sup>27</sup>         Even though in general the fashion discourse is stereotypical and ethnocentric,         it expresses genuine interest in the aesthetic value contained in Native         American cultural forms, and recognizes therein art rather than ethnography         in step with the new thinking. Just compare &#147;Primitive American art         collection&#148; and &#147;Made in slate gray Georgette crepe, the wide         bands incorporate all the exquisite color sense of men who looked to Nature         for all their colorings.&#148;</p>      <p>Rather than an antidote to industrial angst, the adoption of Native American         forms can be linked to a celebration of machine technology and to the         related question of Americanness, a situation addressed in 1919 by Crawford:</p>      <blockquote>         <p> The exhibit in the Mallinson booth is in every detail essentially           American. The silks have been woven and printed in the eight Mallinson           mills in America, the designs have been created right here in America,           and in many instances were inspired by American sources. In practically           all instances, the designers, themselves American, have studied, dreamed           and originated in American atmosphere.<sup>28</sup> </p>      </blockquote>      <p>The stress on technology and Americanness in design in general is understandable         as a way to offset the economic crisis brought about by the war and to         bolster industry, which had a positive influence in advancing the profession         of designer, even as it outdistanced handicrafts and created problems         for labor.<sup>29</sup> The striving in fashion to make something distinctly         American produced in number offered a needed alternative to the stratified         world that the Parisian couture represented, despite the fact that differences         in cost and status remained. But the mark was missed in not paying more         attention to the conditions of the users and not following through to         the fullest, when in the mid 1920s eyes turned again toward Paris.<br>        <br>        What about the women outside of the Campfire Girls who knowingly wore         fashionable items indebted to Native American culture? Is this an attempt         to identify with Indians as Americans, a phase in the construction of         American femininity, a stance against Paris, or a fashion expression?         Are the four mutually exclusive? I will follow the lead of Deloria in         recognizing a paradoxical relationship concerning national identity, American         Indians and fashion design to end with the mental image of white girls         at play dressed up like &#147;Indian braves&#148;.<sup>30</sup> <br>      </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>    </td>    <td width="31">&nbsp; </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
