Crawford,                     &#147;Museum Documents and Modern Costumes,&#148; The American                     Museum Journal 18, no.4 1918.</div>                </td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">The idea of an &#147;American&#148; design gained               momentum in segments of the business, museum and design world during               the 1910s and 1920s.<sup>1</sup> Self-conscious interest in the               design arts as independent of outside influences is traceable to               the origins of the United States as a nation at the expense of England.<sup>2</sup>               This feeling intensified hand in hand with industrial expansion,               a pace that quickened in the early twentieth century. With shortages               in European design models brought about by World War I, the need               to rely more upon local resources for inspiration, materials and               manufacturing - to take nothing away from genuine national sentiment               - forced the question of identity. Museums were important in this               context.<sup>3</sup> From the east coast to the mid west in Chicago,               Cincinnati, Newark, New York City and Philadelphia, museums actively               promoted their holdings as springboards for American design, strengthening               bonds or forging new ones with the business community, which took               advantage of policies that opened up collections through study rooms,               exhibitions and educational programs.<br>              <br>              Since revolutionary colonists wore homespun, design as American               has been intertwined with women&#146;s clothing.<sup>4</sup> The               early twentieth-century quest for a national design was replicated               in fashion as ties with Paris, which held dominance, eroded due               to the war. Similarly intent on defining something American, leaders               in the feminine apparel industry in New York and New Jersey focused               on New York museums for the designing of garments, trim, fabrics               and accessories. Today the view about an emerging American fashion               centers on the styles of New York manufacturers and designers, but               a fundamental achievement was to generate and carry out an idea               about a national style, a development more widespread than New York.               The use of American Indian collections has a history of its own               worth studying for what it reveals about the nature of American               fashion as well as national identity, during a time when Euro-Americans               increasingly identified with indigenous peoples as true Americans.<br>              <br>              <b>Conceptualizing American Fashion</b><br>              An American fashion was defined from the combined perspective of               the business and museum world in the main articulated by M.D.C.               Crawford, who bridged both domains. Crawford was a design and research               editor for the garment industry&#146;s influential trade paper,               Women&#146;s Wear, and a research associate in textiles at the American               Museum of Natural History in which capacities he established an               alliance between the museum and the garment and textile trades.<sup>5</sup>               By 1917 he had orchestrated the founding of study rooms, lectures               and workshops at the museum to the enthusiasm of leading manufacturers               and designers, among them from the garment business were Max Meyer               of A. Beller &amp; Co., Jessie Franklin Turner of Bonwit Teller,               Edward L. Mayer, J. Rapoport, Mary Walls of John Wanamaker's and               E. J. Wile; and from the cotton and silk industry were Belding Brothers,               Cheney Silk, H. R. Mallinson and Johnson, Cowden &amp; Company.               <br>              <br>              Crawford worked in close partnership with Stewart Culin, curator               of &#147;ethnography&#148; at the Brooklyn Museum.<sup>6</sup> Under               Culin&#146;s leadership the museum opened a study room in 1918 and               initiated outreach and programming for the design community, especially               in clothing and textiles. For his part Richard Bach at the Metropolitan               Museum of Art embraced the wide scope of design.<sup>7</sup> Rather,               Crawford and Culin set the pace in Americanizing fashion.<br>              Through his writing Crawford became an important spokesperson for               the fashion and museum world, positing ideas mostly in connection               with his institution and its nonwestern holdings, but which mirrored               the thinking of museums around the country with their various strands               of western and nonwestern objects. This makes clear that fashion               gained an American identity by originating in the United States               in terms of concept, materials and manufacture. Crawford reveals               the intent to create a modern American fashion through an international               collection that embraced Africa, the Americas, Asia, the middle               East, Europe and the Pacific islands. In a 1917 article in the journal               of the American Museum of Natural History, he describes how ready-to-wear               and silk and cotton manufacturers looked to the museum for direction,               stating that the &#147;Primitive&#148; American art collection and               the art of China, the Philippines and South Sea Islands would &#147;...serve               as a basis for our own distinctive decorative arts.&#148;<sup>8</sup>               A 1918 article in the same journal entitled &#147;Museum Documents               and Modern Costume&#148; explains that:<br>            </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Instead of the usual method of importing modern                 foreign costumes [themselves based, generally, on foreign museum                 collections], our designers, familiar with the practical needs                 of today, have gone direct to original documents for their inspiration.                 The work, therefore, marks one of the most important movements                 in the development of a truly American type of industrial art&#133;<sup>9</sup>               </p>            </blockquote>            <table width="155" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td class="second"><a href="donah_4.html" target="_blank"><img src="donah_4.jpg" width="139" height="200" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td height="83">                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                     2:</b> Harry Collins installation at 1919 exhibition at the                     American Museum of Natural History showing original designs                     and garments derived from them.<br>                    Herbert J.

The first is advanced technology.               The national identity was entwined with the machine. To be an American               design was to be produced in American factories with American manufactured               materials. Technology was in turn equated with the modern. Although               popularly speaking the term &#147;modern&#148; also meant contemporary,               the machine represented up-to-date manufacturing methods, and designs               intended for industrial production were modern for this reason.               The fact is that handicrafts retained importance, but the emphasis               was on design for manufacture.<sup>10</sup> It is not coincidental               that most garment and textile producers and designers interacting               with the American Museum of Natural History and the Brooklyn Museum               were engaged in quantity production.<br>              <br>              It is tempting to apply to design the tendency of 1910s and 1920s               American artists to borrow from Native American and African forms               in pursuit of modern solutions to aesthetic problems - read abstraction.<sup>11</sup>               Although individual designers and manufacturers may have been caught               up in being modern, it would be misleading to apply the same agenda               to design. Fueled by economic motives, the first objective of design               is commerce and thus very different from the undertaking of artists.               Taken together the proximity of &#147;ethnographic&#148; collections               and the nurturing environment provided by Culin and Crawford cultivated               an interest in art outside of western traditions. But this was offset               by the utilization of European art at both the Brooklyn Museum and               Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br>              What use there was of nonwestern art in modern terms pertained largely               to the market appeal of up-to-date styles. This is clear in fashion               discourse that alludes to abstraction. &#147;Blouses of Modern American               construction. In the popular blouses of today, emphasis is laid               on harmonious colors and on designs that have been refined to the               point of simplicity,&#148; highlighted designs recalling Northwest               Coast traditions.<sup>12</sup> </p>            <p class="second"><br>              <b>American Fashion Indian Style</b><br>              The impact of Native American art on fashion is discernible in drawings               and garments that survive in illustrations in Crawford&#146;s articles,               especially in Women&#146;s Wear, and installation photographs from               museums, galleries and department stores along with the evidence               of exhibition catalogs and the fashion press.<sup>13</sup> Even               a sampling provides a sense of how American Indian traditions were               incorporated. A starting point is Crawford&#146;s 1918 article mentioned               above. It examines the results of a three-year campaign conducted               by Women&#146;s Wear in league with the American Museum of Natural               History in order to improve textile and garment design.<sup>14</sup>               Representing &#147;&#133;the first fruits of what I may term `creative               research&#146; by the American costume industry,&#148; the article               contains four designs associated with Native American traditions,               namely a silk fabric inspired by pottery from the &#147;American               Southwest&#148; (Edward L.

The catalog together               with an article in the Museum Journal entitled, &#147;Creating a               National Art&#148;, written by Herbert J. Spinden, Assistant Curator,               Department of Anthropology, indicates the goal of achieving a modern               American design through the global collections housed in the museum.<sup>15</sup>               Held in the &#147;North American Indian Hall&#148;, the exhibition               included gowns in style and trim inspired by designs from Guatemala               by J.

David               Aaron &amp; Co., a manufacturer of embroidery, drew on a variety               of sources such as Pueblan in an effort to demonstrate the use of               art from around the globe &#147;in modern machine-made embroidery&#148;               (Figure 3).

As for garments               shirts prove to be the most significant in keeping with designs               from both continents. From these, color, patterns, motifs and materials               were adapted in the designing of trim and ornamentation for staples               like dresses, suits, coats, blouses and lingerie, and for dress               fabrics and accessories. There is a constant dialogue with the prevailing               Parisian line, but also departures that would be more extensive               if more were extant. It is surprising how closely the dresses by               Harry Collins resemble the original Plains Indian garment (Figure               4). Crawford&#146;s 1918 article describes something similar in               an &#147;...automobile wrap in pongee silk, practically an exact               copy of a Korean grass linen garment.&quot;<sup>16</sup> A 1926               article in the bulletin of The Metropolitan Museum of Art states:             </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Thus we know of the costume designer who spent                 her time at the Museum seated alone in a gallery of Near Eastern                 art.

Because               it was then crucial to a woman&#146;s wardrobe, the history of the               blouse is doubly important in the Americanization of fashion. In               fall, 1919 Women&#146;s Wear galleries showcased &#147;blouses&#148;               from around the world donated by the American Museum of Natural               History and the Brooklyn Museum in which Native American examples               were prominent.<sup>18</sup> The exhibition generated a lot of attention               in the trade. Within weeks Women&#146;s Wear depicted garments that               grew out of it, including a blouse &#147;fashioned after a garment               of the Plains Indians made of elk skin and brilliantly trimmed with               quill work.&#148;<sup>19</sup> The excitement sparked a buyer and               designer for Abraham and Strauss department store in Brooklyn to               develop a line of blouses, which were advertised in local newspapers               and prominently mounted in a window along with the originals: one               depended on the culture of the Plains and another on the Huichol               Indians of Northern Mexico.<sup>20</sup> These adaptations show               how closely the original garments were followed (Figure 5).<br>              <br>              In the end it is easy to call the search for an American fashion               a success from the standpoint of the New York museum group in the               terms it set for itself, at least partially. The intention was to               utilize the country&#146;s potential in materials, manufacturing               and design for which an abundance of evidence survives in the fashion               and museum press. In retrospect the adoption of nonwestern art was               not new in fashion, but traceable to France prior to the war.<sup>21</sup>               However, as developed in New York beginning in 1917, this tendency               was rooted in this country with a mindset directed toward local               museums and based at times on indigenous sources.<br>              <br>              Research needs to be done in order to determine how other garment               areas such as Cleveland and Chicago responded to the institutional               support of museums and to New York as a style center. As of now               costume historians who judge the Americanness of the 1910s and 1920s               focus on style and a handful of figures in the thriving garment               center of New York City.<sup>22</sup> Histories are waiting to be               told elsewhere that promise to yield a variety in American fashion               under the direction of museums. The Sears catalog, for example,               sold blouses reminiscent of Plains Indians shirts and bathrobes               inspired by Pueblan textiles to women across the country from 1918               through the 1920s.<sup>23</sup> <br>              <br>            </p>            <table width="96" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left" border="1" bordercolor="#000000">              <tr>                 <td class="second"><a href="donah_2.html" target="_blank"><img src="donah_2.jpg" width="142" height="200" border="0" alt="Click for Larger Image"></a></td>              </tr>              <tr valign="top">                 <td>                   <div align="center" class="sixth"><span class="second"><b>Fig                     5:</b> Model with J.

In Playing Indian Philip J.               Deloria maps a history of Euro-American men donning feathers, blankets               and face paint in activities hinged upon finding a national self.<sup>25</sup>               While persisting from colonists who threw tea into Boston harbor,               to nineteenth-century aspiring national poets and Woodcraft Indians               to the men&#146;s movement, more recently, it wasn&#146;t until               the early 20th century that playing Indian became solidly entrenched               among women and when it did it was in terms of the Campfire Girls.               Stemming from the late 19th century this organization took hold               in the 1910s, borrowing from Ernest Thompson Seton&#146;s Woodcraft               Indians, which stressed Indianness as a key part of American manhood.               With values rooted in nature and physical work Seton sought to bolster               masculinity in city boys feminized by industrialization. Campfire               Girls, under the guidance of Luther and Charlotte Gulick, aimed               at shaping ideals of American femininity in linkage with Native               American women and their tie with nature, motherhood and domesticity.               As a way to emphasize this affinity, the membership made and wore               clothes in imitation of their models. Deloria puts the incorporation               of women into the tradition of playing Indian into a larger picture               entwined with national identity in line with &#147;&#133;modernity,               which has used Indian play to encounter the authentic amidst the               anxiety of urban industrial and postindustrial life.&#148;<sup>26</sup>               <br>              <br>            </p>            <p class="second">Although recognized as American and invoked to prove               the existence of a national style, self definition through American               Indians did not belong in the main to the fashion world&#146;s program.               Things Native American were not singled out in the museum collections               and thus cannot be counted as part of an identity quest via indigenous               peoples. The latter then preoccupied many white Americans, especially               after the war, coupled with a novel appreciation for American Indian               culture, which is where fashion enters the picture.<sup>27</sup>               Even though in general the fashion discourse is stereotypical and               ethnocentric, it expresses genuine interest in the aesthetic value               contained in Native American cultural forms, and recognizes therein               art rather than ethnography in step with the new thinking. Just               compare &#147;Primitive American art collection&#148; and &#147;Made               in slate gray Georgette crepe, the wide bands incorporate all the               exquisite color sense of men who looked to Nature for all their               colorings.&#148;</p>            <p class="second">Rather than an antidote to industrial angst, the               adoption of Native American forms can be linked to a celebration               of machine technology and to the related question of Americanness,               a situation addressed in 1919 by Crawford:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> The exhibit in the Mallinson booth is in every                 detail essentially American. The silks have been woven and printed                 in the eight Mallinson mills in America, the designs have been                 created right here in America, and in many instances were inspired                 by American sources. In practically all instances, the designers,                 themselves American, have studied, dreamed and originated in American                 atmosphere.<sup>28</sup> </p>            </blockquote>            <p><span class="second">The stress on technology and Americanness               in design in general is understandable as a way to offset the economic               crisis brought about by the war and to bolster industry, which had               a positive influence in advancing the profession of designer, even               as it outdistanced handicrafts and created problems for labor.<sup>29</sup>               The striving in fashion to make something distinctly American produced               in number offered a needed alternative to the stratified world that               the Parisian couture represented, despite the fact that differences               in cost and status remained. But the mark was missed in not paying               more attention to the conditions of the users and not following               through to the fullest, when in the mid 1920s eyes turned again               toward Paris.<br>              <br>              What about the women outside of the Campfire Girls who knowingly               wore fashionable items indebted to Native American culture? Is this               an attempt to identify with Indians as Americans, a phase in the               construction of American femininity, a stance against Paris, or               a fashion expression? Are the four mutually exclusive? I will follow               the lead of Deloria in recognizing a paradoxical relationship concerning               national identity, American Indians and fashion design to end with               the mental image of white girls at play dressed up like &#147;Indian               braves&#148;.<sup>30</sup> <br>              </span> </p>            <p><a href="donah_notes.html">Notes<font class="second">&gt;&gt;</font>               </a></p>            <p><a href="donah_bio.html">Author's Bio<font class="second">&gt;&gt;</font>               </a></p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>          <td width="31">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Mary Donahue<i>. </i>All Rights Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
