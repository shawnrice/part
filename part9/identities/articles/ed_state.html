In light of new understandings about the writing               of history, it is important to draw attention to the term &#147;American&#148;               when applied to the United States as the sole representative of               the Americas. However much we recognize the broader issues raised               in its use, the term remains applicable and used in these essays.               The topic and time period were influenced by areas of our own research               in art history. Although the recent literature has expanded, much               more attention is needed, particularly outside the parameters of               the &#147;modern&#148; discourse surrounding developments in European               art, architecture and design to subsequently include the United               States&#146; abundant visual culture in all its depth and diversity.               The examples we investigate concern illustration, fashion, design,               and historiography, in addition to &#147;high art&#148;. These art               related articles combine with studies in the fields of anthropology,               history, musicology, philosophy and political science. This multidisciplinary               approach promises a greater scope and understanding of the goal               of self-definition during a complex period in American history,               often misunderstood because of sweeping generalizations and oversimplifications               in the literature.</p>            <p><br>              Our aim is not to present an authoritative account of the period,               but rather to encourage a further inquiry, not only for the time               in question, but to our present historical moment. Rethinking the               way we discuss &#147;American&#148; history and plotting out narratives               of national identity help us to grasp issues pertaining to what               it means to be an &#147;American&#148; since September 11, 2001.               At the recent Islamic North American Annual Conference, Akbar Ahmed,               Islamic Studies Chair at American University, asked how scholars               could encourage the idea of a dialogue between Islam and the United               States. He stressed the symbolism contained in images that shape               concepts and ideas and their role in repairing the damage that exists               between these two cultures. Might not a reflection upon the past               set the stage for how we want to define ourselves now as a nation?             </p>            <p><br>              The United States during the late 1910s and 1920s held great promise               for the future even as it dealt with issues that we confront today.               Heightened patriotism, political and economic dominion, xenophobia,               immigrant deportation, censorship, infringements of civil liberties,               tensions between nature and technology, and securing a role in the               global community similarly framed the period during and immediately               following World War I. Against this back drop individuals embraced               the country&#146;s diversity, challenged injustice, respected the               past and fostered creative and economic growth in the search for               defining national forms of expression.</p>            <p><br>              The articles are arranged in chronological order, albeit loosely,               not because this is the best way to write a history, but because               the essays are incomplete as a representative example, making a               thematic approach misleading. Rather the selections lend themselves               to the tracking of patterns, which could prove helpful in mapping               relationships for further study. <br>              In &#148;Refracting History: Ives and Emerson and the Nineteenth-Century               European Tradition in America&#148;, Christopher Bruhn examines               the field of art music through Charles Ives, whose major compositions               span the 1910s. Although aspiring composers typically studied in               Europe, Ives chose to remain in this country, where he attended               Yale. American aesthetics in the form of ragtime, hymnals, and marching               band tunes join with European traditions to create a vibrant new               sound. In his music, Ives, who was conscious of his American identity,               is compared to Emerson in their mutual goal of Americanizing European               models. Bruhn focuses on Ives&#146;s Piano Sonata No. 2, &#147;Concord,               Mass., 1840-1860&#148; whose four movements are named after Transcendental               writers &#150; Emerson, Hawthorne, The Alcotts and Thoreau. Perhaps               conceived as early as 1909 and completed by 1920, the sonata indicates               the continued relevance of nature to the American experience, while               at the same time embracing the modern in American vernacular music.</p>            <p><br>              Anne Woo-Sam&#146;s article, &#147;Americanizing Californians: Americanization               in California from the Progressive Era through the Red Scare&#148;,               focuses on the California immigration program set up in 1913. This               article highlights the importance of regional studies to arrive               at a fuller understanding of national identity. In the past, scholars               of immigration history tended to focus on the city of New York,               but The Commission of Immigration in Housing (CCIH), spearheading               the state of California&#146;s program, has a history of its own.               Woo-Sam illuminates the &#147;culturally liberal&#148; aspects of               CCIH efforts to shape new Americans as well as instruct native-born               citizens in their duties toward would-be citizens. Not only does               the treatment of immigrants have a direct parallel to today&#146;s               circumstances, but in addition, CCIH directives helped shape a favorable               U.S. image abroad. </p>            <p><br>              &#147;A Crisis of Identity: The Panama-Pacific International Exposition,               1915&#148; by Susan Luftschein examines the subject of international               expositions, which historically have asserted the interests and               technology of nations. Intended to celebrate the opening of the               Panama Canal, this fair, which was held in San Francisco, represented               U.S. technological prowess based on the engineering achievement               embodied in the canal. Ironically, even as World War I loomed large,               the official theme was global peace and harmony. Luftschein notes               contrasting styles and iconography in the fair&#146;s art, architecture               and design that suggest a crisis in U.S. identity on the cusp of               dramatic political, intellectual, cultural and economic changes.               This article gives us pause to consider the power of visual culture               to influence perceptions about being American.</p>            <p><br>              In &#147;Modern American Fashion Design American Indian Style&#148;,               Mary Donahue explores the Americanization of design through the               paradigm of fashion. This article examines the conception of an               American fashion in response to the erosion of ties with Paris as               a result of the war. Focusing on the alliance between New York museums               and the feminine apparel industry, beginning around 1917, the article               brings the business, economic and creative side of design into a               history of national identity. Native American art formed an important               part of New York collections. In analyzing their role in shaping               an American fashion we meet with the concurrent and ongoing practice               of white people dressing up as Indians in a search for true &#147;Americanness&#148;.             </p>            <p><br>              Antoinette Galotola&#146;s &#147;Expanding The American Experience:               The Liberator 1918-1924&#148; explores the American radical experience               through a study of the graphic art and editorial policy of the Liberator,               a left-wing American monthly. The artists, guided by a deeply committed               social consciousness primarily preserved the American realist tradition               in order to effectively communicate to the masses. It raises important               issues that shaped the period, which include the artists&#146; response               to social and political events immediately following World War I,               the often overlooked significance of magazines, journals and newspapers               to influence the general public, and the redefinition of American               identity in response to international political events, most notably               the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. </p>            <p><br>              In &#147;John Dewey&#146;s Philosophy, American-Style 1910-1929:               On How Philosophy Was Made American&#148;, Jonathan Lang shows that               the philosopher John Dewey reflected upon problems of moral and               social life in a way regarded by him and subsequent scholars as               distinctly home-grown. Dewey was extremely conscious of being American               and his thinking was guided by principles of relatedness among the               diverse peoples comprising the U.S. In contrast to the hierarchies               informing ethical models of European origin, he aimed at healing               relationships through &#147;intelligence&#148; characterized by               observation, theorizing and experimentation, in keeping with the               contemporary priority of science and social consciousness. Lang               wonders if we can get back to a vision of democracy embraced by               Dewey when faced with the wave of patriotism, which steers us away               from serious problems of difference, labor and the environment.</p>            <p><br>              &#147;Fifteen Years After: Matthew Baigell&#146;s &#145;American               Art and National Identity; the 1920s&#146; &#147; by Jane Necol               revisits a seminal article in American art historical scholarship.               Necol discusses Baigell&#146;s overview of certain tendencies and               ideas in the art world motivated by the goal of developing an American               aesthetic. While acknowledging Baigell&#146;s contribution to a               period and topic until recently largely disregarded by historians               of American art, she calls attention to the limits posed by Baigell               at a time when new scholarship was well advanced. Necol reminds               us that issues of national identity far exceeded a white male perspective               and that &#147;America&#148; constituted more than the United States.               This article sheds light not only on the 1910s and 1920s, but also               on current thinking concerning an intellectual history of U.S. national               identity.</p>            <p><br>              This project benefited from the encouragement, insights and editing               of Jonathan Lang (see essay and book review in this issue).</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>          </td>          <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>        </tr>        </tbody>       </table>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=top align="right">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign=bottom>       <div align="center"><a href="../../index.html"><img src="http://part-archive.finitude.org/part9/GR/PARTHOME.GIF" width="69" height="44" border="0" alt="Home"></a>       </div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td valign=bottom>&nbsp;</td>    <td colSpan=4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" class="seventh">&copy;       2003 P<i>ART </i>and Mary Donahue and Antoniette Galotola<i>. </i>All Rights       Reserved.</font> </td>  </tr>  </tbody> </table></body></html>
