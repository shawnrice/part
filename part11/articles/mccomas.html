Nevertheless,                   in reality, a strong dichotomy between city and country characterized                   Germany in the 1920s, and Romanticism remained a pervasive,                   though subtle, force in German art. For German artists living                   in the post-World War I era, struggling to come to terms with                   the war&#8217;s mass death and destruction and adapting to an                   increasingly industrialized society, the idealism of Romanticism                   was attractive. Photographs of plants and nature from the Weimar                   years seem to reflect this lingering undercurrent of Romanticism.                   Plants are not inherently urbane or modern, and their organicism                   seems at odds with technological modernity. Nevertheless, images                   of plants and nature figure prominently in the work of several                   important German photographers of the twenties. Karl Blossfeldt&#8217;s                   elegant images of magnified flowers remain popular to this day,                   but the nature photography of Albert Renger-Patzsch, less well                   known in the United States, also merits close study. Throughout                   his career, Renger-Patzsch demonstrated a strong interest in                   nature. In the 1920s, he published two books devoted to nature                   photography&#8212;Orchideen and Crassula&#8212;as part of the                   Folkwang Publishing House&#8217;s series Die Welt der Pflanze                   (The World of Plants), and articulated his thoughts on the topic                   in a 1924 essay, Photografieren von Bl&uuml;ten (Flower Photography).[2]                   Despite his adherence to a modernist formal language&#8212;his                   almost fetishistic attention to objects and surfaces immediately                   brings the work of Edward Weston to mind&#8212;his images, as                   will be suggested in this article, are firmly rooted in the                   tradition of German Romanticism. In particular, his work, like                   that of his nineteenth-century Romantic predecessors, conveys                   the Kantian concept of the Sublime.</p>                <p> Albert Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s object-oriented work shares                   affinities with the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity or New                   Sobriety) style of realist painting that arose in Weimar Germany                   as a reaction against the spiritual and anti-bourgeois tendencies                   of pre-war Expressionism.[3] Although the term Neue Sachlichkeit                   is applied to an exceptionally diverse and geographically dispersed                   group of artists, Neue Sachlichkeit paintings, in general, are                   crisply focused, highly detailed, and often emotionally detached.                   Rarely, however, was Neue Sachlichkeit art purely naturalistic                   or objective; indeed, it is sometimes characterized as &#8220;magical                   realism,&#8221; a term that acknowledges the Romantic content                   apparent in some of the imagery. Though photography was touted                   as objective, photographers achieved visions of a &#8220;magical&#8221;                   or slightly off-kilter world through the employment of extreme                   angles, close-ups, tight cropping, and sharp focus.[4] In Albert                   Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s book of photographs Die Welt ist sch&ouml;n                   (The World is Beautiful), published in 1928, images of plants                   and panoramic landscapes appear alongside images of factories                   and machines. Taken in the Ruhr district, Germany&#8217;s most                   industrialized region at the time, the photographs decontextualize                   their subjects by emphasizing the shapes, surfaces, and formal                   similarities of disparate objects.[5] But although the region                   where Renger-Patzsch lived was home to heavy industry, the book                   by no means privileged industry over nature. Indeed, nature                   and industry appear opposed to each other in Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s                   photographs of the landscape and towns of the Ruhr district,                   some of which appeared in Die Welt ist sch&ouml;n. Far from                   presenting a &#8220;beautiful world,&#8221; these images depict                   the devastation of a once pristine agricultural environment                   by the factories and smokestacks looming on the horizon. These                   landscapes do not suggest the excitement of the Sublime, but                   rather, bring to the fore the old Romantic notion of the antagonism                   between city and countryside, particularly through their juxtaposition                   with the aesthetically enticing images of nature found elsewhere                   in the book.[6] And although Renger-Patzsch relied on a modernist                   formal language in his depictions of nature, his photographs                   of archetypal plants glorify nature in a way that recalls nineteenth-century                   Romantic paintings, in which artists infused the landscape with                   a sense of divinity. Caspar David Friedrich&#8217;s Cross in                   the Mountains of 1807-08 is a classic example.</p>                <p> As demonstrated by Robert Rosenblum in his pioneering study,                   Modern Painting and the Northern Romantic Tradition: Friedrich                   to Rothko, Romanticism did not only capture the imagination                   of artists throughout Germany in the early nineteenth century,                   but persisted well into the twentieth century. The depiction                   of nature took on prime importance within the Romantic movement,                   becoming a surrogate for traditional Christian symbolism for                   artists disenchanted with the seemingly hollow rituals of the                   Church.[7] Early nineteenth-century Romantic painters, such                   as Caspar David Friedrich and Philippe Otto Runge, endowed nature                   with transcendental and divine qualities in their work. As a                   German artist employed in the art academy of Essen, Renger-Patzsch                   would have found it difficult to escape the legacy of Friedrich,                   Runge, and the scores of Symbolist and Expressionist artists                   who followed in the footsteps of the Romantics.</p>                <p> Romantic artists wishing to express a sense of divinity within                   nature, and needing intellectual guidance, had turned to Edmund                   Burke&#8217;s influential treatise of 1756, Philosophical Enquiry                   into the Origins of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful                   or the philosopher Immanuel Kant&#8217;s Observations on the                   Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime of 1764 and Critique                   or Judgment of 1790. Collectively, these works emphasize the                   idea that a sublime landscape is one that inspires terror or                   awe&#8212;and simultaneous delight&#8212;through its sheer immensity                   and power.[8] For artists and philosophers of the pre-industrial                   Romantic age in Germany, natural phenomena such as waterfalls,                   gorges, and mountains became emblematic of the vastness and                   awesomeness of the Sublime. The experience of the Sublime was                   perceived of as a strongly emotional, or even religious, experience                   that could remind humans of their inconsequentiality in the                   face of nature&#8217;s power. Due to the pervasiveness of Romantic                   thought, this &#8220;cult of nature&#8221; was well established                   in Germany by the 1920s. Idealization of nature provided a foil                   to the urban utopia promised by modern technology and entertainment.                   During the Romantic era, the notion of spiritual communion with                   nature became a theme in painting, often through the use of                   the Sublime aesthetic. Later nineteenth-century social movements,                   such as nudism and vegetarianism, the youth movement,[9] and                   the development of garden suburbs, reinforced the notion that                   a life lived in close contact with nature was both physically                   and morally healthy. Indeed, the emphasis on industry and urbanism                   in Weimar culture can be misleading, as the majority of the                   population continued to reside in small towns and rural villages                   during the 1920s.[10] Nevertheless, industry and the metropolis                   were fast encroaching upon rural villages, as can be seen in                   Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s photographs of the Ruhr district. The                   reality of industrial development made his nature photography                   appear all the more sublime and fantastic.</p>                <p> Writings by Burke and Kant, though obviously important for                   the development of Romantic aesthetics, were products of the                   Enlightenment. As such, they stress humanity&#8217;s psychological                   need to control the unknown and to devise rational ways of understanding                   the incomprehensibility of the Sublime. Edmund Burke, for example,                   argued that the Sublime was best contemplated from a distance.                   One could safely meditate upon the enormity of nature when it                   was presented in the form of a painting. The viewer could mentally                   enter the space of the painting and contemplate sublime nature                   while physically removed from it.[11] Regarding our reactions                   to the Sublime, Kant explained that when confronted with a sense                   of incomprehensible enormity or microscopic smallness, the viewer                   summons his or her mental powers of reason to rationalize and                   comprehend the previously unimaginable image or concept.[12]                   To facilitate the viewer&#8217;s comprehension of and delight                   in a sublime landscape, artists could impose a geometric order                   or other organizational structure&#8212;through perspective                   or other formal means&#8212;on the composition. The ability                   to suggest the irrationality of the world, while clearly controlling                   or domesticating it through visual means, would have continued                   to appeal to artists working within the sober, serious framework                   of Neue Sachlichkeit in the 1920s.</p>                <p> Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s close-up photographs of nature exemplify                   the concept of the Sublime and our control of it through formal                   artistic means. He routinely puts the viewer face to face with                   defamiliarized, and even terrifying, images of nature. One such                   example, Natternkopf (Snake&#8217;s Head) of 1925 (fig. 1),                   is a photograph that evokes the Sublime within a modernist formal                   context. The snake is an archetypal emblem of danger, and the                   extreme close-up employed by Renger-Patzsch magnifies the sense                   of horror and danger as the viewer is directly confronted with                   the enlarged eye of the snake. Yet, through careful composition                   and close cropping, Renger-Patzsch simultaneously succeeds in                   transforming the snake&#8217;s coiled body into a geometric                   structure of concentric patterns; as the viewer becomes absorbed                   in the complex design created by the snake&#8217;s scales, the                   reptilian eye in the center of the image becomes less threatening.                   The snake seems simultaneously larger than life and under our                   control, as we mentally come to terms with the form of the image.                   Indeed, as Kari Elise Lokke suggests in her study of Kantian                   aesthetics, &#8220;it is possible to be impelled to an awareness                   of one&#8217;s superiority to physical nature, and to awaken                   to the sublimity of the human mind which is, according to Kant,                   beyond the sphere of nature.&#8221;[13]</p>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="128"><img src="images/mccomas1.jpg" width="400" height="295"></td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                  <tr>                     <td class="maintext">Fig. 1.

Romantic painters expressed                   a great interest in depicting nature faithfully and with scientific                   clarity. Indeed, Goethe considered scientific accuracy the key                   to the success of a landscape painting.[14] Yet in the work                   of artists like Runge and Friedrich, hyper-realistic, scientific                   rendering was nearly always a means of elevating nature to a                   mythical or larger-than-life status. For the German Romantics                   of the early nineteenth century, science had not yet acquired                   negative connotations based on its association with the dehumanizing                   effects of industry and the mechanization of society. Science                   was considered a humanistic endeavor, compatible with Romantic                   ideals in the early nineteenth century. The pursuit of knowledge                   for its own sake was valued, and science was seen as a useful                   aid to aesthetics. Photographers in the 1920s, of course, had                   witnessed how industry made possible the mechanized slaughter                   of World War I. Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s defamiliarized images                   of nature may well have functioned on one level as an attempt                   to reinvest the world with a sense of magical innocence.</p>				<table width="495" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="298"><img src="images/mccomas2.jpg" width="297" height="400"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="173" class="maintext">Fig. 2.

Like                   Snake&#8217;s Head, Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s photography of trees                   evokes the Sublime, partly through their compositional similarities                   to specific Romantic paintings. Das B&auml;umchen (The Little                   Tree) of 1929 (fig. 2) bears an unmistakable resemblance to                   Friedrich&#8217;s Der einsame Baum (The Lone Tree) of 1822,                   now in Schlo&szlig; Charlottenburg in Berlin. Both the painting                   and the photograph present a single tree in the foreground,                   centered in the composition, clearly delineated, and sharply                   focused. Beyond each tree lies a vast landscape that stretches                   into the far distance, suggesting the sublimity of infinite                   space. Yet, in each image, our eye is continually drawn back                   to the foreground tree, which acts an as anchor in each composition                   so we are not overwhelmed by the vast landscape. Renger-Patzsch                   also photographed in the woods; in contrast to images such as                   The Little Tree, these photographs are small windows into hidden,                   enclosed spaces of dense vegetation. The evocative Woods in                   November of 1934 shows a cluster of silhouetted trees emerging                   from the leaf-carpeted forest floor. It is a scene of silence                   and mystery, removed from the realm of historical time. Its                   mood is similar to the gloomy, meditative atmosphere of works                   such as Friedrich&#8217;s The Abbey in the Oak Forest of 1810,                   a mysterious image in which bare trees frame a Gothic ruin.                   Both images fade into the mist, which veils the forest, allowing                   us to imagine it as endless and timeless. The romanticization                   of nature in Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s photographs, and his frequent                   emphasis on small fragments of nature, was described in the                   critic Carl Georg Heise&#8217;s 1928 preface to Die Welt ist                   sch&ouml;n. Heise explained that:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p> A close-up of a single tree can&#8230;conjure up the same                     intensive atmosphere of sylvan nature as the picture of densely                     packed trunks. The fact that a fragment can symbolize the                     whole, and that enjoyment and empathy are mutually exalting                     when the imagination is forced to collaborate in the experience&#8212;this                     is an area in which landscape photography offers a multitude                     of possibilities&#8230;These are pictures of the life of the                     earth in the sense of Caspar David Friedrich.[15]</p>                </blockquote>                <p> Thus, while the endless and the enormous reside at one end                   of the spectrum of the Sublime, microscopic smallness lies at                   the other. Highly detailed, quasi-scientific images of individual                   plants suggest this concept of incomprehensible minuteness.                   Romantic painters, in their careful renderings of plants, display                   empirical post-Enlightenment sensibilities, while also paying                   homage to their indigenous artistic heritage. German Romanticism                   revered the medieval and Renaissance culture of the Holy Roman                   Empire, and for Romantic artists, Albrecht D&uuml;rer and the                   landscapes by the sixteenth-century Danube School artists, such                   as Albrecht Altdorfer, had assumed an iconic status. D&uuml;rer&#8217;s                   carefully observed, magnified, and hyper-realistic studies of                   fragments of nature, such as the famous Great Piece of Turf                   of 1503, may have provided Romantic artists with inspiration                   in their quest to endow nature with spiritual vitality through                   faithful, scientific observation. For photographers, the view                   of the world through the camera lens illuminated details of                   nature that were inaccessible to the naked eye, yet they too                   drew on the model provided by D&uuml;rer. Renger-Patzsch made                   this clear in his 1925 essay Heretical Thoughts on Artistic                   Photography. He also expressed his preference for concentrating                   on small details of nature in this essay:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p> D&uuml;rer&#8217;s watercolour of a stag-beetle will always                     send art lovers into raptures. Therefore we need not be so                     timid in our choice of subjects, but how we reproduce it is                     what matters. A tuft of grass or the rosette of the greater                     plantain family is just as interesting to me as the fantastic                     forms of the dwarf fir&#8230;The high verticals of conifers                     yield images, just as do the wonderfully branch-like structures                     of tree moss, which I can also depict.[16]</p>                </blockquote>                <p> His obsession with these small fragments of nature was clearly                   articulated the previous year, in his essay, Photografieren                   von Bl&uuml;ten, in which Renger-Patzsch noted that to photograph                   plants and flowers, &#8220;one is forced to look, as it were,                   with the eyes of insects&#8221; in order to discover a microscopic                   world of &#8220;fantastic beauty.&#8221;[17]</p>                <table width="494" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="285"><img src="images/mccomas3.jpg" width="283" height="391"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="185" class="maintext">Fig. 3.

In his photographs,                   plants are often&#8212;as in D&uuml;rer&#8217;s studies&#8212;removed                   from their botanical context and set against a blank background,                   which both decontextualizes and aestheticizes them. Besides                   isolating the plants in this fashion, Renger-Patzsch severely                   cropped the images and used a sharp focus to illuminate the                   shape, textures, and patterned surfaces of the flowers with                   extraordinary clarity. In many examples, such as Sempervivum                   Tabulaeforme of 1922 (fig. 3), Renger-Patzsch employs such extreme                   enlarging and cropping that no background is visible at all.                   Instead, the surface of the flower fills the entire composition.                   Lacking context, the magnified image of the flower can initially                   disorient the viewer. The plant is defamiliarized and abstracted                   to the point where it is almost unrecognizable as a flower.                   Indeed, the patterning on its surface bears a distinct resemblance                   to the scales of the snake in Snake&#8217;s Head (fig. 1). This                   formalist, decontextualizing, aesthetic approach&#8212;characterized                   by the visual comparison of two disparate objects&#8212;exemplifies                   what Renger-Patzsch referred to as &#8220;joy before the object,&#8221;                   and also transports these images to the realm of the Sublime.</p>                <p> The extreme enlargement of minute details of flowers, animals,                   and landscapes transcends the boundaries of easily observable                   reality in Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s images, forcing the viewer                   to rethink his or her visual preconceptions. These photographs                   allowed people to see fragments of nature that they could never                   have seen without the aid of modern technology. Within this                   modernist context, the camera became a tool for illustrating                   the Romantic notion of the Sublime. In the romantically-inclined                   words of Carl Georg Heise, the photographer (i.e. Renger-Patzsch)                   and his camera allowed ordinary people to &#8220;see anew the                   symbolism of the fullness of life itself, inexhaustible in all                   its parts.&#8221;[18] Although Renger-Patzsch may have originally                   conceived of these images within the spirit of scientific observation,                   they have thus become monumental archetypes of art and nature                   for their viewers and commentators. Michael Jennings writes                   of Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s plant photography that: &#8220;The                   intensity of these images, the glorification of the individual                   organic object, indeed, seems to lend to these plants a mythic                   status.&#8221;[19] Indeed, these images could illustrate Goethe&#8217;s                   notion of the Urpflanze, or archetypal organic prototype, from                   which he thought all organic development emanated.[20] Likewise,                   Romantic artists had depicted archetypal images of nature&#8212;rendered                   as scientifically as possible&#8212;in order to bestow a sense                   of divinity upon nature.</p>                <p> In the &#8220;age of mechanical reproduction,&#8221;[21] as                   Walter Benjamin characterized Weimar culture, Albert Renger-Patzsch                   used the camera to present images of the Sublime with a modernist                   vision. The aesthetics of his Neue Sachlichkeit style were ostensibly                   realist, but ultimately had their roots in Romantic nature imagery.                   The Romantics, in turn, had looked to the detailed, hyper-realist                   style of Albrecht D&uuml;rer and the evocatively overgrown landscapes                   of the Danube School for inspiration. Photo historian Ute Eskildsen                   writes that Renger-Patzsch, despite his scientific background,                   described reality in metaphysical terms, &#8220;attributing                   to photography an extension of our vision and understanding                   because with its help we are able to perceive aspects of the                   natural world which are inaccessible to the naked eye.&#8221;[22]                   Photographers in the 1920s were not necessarily concerned with                   providing surrogates for Christian symbolism through the veneration                   of nature, but instead, wished to romanticize and venerate nature                   for its own sake, and to suggest the magical and inexplicable                   qualities of the natural world that had fascinated the Romantics.                   Influenced by the Romantic legacy as well as modernist formalism,                   Albert Renger-Patzsch turned to quasi-scientific observation&#8212;framing                   his observation with the aid of the camera&#8217;s lens&#8212;to                   emphasize the Sublime beauty of his subject matter.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>                <p>1.

According to Jost Hermand, Neue Sachlichkeit represented                   an ideological viewpoint that rejected the spiritualism and                   idealism of artists and intellectuals in Wilhelmine Germany.                   The rise of an objective, almost photographic realist style                   in painting was, Hermand suggests, a response to the specific                   political, social, and economic concerns of Weimar Germany,                   a society in which middle-brow, bourgeois, consumer-oriented                   culture was becoming increasingly pervasive in the mid- to late-1920s.                   See: Jost Hermand, &#8220;Neue Sachlichkeit: Ideology, Lifestyle,                   or Artistic Movement?&#8221; in Dancing on the Volcano: Essays                   on the Culture of the Weimar Republic, Thomas W.

The term Neue Sachlichkeit was coined in 1925 on the                   occasion of a large exhibition in Mannheim, which presented                   the work of post-war German realist painters.

Many viewers admired Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s modernist-formalist                   approach to his subject matter, but Die Welt ist sch&ouml;n                   was harshly criticized by Marxist critic Walter Benjamin. Although                   Benjamin attacked Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s decontextualization                   of objects and aesthetic juxtaposition of unrelated images,                   his criticism was largely based on the book&#8217;s title, which                   he saw as reactionary. Ironically, it was Renger-Patzsch&#8217;s                   publisher who had insisted upon the title, correctly believing                   that it would appeal to the general consumer. Renger-Patzsch                   had wanted to call the volume Die Dinge (Things), a less subjective                   title.
