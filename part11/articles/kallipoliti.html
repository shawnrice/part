Nevertheless, when it appears, a necessity is created                   for its removal. In time and through the use and misuse of language,                   the word has ended up in signifying waste, impurity [ ] or any                   incongruous accumulation of disparate elements, pieces and material                   fragments. However the etymological origin [ ] of the word refers                   to a residual substance that emerges in transitional material                   stages, such as the process of melting a metal or the process                   of sedimentation of a liquid. Therefore, dross is unrelated                   to the natural decay of a material and the passage of time.                   It is by definition &#8220;the scum, recrement, or extraneous                   matter thrown off from metals in the process of melting&#8221;                   [ ] or &#8220;an alloy incidentally formed in the zinc-bath                   [ ], by the action of the zinc on the iron pot and iron articles                   dipped. (Wahl Galvanopl. Manip. 1884)&#8221; [ ].Then, dross                   as a material condition comes to signify more than an entropic                   landscape or a disparate accumulation of worthless materials.                   It depicts material derailment and the production of displaced                   matter. It reminds us, that pure operations of making, seem                   to belong to the sphere of impossibility.</p>                <p> The purpose of analyzing the ingredients and the properties                   of dross substance lies beneath the fascination of metamorphic                   materials. Dross may be an alchemical fiction and a phantom                   material condition, but at the same time it is a product, or                   better stated a by-product, of social reality, paraphrasing                   Donna Haraway, who denotes that &#8220;the boundary between                   science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion&#8221;                   [ ]. The intrinsic properties of dross substance are analyzed                   to serve as a medium for the comprehension of a cultural phenomenon                   of incidentally displaced matter that is automatically rendered                   meaningless and serves no purpose whatsoever. Based on the perception                   of material impurity, this paper will attempt to encompass the                   generative potential of obsolete objects and spaces, or in other                   words waste material that is displaced culturally or functionally                   from either its previous or its original identity.</p>                <p> The cultural fabric for this paper revolves around the material                   ramifications of unprecedented technological evolutions in communications                   that have irreversibly shifted our production and consumption                   modes during the past two decades [figure 2]. The technological                   evolutions in computer software and hardware that have been                   producing novel tools have been in parallel producing immense                   quantities of &#8216;techno-junk&#8217;, tons of purposeless                   and indestructible matter, almost impossible to dispose of.                   The past decade though, concerns related to waste streams have                   slightly shifted in their orientation. Waste is no longer an                   issue that relates solely to quantity. It now also relates to                   the intricacy of the waste matter and its material composition.                   With the advent of highly advanced manufacturing methods and                   processes, many products that are displaced from their original                   roles and reach quickly and unexpectedly the end of their useful                   lives, are highly complex in form and material composition,                   containing in parallel high amounts of embodied energy [figure                   3]. Electronic waste, known as e-waste, is the largest growing                   industry of waste in a global scale. The rates of computer obsolescence                   are so extreme that &#8220;in the year of 2005, one computer                   will become obsolete for every new one put on the market&#8221;                   [ ] [figure 4]. Alongside the numbers, a personal computer &#8220;contains                   over 1,000 different substances, many of which are toxic, and                   creates serious pollution upon disposal&#8221; [ ]. </p>                <p>Side by side to the waste derivative from the electronics industry,                   a mundane reality of big defunct objects &#8211; building displaced                   parts- is overwhelming the contemporary city. Techno-junk is                   an emerging city-born condition; Defunct oil tanks, air-conditioning                   tubes, advertising billboards, containers and other apparatuses                   articulate a new urban language that violates the building envelope                   or attaches itself to it as an outgrowth. If one identifies                   in the city fabric, a stratum of buildings that can be easily                   mapped due to their longevity, equivalently he could identify                   a stratum of mechanical appendages that cannot easily be mapped                   due to their &#8216;ephemerality&#8217;. The significantly different                   lifetime of the two strata is the cause for an erosion of the                   outer building shell that cannot adapt to the change, taking                   place in it or around it. The unmappable urban condition of                   this &#8220;floating matter&#8221; in the city has been yet                   unexplored by contemporary architecture. The necessity of such                   a discourse is not only driven by the formulation of an ecological                   awareness, but also by the need to manipulate this kind of raw                   material. Potentially, it could lead to an alternate practice                   of recycling, based on questions of matter, rather than on questions                   of representation.</p>                <p> The question arising is to what extent this phenomenon affects                   architectural design and in what manner. Obsolete and &#8216;nondisposable                   matter&#8217; is influential in diverse scales of reference                   such as the scale of an object &#8211;defunct computers-, this                   of a room &#8211;oil tanks, air conditioning tubes, containers                   etc.- and that of a building &#8211;partially abandoned buildings,                   &#8216;brownfields&#8217; etc. The content of this paper engages                   &#8216;obsolete matter&#8217; in various scales of reference,                   or &#8216;techno-excrements&#8217; as an emerging city-born                   condition, derivative of the urban system&#8217;s internal erosion.</p>                <p><strong> 02 &gt;&gt; Re-genesis of diverse matter _ post-praxis                   design strategies </strong></p>                <p>&#8220;&#8230; We think of Picasso&#8217;s bicycle seat (Bull&#8217;s                   Head) of 1944:</p>                <p>You remember that bull&#8217;s head I exhibited recently? Out                   of handle bars and the bicycle seat I made a bull&#8217;s head,                   which everybody recognized as a bull&#8217;s head. Thus a metamorphosis                   was completed; and now I would like to see another metamorphosis                   take place in the opposite direction. Suppose my bull&#8217;s                   head is thrown on the scrap heap. Perhaps some day a fellow                   will come along and say: &#8216;Why there&#8217;s something                   that would come in handy for the handle bars of my bicycle&#8230;&#8217;                   and so a double metamorphosis would have been achieved.&#8221;                   [ ]</p>                <p> By engaging a strategy of irony as a legitimate method of                   approaching phenomena, Colin Rowe &amp; Fred Koetter assert                   that there is no social or constructed reality &#8220;that we                   have to accept in toto&#8221; [ ], but a composite present realm                   consisted of fragments. A discourse of collaging fragments is                   ironic, because it resists utopia. It recognizes a &#8220;loss&#8221;                   in objects, buildings or urban domains that have misplaced their                   previous fixed identity and encompasses this condition as a                   generative potential. The significance of this citation, resides                   in its unique interpretation of meaning. Here, meaning is not                   an inscribed, static quality, embedded in objects. Conversely,                   it is a tacit, malleable status perpetually redefined, as the                   object is appropriated and reused, as it undergoes a metamorphosis.                   In this sense, the tactics of reuse is not solely an environmental                   strategy directed to the utopian idea of the world&#8217;s salvation.                   When dealing with meaning, reuse &#8220;fuels a reality of change,                   motion, action&#8221; [ ].</p>                <p> Then, the argument of reuse is not bonded merely to ethical                   and practical concerns. It is about manipulating the material                   aspect of an unprecedented flow in the urban fabric. Along the                   same lines of thought, the condition of flow and unremitting                   transformation is characterized by Kepes as a fundamental reorientation                   of the 20th century. He explains that &#8220;the dominant matrix                   of nineteenth-century attitudes was the use of Marx&#8217;s                   term &#8216;reification&#8217;; relationships were interpreted                   in terms of things, objects or commodity values. Today a reversal                   of this attitude has begun to appear; there is a steadily increasing                   movement in science and in art toward processes and systems                   that dematerialize the object world and discredit physical possessions.                   What scientists considered before as substance shaped into forms,                   and consequently understood as tangible objects, is now recognized                   as energies and their dynamic organization&#8221; [ ].</p>                <p> Extenuating the strategy of appropriation, reuse and transformation,                   dross praxis does not begin from scratch, but from the reality                   of an existing inoperative component; therefore, meaning is                   inevitably shifted. It can no longer be located in the process                   of representing an abstract concept, but in the act of manipulating                   matter and bonding new functions to objects that have lost their                   previous, fixed identity. Instead of a genesis of meaning, there                   is a regeneration of meaning and identity. A dross_ post-praxis                   dwells conceptually in what one could consider as the counterpart                   of parthenogenesis -the phenomenon of virgin birth. It emerges                   as a germinal creative drive, through the desire for transformation                   of existing information, concepts and physical entities; it                   engrafts a copiousness of thought or &#8220;a transformative                   vision&#8221; [ ], defying pure, virginal creations. If we assume                   that nothing emerges &#8216;out of zero&#8217;, a post-praxis                   aims to retain the energy induced in creative systems and exploiting                   the accumulative effect of knowledge and materiality.</p>                <p> Leaping to the pragmatics of the domain of material reuse,                   new issues have emerged in the past two decades, yet unresolved                   to a great extent. The case of a bottle, which would be the                   consumer by-product of the 70s, and that of a personal desktop                   are largely dissimilar as waste streams. Despite the fact that                   objects belong in the same category of scale, the material composition                   of a computer makes it recycling an excruciating and elusive                   task of shredding and segregating into constituent components                   and materials before the actual recycling process takes place.                   Consequently, there seems to be a necessity to use defunct circuitboards                   for instance, as larger ready-made complexes or components for                   entirely new uses. Such a practice is supported in few cases                   through the production of materials by recombinant methods and                   assemblies. Within this framework of thought, waste materials                   can be inserted within new materials, either as reinforcement                   or as ready-made components, yielding particular local behaviors                   relative to the performance of the new materials. In light of                   this technique, the notion of &#8216;downcycling&#8217; becomes                   relevant to the next use and ceases to depend on the &#8216;performative&#8217;                   properties of the new material. Recombinant assemblies stipulate                   material crossbreeding as a strategy for &#8216;upcycling&#8217;.                   Along the lines of this argument Sheila Kennedy remarks how                   &#8220;secondary and tertiary methods of post-industrial production                   produce recombinant materials: materials within materials&#8230;                   The most inexpensive pressboards are made from the waste scraps                   of the rarest woods. These claddings products confound the representational                   hierarchies of front, back, exterior and interior, and are equally                   acceptable as substrates or finish materials&#8221; [ ]. Recycled                   ground cover [figure 5] and Alkemi constitute such examples                   of &#8216;recombinant assembly&#8217; materials. The former                   is a &#8220;loose-fill groundcover derived from 100% recycled                   vulcanized rubber from whole passenger and/or truck tires&#8230;                   held in place due to the interlocking properties of rubber&#8221;                   [ ]. The latter is a &#8220;solid surface material made by blending                   salvaged aluminum chips or other non-ferrous metal waste with                   a silica fiber and pigments, bonded with a polyester resin&#8221;                   [ ]. </p>                <p><strong>03 &gt;&gt; Historic Synthesis of material reuse _                   </strong></p>                <p> Material reuse is certainly not a new territory of exploration.                   Locally found materials in nature and materials recovered from                   deceased animals, such as whale and mammoth bones [ ], were                   used directly for shelter and weaponry in prehistoric times.                   Up to the twentieth century, recycling was more of a technical                   exploitation of recourses or an incidence, rather than a cognitive                   strategy of material reuse. The falls of empires often succeeded                   recycling of the materials of buildings; this act was bonded                   to the disconnection of buildings from their cultural and monumental                   significance that were consequently used as &#8216;quarries&#8217;.                   Alongside acts of &#8216;quarrying&#8217;, in the construction                   of tombs in ancient Rome, entire objects were reused, such as                   pots and carafes, in a repetitive manner to form shells or vaults.                   A characteristic example is the &#8220;fourth century Roman                   tomb on the Via Apia, which was dubbed &#8216;pigna terra&#8217;                   in honor of its dome built of clay pots&#8230; We are familiar                   with the dome of hollow jugs of the orthodox baptistry in Ravena                   which was begun in 400 BC and finished 50 years later&#8221;                   [ ]. In the cases of these tombs, construction was instigated                   by an assembly line of ready-made components, which discloses                   ground for a different perspective of material reuse, potentially                   not directly linked to technical parameters of recourse extractions.                 </p>                <p>With a massive time gap, the issue of reuse has reemerged,                   monumentally appealing, as an offspring of rapidly advancing                   industrialized processes. Mechanical reproduction was critically                   questioned by artists and literary critics of the beginning                   of the twentieth century, such as Walter Benjamin and Fernard                   Leger. Marcel Dunchamp&#8217;s declaration of the urinal as                   a work of art, emancipated a syllogism that disconnected the                   reminiscence an object was carrying along with it from its materiality.                   The object could then be viewed as &#8216;raw material&#8217;                   utilized for further spatial deployments. In parallel, one of                   the main representatives of the Dada movement, Kurt Schwitters,                   gathered material from the street and collaged it to make artifices                   in the interior of his apartment, in order to create the compelling                   work of the Hanover &#8216;Merzbau&#8217; in Germany [ figure                   6]. Schwitters&#8217; declaration was to build out of nothing                   &#8211;merz-, meaning out of displaced material that experiences                   a loss of identity. The importance of Schwitters&#8217; artwork                   extends to the techniques of deploying the material he collected.                   He did not simply put it together in an additive manner. Instead,                   he created a second smooth membrane that sealed the realm of                   collage. Eventually, the compositions of the prosthetic art                   became latent building material, where points of local interest                   revealed through openings called &#8216;grottos&#8217;. Schwitters&#8217;                   wrapping of his collected waste material depicts two fundamentally                   different principles that constitute simultaneously bipolar                   and inherent drives in creative praxis. These principles are                   collage and molding, where the first denotes an additive logic                   of juxtapositions and superimpositions and the latter denotes                   a procedural, evolving logic of transfusion.</p>                <p> &#8220;By the late sixties it started becoming obvious that                   continual economic growth had its down side. As the booming                   consumer society mindlessly guzzled fossil fuels and raw materials,                   a counterculture arose whose participants sought a way back                   to their natural roots. These drop-outs from conventional society                   hoped to swap self-centered consumerism for an autonomous, communal                   lifestyle. Not surprisingly, the back-to-nature movement drew                   its most ardent support in the Western USA. They established                   whole villages of astonishing self-built structures. Inspiration                   for the building types and techniques appropriate to a self-supporting                   society came from the (not all that distant) pioneering past                   and from nomadic architecture&#8221; [ ] [ figure 7 ]. At that                   time, two parallel concerns arose. The former was related to                   increased urbanization rates and alarming demographic statistics,                   indicating massive population moves to urban centers which were                   already overpopulated and most of old structures were not fit                   for adequate living conditions. The latter concern was related                   to a consumer culture that was growing like a plague, leaving                   behind it more and more colossal amounts of physical waste and                   unused materials, given the fact that there were few if no strategies                   of reuse at that time. These two interests coalesced in a short-lived                   movement instigated by architects that attempted to seek solutions                   to the housing problem through the use of consumer waste materials.                 </p>                <p>Frederic Migayrou refers to this historic moment as a time                   of &#8220;simultaneous origin for urbanism and ecology&#8221;                   [ ]. The merging of the housing predicaments with the potential                   derived by recycling consumer products was functioning in accordance                   to laws of nature and metabolism. As natural systems recycle                   their wastes, the hope of recycling by-products of urban environments                   became prominent bringing to the foreground a naturalistic perspective,                   diffusing positivist connotations. Apparently frustrated with                   consumerism and housing issues, architects joined the two themes                   under an aborning umbrella of &#8216;artificial ecology&#8217;                   and launched a new movement in the 70s of garbage reuse, often                   referred to as &#8216;garbage architecture&#8217; [ figure 8                   ]. Although, these architects through their subversive work                   were performing some form of social critique, it should be noted                   that their ideas were in accordance with the conceptual main                   streams under the generic prism of &#8220;an organic model of                   life that came to the fore. As one can see from the theoretical                   works of the Chicago School: The Town; A Natural Phenomenon;                   The Urban Phenomenon as a Way of Life; Expansion as Physical                   Growth, the town became a physical entity, a constantly changing                   organism that should be studied in vivo with the same methodology                   as that which dealt with the ecosystems of nature&#8221; [ ].                 </p>                <p>Guided by the belief that &#8220;one man&#8217;s pollution                   can be another man&#8217;s housing&#8221; [ ], &#8220;garbage                   architects&#8217; began experimenting with various materials                   that had no essential value and were in a state of &#8216;oblivience&#8217;                   as industrial by-products. More specifically, Witold Rybczynski                   in Canada experimented with sulphur and attempted to find a                   use for it as a building material. He recorded that &#8220;in                   Alberta, at the present time (1973), 9 million tons of sulphur                   were stockpiled &#8230; Sulphur could be considered to have                   virtually no value and was, in effect, an industrial waste&#8230;                   Sulphur also occured as sulphides and sulphates of metals and                   was a by-product of mining operations&#8221; [ ] [ figure 9].                   At the same time, Martin Pawley headed a research program at                   Cornell University in collaboration with the municipality of                   Santiago in Chile. The research program concerned &#8220;the                   possible value of garbage housing in the context of the explosive                   urbanization of the Santiago region. This research was carried                   out at Cornell University in the Spring of 1973&#8221; [ ].                   Their goal was to produce housing solutions with the use of                   extant obsolete material in the regions of Santiago, especially                   consumer by-products. They were thoroughly examining ways in                   which to create links between packaging-container industries                   and building industries in order to achieve what Martin Pawley                   has called a &#8220;parasitic housing policy&#8221; [ ]. Finally,                   &#8220;the two Cornell prototypes were experimental structures                   built using cans, bottles and corrugated cardboard&#8230; The                   second house, a scale model of Le Corbusier&#8217;s Maison de                   Weekend was designed by David Montanari and Warren Lee. It featured                   walls of hand-corrugated sandwich panels devised by David Ross,                   and vaulted roof sections using large numbers of soft drink                   and beer cans as voussouirs&#8221; [ ]. </p>                <p>At the end of the decade in May 1979, &#8220;the first International                   Conference of Garbage Architects was held at Florida A&amp;M                   University and examined &#8216;junk&#8217; as a problem and                   a solution&#8221; [ ]. However, hints of frustration had already                   risen from the movement&#8217;s main advocates. Their sincere                   attempts to seek pragmatic solutions for the growing housing                   problems faced immense impediments by the building industry,                   which was functioning in a closed-loop of linear productivity                   and could not act as a receptor for by-products of other industries.                   On top of this impediment, with the technology available at                   the time, it was excruciatingly difficult to use by-products                   in such a manner in order to produce quality housing, fulfilling                   technical standards of insulation. In 1973, Martin Pawley confessed                   that &#8220;to serve redesigned packaging into this machine                   (referring to the building industry) as a low cost building                   material is to submit to a process of alchemy in reverse; the                   outcome will be costly, scarce and irrelevant&#8230; any attempt                   to introduce a revolutionary new strategy&#8230; must not only                   develop outside the present structure of the building industry,                   but inside the mainstream of mass consumption itself&#8221;                   [ ]. Seeing through the overt parameters that have instigated                   garbage housing to flourish under the cultural conditions of                   the 70s, one has to note that the &#8216;fuzzy logic&#8217;                   of this subversive idea was accompanied by a lack of charm or                   appeal that would be a prerequisite to sustain the utopic discourse.                   &#8216;Garbage architects&#8217; were guided solely by their                   ethos and sense of grandiose responsibility of saving the world.                   However, not even they themselves were intrigued by their designs;                   they were quite frank about it as well. So along all the practical                   hindrances that lead to the fall of &#8216;garbage housing&#8217;,                   the lack of appeal was also a significant side factor.</p>                <p> Concurrently, at the beginning of the 70s, parallel interests                   in the creative use of diverse used materials found a more creative                   expression in art, channeled through the movement of &#8216;Arte                   Povera&#8217; in Italy. Although artists of this movement and                   &#8216;garbage architects&#8217; shared analogous tactics of                   material deployment in their work, their foundational logic                   and core concerns were extensively dissimilar. &#8216;Garbage                   architects&#8217; were geared by an environmental sensibility                   in response to distressing technical issues; on the other hand,                   &#8216;Arte Povera&#8217; artists were seeking manners to use                   &#8216;primordial matter&#8217; as a means of artistic expression,                   attempting to release themselves from the bonds of conventional                   representation techniques in painting, that was the dominant,                   if not exclusive, tradition in Italian art. As art critics note,                   the development of &#8216;Arte Povera&#8217; in Italy, &#8220;paralleled                   a broader international tendency (in the United States, the                   trajectory was through Pop Art, to Minimalism and Conceptual                   Art) in which the supremacy of painting was challenged from                   both the theoretical side and the practical side as artists                   found in sculpture an extraordinarily rich field of exploration&#8221;                   [ ]. </p>                <p>&#8220;The phrase arte povera first appeared in a text authored                   by a twenty-seven year old art critic named Germano Celant to                   accompany his exhibition Arte Povera e IM Spazio at Genoa&#8217;s                   Galleria La Bertesca in September 1967&#8221; [ ]. Celant identified                   the eminent cultural shift towards materiality in artistic production                   and gave a collective identity to 13 Italian artists who &#8220;had                   a diversity of exhibited work behind them, but at that moment,                   in the autumn of 1967, all shared a crystalline understanding                   of the marriage and concept of materials&#8221; [ ] [ figure                   10 ]. The term &#8216;Arte Povera&#8217; [Arme Kunst] is immediately                   translated as &#8216;poor art&#8217;. However, the emphasis                   does not reside exclusively in the use of worthless unused materials;                   it resides in the belief that &#8220;art could be made from                   anything: living things, products of the earth, and industrially                   produced materials, as well as immaterial substances such as                   moisture, sound and energy. Art could be made in any way. It                   could be painted, handcrafted, industrially produced, gestured,                   spoken, written, acted, dreamed&#8221; [ ] [ figure 11 ]. In                   this sense, the inherent entropy in matter is viewed as a generative                   force for the artists. They were urged to reveal the elemental                   nature of materials and release their properties through an                   open-ended experimentation, producing art. Art was not pre-conceptualized                   and consequently executed by the application of materials to                   already established concepts and ideas. On the contrary, these                   two parameters of the creative praxis were parallel investigations;                   &#8220;an interaction of work and material&#8221; [ ] [ figure                   12 ].. Moreover, &#8220;the shift was no longer from the object                   to the material in the pictorial sense, as with the Informale                   artists, but to a &#8216;brutally elementary material&#8217;,                   a physico-chemical presence that evokes the primordial&#8230;                   but the most striking aspect was the experimental juxtaposition                   of materials to create a strange encounter between the normal                   and the mythical, everyday life and art&#8230; Other critics                   went further by interpreting the work as a rearticulation of                   archetypes and myths of a &#8216;Mediterranean civilization&#8217;                   to be counterposed to the technological, rationalistic and materialistic                   civilization associated with the United States. Materials, in                   this framework, were made to carry a heavy baggage of political                   and ideological connotations&#8221; [ ]. </p>                <p>&#8220;In May 1972 Celant pulled the plug: When the Munich                   Kunstraum organized their exhibition [Arte Povera: 13 italienische                   Kunstler], he requested that the title of the show should not                   be &#8216;Arte Povera&#8217;, but the names of the individual                   artists&#8221; [ ]. Celant was primarily responsible for the                   fact that the group of the thirteen Italian artists gained a                   collective identity. He launched &#8216;Arte Povera&#8217; as                   a coherent cultural stasis in the production of art. His objection                   in 1972 to maintain this identity was also in opposition to                   the artists&#8217; will, who attempted for more than a decade                   to grasp from the communal potency of the movement. Gradually                   though, the effect faded and the artists pursued individual                   itineraries. Whatever the case, one has to note that the movement                   of &#8216;Arte Povera&#8217; has played a pivotal role in the                   production of art; a dense and compact instant in history of                   cultural resistance to form and generative potential of displaced                   matter. </p>                <p>Approximately twenty years later and in an entirely different                   arena of expertise, the group &#8216;Asymptote&#8217; has created                   a series of indefinite digital images &#8220;I_Scapes, B_Scapes                   &amp; M_Scapes&#8221; that have emerged from the digital manipulation                   of commercial objects designed in the computer [ figure 13 ].                   Prodding into a novel realm of &#8216;digital reuse&#8217;,                   their series did not encompass the direct application of obsolete                   materials, but instead involved the production and the reuse                   of virtual images that could then be manufactured. Common everyday                   objects such as shoes, car parts, wheels and others were introduced                   in the computer and manipulated through the use of digital media.                   The intrinsic logic of three-dimensional software tools became                   in this case a medium of open-ended exploration; a medium that                   has yielded unexpected results in comparison to direct material                   manipulations. Such an exploration discloses an alternate perception                   of matter that emerges from the use of a newly available tool.                   &#8220;The I. Scapes derived from the Asymptote&#8217;s reading                   of the effect of the computer on culture, with particular focus                   on new formations of meaning and a revised understanding of                   what now constitutes spatiality. Asymptote&#8217;s I.

They are instead continuous and fluid traces of                   uncanny resemblances. They fetishize mutation, distortion and                   delirium, forming spaces fused with image. The choreographed                   assemblies meander through channels of possibility and familiarity,                   arriving by chance at unforeseen orders &#8220; [ ].</p>                <p><strong> 04 &gt;&gt; Collage and Molding Operations _ Molding                   Case Studies</strong></p>                <p> The ground logic for a post-praxis of reuse seems to revolve                   around two fundamentally different principles that constitute                   in parallel both bipolar and necessary drives for any creative                   praxis. These principles are collage and moulding; where the                   first denotes an additive logic of juxtapositions and superimpositions                   and the latter denotes a procedural, evolving logic of transfusion.                 </p>                <p>In many cases of reuse, disparate obsolete parts were added                   either to different contexts or to other obsolete components.                   This syllogism of bringing fragments together and interrogating                   their newly formed relationships in new assemblages constitutes                   a prime artistic revolution for the twentieth century. Collage                   embeds the notion of reuse in an elemental sense. As a line                   of thought, it is founded on the acknowledgment that meaning                   fluctuates and cannot be resolutely engrafted into the physicality                   of objects at a specific moment in time. In this sense, collage                   is a practice that &#8220;violates &#8216;property&#8217; in                   every sense- intellectual property protected by copyright, and                   the properties of a given concept&#8221; [ ]. It is a kind of                   theft [ ]. Group Mu&#8217; s exegesis of collage is characteristic                   of the embedded logic of reuse and appropriation in the practice                   of collage. According to them, collage is &#8220;to lift a certain                   number of elements from works, objects preexisting messages,                   and to integrate them in a new creation in order to produce                   an original totality, manifesting ruptures of diverse sorts&#8230;                   Collage leads necessarily to a double reading: that of the fragment                   perceived in relation to its text of origin; that of the same                   fragment as incorporated into a new whole, a different totality.                   The trick of collage consists also of never entirely suppressing                   the alterity of these elements reunited in a temporary composition&#8221;                   [ ].</p>                <p> Although molding also involves the appropriation of existing                   objects and contexts, its case is vitally different. The obsolete                   matter is interrogated for its textural and formal potential                   and successively used either as a matrix or as material that                   can be plastically manipulated. Then the matrix is subjected                   to a process of many stages; a process that essentially feeds                   itself as molds and cats change roles in and out without a definitive                   ending. As Beatriz Colomina points out, molding &#8220;is a                   space to reveal its secrets, to show the unseen. This is no                   way a polite affair&#8230; Casting is an interrogation of space:                   violently pulling evidence out of it, torturing it, forcing                   a confession. If anything, casting approaches the supposedly                   benign but actually brutal techniques of medical inquiry and                   diagnosis, and the no less violent excavations and demolitions                   involved in psychoanalysis&#8221; [ ]. </p>                <p>By putting the two principles of collage and moulding, in opposition,                   one can draw the following assumptions: If collage signifies                   the change of context, then molding signifies a material transfer;                   if collage&#8217;s scope is a syntax change, then molding&#8217;s                   scope is a substance change; if the intrinsic principle of collage                   is prosthesis of parts, then the intrinsic principle in molding                   is fusion of parts; if collage is about transformation, molding                   is about transmutation. </p>                <p>For decades now, collage, as an analytical tool and a method                   of irony has been dominating the conduits of imagination in                   the creative praxis. Recent developments though in biology and                   informatics depict urges for a cultural shift towards new paradigms                   of thought. The wonders of genetic engineering, artificial skins,                   reflexive membranes and biosciences portray a shift from the                   mechanical paradigm. Genetic processes are structurally different                   from their machinic counterparts. They are not only distinguished                   because of their soft form, but also because of their origin,                   their production processes and their eventual integration to                   the body. This ground-breaking shift from the mechanical limb                   to the artificial organ or skin, due to our capacity to manipulate                   and eventually duplicate in different terms DNA, has conceptually                   infused diverse domains of thought and expression, including                   art, informatics, computation and architecture. </p>                <p>The words &#8216;mold&#8217;, &#8216;plasma&#8217; and &#8216;plastic&#8217;                   are etymologically related to the Greek word &#8216;&#960;____~&#960;_____&#8217;,                   which refers to a condition of material malleability and the                   manipulation of substance until a shape is given. Consequently,                   moulding differs significantly from collage as an operation,                   since it speaks of material transfusion and the search of perpetual                   transformation of matter. Using moulding in a broader sense                   here, it is used to describe not only &#8216;molds&#8217; used                   to produce inverse volumes in the conventional sculptural sense,                   but also to encompass a &#8216;plastic&#8217; use of material.                   Therefore, the &#8216;moulding&#8217; case studies that will                   be presented as follows refer to artistic and architectural                   endeavors where: i ] obsolete matter is used as a matrix or                   a &#8216;reproductive machine&#8217; for numerous by-products                   of an inoperative component ii ] an inoperative component or                   part is wrapped and encased by layers of different materials,                   leaving its imprint only as an internal volume.</p>                <p>[ Matias and Mateo Pinto &#8211; Caracas ]</p>                <p> Matias and Mateo Pinto, two young practicing architects in                   Caracas Venezuela, were assigned to build the La Vega Community                   Center in one of the poorest neighborhood in Caracas, in the                   course of &#8220;an ambitious plan to improve and formalize                   the squatter settlements &#8211;locally known as barrios- that                   occupy the city&#8217;s hillsides&#8221; [ ]. Pinto&#8217;s                   perspective in the upgrading of the area was one of strategic                   alliance of the new building and its surrounding environment;                   an integrative approach to both the structure and the materiality                   of the barrios in the city&#8217;s hillsides. Their building                   was designed in such a manner as to open itself to existing                   pathways and void spaces in various levels, both through its                   volumetric expression and through its accessibility. A significant                   concomitant concern though, was to use existing used materials                   as parts of the exterior envelope&#8217;s structure [ figure                   15 ]; &#8220;the building materials and techniques reflected                   the improvisational and opportunistic character of many barrios                   constructions&#8230; In a last minute decision by the architects,                   the in-situ casting utilized a textured plastic formwork from                   air-conditioning filters&#8221; [ ]. Although referred to as                   an unpunctual decision, the reuse of junk material that is floating                   around the hills is deeply associated with the culture of construction                   in the hills, where most building units are not necessarily                   composed of one unified material, but instead of various diverse                   components that are readily available and are attached to different                   surfaces. In this case, floating waste material becomes a mould                   for the production of new material and reflects the mercurial                   building conditions in the &#8216;barrios&#8217;.</p>                <p>[ Specht Harpman &#8211; New York ]</p>                <p> &#8220;Specht Harpman has developed a strategy for the mass                   appropriation into architecture of familiar, small-scale objects                   &#8211;from ice-cube trays to mineral water bottles- repetitively                   assembling them to create delirious, highly textured, colorful                   and ornamental surfaces. Specht Harpman uses the term &#8216;hypertexture&#8217;                   to describe the visual complexity generated by panels of these                   objects&#8221; [ ]. <br>                  Spechtman is interested in drilling a social critique on mass                   production culture and unveil a new approach to ornamental expression                   through the appropriation of packaging systems that apparently                   yield complexity when used as molds for repetitive tiles. In                   his designs, he does not seek to generate complexity through                   intricate thought patterns, but to find complexity in the formal                   presence of obsolete matter and expose it to the public. &#8220;This                   formal complexity of the individual containers is rationalized                   and subsumed through repetition into a visual field, a texture;                   but when viewed closely, it displays the geometric expressiveness                   of ornament &#8211;in this sense, created by repetitive absence,                   the negative impression of familiar consumer goods&#8221; [                   ]. </p>                <p>[ Lo/Tek &#8211;New York ]</p>                <p> In the case of the Lite-Gate project, Lo/Tek has used a plastic                   shipping pallet as a mold in order to create door panels. The                   interest in this project lies in the composition of the cast                   material, which fuses the liquid material of resin with electronic                   devices, micro-censors and neon tubes. The idea was the registration                   of entrance through the detection of movement by the censors                   and the consequent illumination of the panels. In parallel,                   the censors transmitted information to cameras, which recorded                   the people entering the apartment and projected the information                   in screens located in the interior of the apartment. Lo/Tek                   describe this project as &#8220;an illumination and surveillance                   device that marks the narrow corridor connecting two previously                   separate apartments. It recreates the experience of passing                   through a metal detector and acts as a luminous buffer between                   the outside world and the privacy of a home&#8221; [ ].</p>                <p>The reuse of the shipping pallet that is utilized as a reproductive                   matrix exceeds its conventional role in providing formal features                   for the panel by-product. Instead the electronics are embedded                   in the mold and the final panel product turns out to be a compact                   solid panel with wired cast substance. In this sense, new modes                   of conceiving casting are disclosed; approaches that are unrelated                   to &#8216;tiling&#8217; and decoration, but focus on the material                   composition of the mold yielding an enhanced performance.</p>                <p>[ Rachel Whiteread &#8211; London ]</p>                <p> Whiteread&#8217; s case is a particular one, since she casts                   obsolete spaces; entire parts of buildings illuminating the                   internal structure of their interior [ figure 18 ]. More specifically,                   she selects buildings that are meant to be demolished and are                   already abandoned and she casts their internal space as a trace,                   a memory. Whiteread&#8217; s work is one of revelation; by turning                   the void space into a solid block, she exposes that which is                   not seen, that which does not exist in our perception as a coherent                   entity. &#8220;Her casts stays content with the negative, the                   inversion, the conundrum&#8221; [ ]. Her materials have shifted                   significantly in time and in each given site, largely dependent                   on the texture that the mold has to bear as reminiscence of                   the obliterated space. By infusing different materials into                   large spaces in volume, her work moves ahead of the reproduction                   of a part used for tiling and stays aside from any interpretation                   relevant to decorative concerns. Instead her inverted cast spaces                   are giving volume and material to residual space, turning memory                   into a &#8216;solid block&#8217;. </p>                <p>[ Antony Gormley ]</p>                <p> Antony Gormley has created an art series of diverse objects,                   each encased in a singular material, entitled &#8216;Natural                   Selection&#8217;. The material Gormley selected was lead, which                   as a malleable metal would allow him to mold around his selected                   objects while retaining an approximation of their formal features                   in size and volume. Through this process of wrapping, the different                   objects were disconnected from their utilitarian identities                   and became part of a unified series, gaining new connections                   between them through their shear size and volume [ figure 19                   ]. The series was one of evolution of form created by the most                   simple objects of everyday use; &#8220;pea, pencil, carrot,                   plumb bob, goose egg, grenade, lemon, light bulb, pear, paintbrush,                   parsnip, pestle, marrow, bottle, coconut, ball of string, melon                   and ball. It was important to the artist that each real object                   should be inside its lead casings&#8221; [ ], as he mentioned                   that &#8220;&#8216;the surface carries the memory of a moment                   in the history of the object&#8221; [ ].</p>                <p> Some time after Gormley has submitted his art work for display,                   an interesting incidence occurred. &#8220;Soon after the sculpture                   was acquired, problems were noticed on the lead casings containing                   the banana, courgette, lemon, pea, parsnip and melon. The contents                   were decomposing and leaking, causing white disfiguring marks                   on the outside of the casings&#8221; [ ]. Those casings containing                   natural elements were distinguished by the others because they                   were contaminated from the inside as the objects decayed. The                   museum that was hosting the art work at that time had to go                   through a process of cleansing the selection for reasons of                   hygiene, especially since they have already started to exude                   displeasing odors. When they opened the casings, they found                   to their surprise a new undefined material that has emerged                   from the interaction of the lead with the natural elements;                   an actual dross material. </p>                <p>On this issue, the curators note: &#8220;There was sufficient                   solder between the four pieces of lead that made up the casing                   sections to saw through with a small piercing saw without touching                   the lead either side. To our surprise, a very thick white and                   brown crusty layer filled the void between the coconut shell                   and the inside of the shell casing. It looked like plaster but                   was identified as a lead corrosion product. Lead is susceptible                   to change when in contact with mild acidic by-products from                   the decomposing coconut formed a basic lead carbonate. The flattened                   fibers on the coconut husk had encrusted particles of lead carbonate                   and in places there was black mould&#8221; [ ].</p>                <p><strong>05 &gt;&gt; Composite Grafting</strong></p>                <p> The combination of actual obsolete with their molded by-products                   marks a novel territory for material reuse that I shall call                   here, composite grafting. The term &#8216;by-product&#8217;                   does not connote obsolete objects of the utilitarian waste stream;                   instead it adverts new &#8216;artificial&#8217; objects that                   can be formed by using an obsolete component as a reproductive                   matrix, or a mold. By using found objects as molds and casting                   on them different materials than the ones they were made of,                   the occurring by-products will retain partially characteristics                   of the original object, but will have different properties,                   creating assembly lines of materials with local behaviors and                   properties according to the material synthesis of the by-products.                   Composite materials make a useful analogy to the strategy of                   a composite graft; they are composed of elements that work together                   to produce material properties that are different to the properties                   of those elements on their own. On the basis of this assumption                   that relates to the behavior of material synthesis in a micro-level,                   it is advocated that larger obsolete ready-made components combined                   with their by-products will yield similar results. Grafting                   the actual obsolete component that has been rendered displaced                   and needs to be reused, with its own by-products, one can actually                   begin to develop new material properties and spatial products                   that exceed the realm of signification. Moreover, one can probe                   into the process of casting and imagine ways of reproduction                   that transgress the equal repetition of by-products. Casting                   is a process of many stages and these stages can be planned                   in such a way in order to yield variations or a pool of diverse                   components, instead of the exclusive return of the original                   object. By binding these objects in elusive yet promising combinations,                   one can imagine an emergent materiality with local behaviors                   and variable performances. Overwhelmed with the amounts of waste                   streams in all possible scales of reference, we either use objects                   as they are and put them together in a repetitive manner or                   liquefy them so as not to deal with their materiality at all.                   The fact that we need to reuse the actual obsolete matter that                   is nondisposable is apparent and indisputable. However, perhaps                   it is essential to bind this matter in more mystical assemblies                   in order to reuse it also to a cultural effect. This reused                   matter necessitates compulsively a new identity and a new relationship                   with its environment, other than the label &#8216;reused matter&#8217;                   and the concomitant positivist assumptions. Along these lines,                   lies the discourse of dross; dross is neither concerned with                   the salvation of the planet, nor with environmental policies.                   It is rather yearning for the fluctuation of meaning and identity                   of displaced matter. </p>                <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>                </td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td height="325" valign="bottom"> <div align="center">           <p><a href="../index.html" class="headerbig">P<em>ART</em></a><br>            <a href="../index.html" class="header">home</a></p>        </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td>      <td colspan="4"><font class="seventh" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>         2004 P<i>ART</i> and Lydia Kallipoliti.
