Sabine Rewald, for instance,                   writes that the bird-creatures &#8220;symbolize the imminent                   danger from Hitler&#8217;s Germany,&#8221; citing John Russell&#8217;s                   1967 biography of the artist.[1] Werner Spies and Diane Waldman                   have offered the same interpretation.[2] This fascist identity                   is bolstered by geographical aspects of the barbarian series&#8212;for                   example, the <em>Barbarians Marching to the West</em> of the                   same year, whose title defines the physical relationship between                   the Nazis and Max Ernst in Paris to the west. Indeed, all creatures                   in <em>The Barbarians</em> gaze, march, or point to the painting&#8217;s                   left, to the west, anticipating the literal blitzkrieg on the                   way.[3] Ernst himself confirmed all this in his comments about                   another painting in the same series: &#8220;<em>The Angel of                   Hearth and Home</em>&#8230; is of course an ironic title for                   a kind of juggernaut which crushes and destroys all that comes                   in its path. That was my impression at the time of what would                   probably happen in the world, and I was right.&#8221;[4]</p>                <table width="473" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis2.jpg" width="300" height="241"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="149" class="maintext">Fig. 2</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p>But the &#8216;barbarian&#8217; identity of these painted creatures                   is not only horrific, as a caricature or dream-image of fascism,                   but also as one of heroic self-identification: a vision of the                   surrealist group. Such a union of opposites by means of a painted                   object is in line with Ernst&#8217;s occult obsessions, and                   as a surrealist identity, it can be traced back to the celebrated                   s&eacute;ances of 1922 [Fig. 2], which Ernst attended with Breton                   and Paul Eluard (although he himself never entered the deep                   trance state demonstrated by Ren&eacute; Crevel, Benjamin P&eacute;ret,                   and Robert Desnos [Fig. 3]).[5] During one of these s&eacute;ances,                   Desnos related a lengthy and detailed fantasy about a &#8220;great                   oriental army&#8221; that would come from the east to free the                   western world from itself.[6] For Desnos and his proto-surrealist                   coconspirators of 1922, these barbarians were like madmen: a                   force outside the hated zone of church and bourgeois morality,                   outside the authority of the Freudian father who had sent his                   sons to die in the trenches&#8212;like the unconscious mind                   itself an enormous untapped wellspring of liberation. In April                   1925 Desnos&#8217; barbarian fantasy was published in <em>La                   R&eacute;volution surr&eacute;aliste</em>, under the title &#8220;Description                   d&#8217;une revolt prochaine.&#8221; Ernst was probably present                   at the birth-s&eacute;ance of these barbarians and, if not,                   would have almost certainly heard about them from Eluard, with                   whom he was living, or Breton, who was particularly impressed                   with Desnos&#8217; lavish gift for mediumistic communication                   at a time when Breton himself was about to define surrealism                   as pure psychic automatism: &#8220;Desnos <em>speaks Surrealist</em>                   at will.&#8221;[7] Ernst had participated in s&eacute;ances                   earlier, in Cologne, when he and his friend Franz Henseler learned                   about the death of Franz Marc through the medium Macchab.[8]                   The mediumistic realm, linked as it was both to the occult and                   to a Freudian notion of the unconscious, was a regular source                   of Ernst&#8217;s inspiration, and in the early surrealist sky                   the psychic star of Robert Desnos burned very brightly indeed.                   Back then barbarians were seen as icons not of fascism but of                   the coming <em>surrealist</em> revolution. </p>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="198"><img src="images/lewis3.jpg" width="198" height="300"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="178" class="maintext">Fig. 3</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis4.jpg" width="300" height="235"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="76" class="maintext">Fig. 4</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="456" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis5.jpg" width="300" height="207"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="132" class="maintext">Fig. 5</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis6.jpg" width="300" height="229"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="76" class="maintext">Fig. 6</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p class="second">Like much of Ernst&#8217;s pre-war painting,                   <em>The Barbarians</em> belongs to a series,[9] dated by most                   art historians back to <em>The Horde</em> of 1927 [Fig. 4] and                   said to include <em>The Barbarians Marching Westward</em> [Fig.                   5] and <em>The Angel of Hearth and Home</em> [Fig. 6], both                   from 1937, and this double, or repressed, identity is present                   in this series from its inception. In fact, <em>The Horde</em>&#8212;dated                   by Russell, Waldman, and Rewald as the first painting in the                   series&#8212;was executed well <em>before</em> the rise of Hitler                   and the prevalence of antifascism as a surrealist concern. 1927                   is a lot closer, in time as well as mood, to the heroes of &#8220;Description                   d&#8217;une revolt prochaine&#8221; than the monsters of German                   fascism. Furthermore, <em>The Horde</em> is a group of <em>men</em>,                   specifically, presented more or less parallel to the picture                   plane, which is unusual for Ernst, attuned as he was to sexual                   conflict and difference.[10] In fact, he only painted groups                   of men as &#8216;presentation&#8217; pictures, which portrayed                   his surrealist cohorts in various guises. These include the                   famous <em>Rendevous of Friends</em> [Fig. 7], which, despite                   its somewhat deeper space, also arranges most of its male protagonists                   parallel to the picture plane, and <em>Loplop Presents the Members                   of the Surrealist Group</em> [Fig. 8], in which the silhouette                   of Ernst&#8217;s avian alter ego presides over a framed mass                   of photos of various surrealist males. Ernst also plays variations                   on this presentation theme. Take, for example, <em>Rendevous                   of Friends&#8212;the Friends Become Flowers</em> [Fig. 9], with                   its mass of abstracted vegetable matter, again flat against                   the picture plane. In typical Ernstian fashion identity is suggested                   by the title; but here there is also a clue as to the kind of                   transformative game that the artist favors. If the surrealist                   group can be repainted as flowers, then why &#8216;present&#8217;                   them as a Desnos-inspired horde? </p>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis7.jpg" width="300" height="194"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="76" class="maintext">Fig. 7</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="197"><img src="images/lewis8.jpg" width="197" height="300"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="179" class="maintext">Fig. 8</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis9.jpg" width="300" height="245"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="76" class="maintext">Fig. 9</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p class="second">As Ernst&#8217;s series developed, this original                   surrealist identity with its heroic overtones became submerged,                   and it has remained submerged vis-&agrave;-vis art history,                   which has viewed the paintings only in light of their basic                   fascist identity, not in terms of this repressed surrealist                   one, which is repressed in the best and most obvious Freudian                   sense and therefore requires release, possibly in the surrealist                   friendly arena of wit or dreams.[11] Consider that the <em>The                   Angel of Hearth and Home</em> [Fig. 6] was retitled by Ernst                   in 1938 as <em>The Triumph of Surrealism</em>, &#8220;a despairing                   reference to the fact that the surrealists with their Communist                   ideas had been unable to do anything to resist fascism.&#8221;[12]                   Ernst&#8217;s ironic title functions according to Freud&#8217;s                   <em>Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious</em>, which                   reminds us that a &#8220;favorite definition of joking has long                   been the ability to find similarity between dissimilar things&#8212;that                   is, hidden similarities.&#8221;[13] Here the joke reconnects                   the fascist and surrealist identities in the barbarian series,                   and the winged beast reveals itself as both the ironic and <em>literal</em>                   triumph of surrealism&#8212;the triumph of the barbarians, one                   way or another. </p>                <p class="second">Ernst&#8217;s grattage technique&#8212;a form                   of rubbing and scraping of and against the still-wet paint used                   in <em>The Barbarians</em>&#8212;discloses this double identity                   not only as image but also as object, as the painted surface                   itself. Ernst&#8217;s development of grattage represents an                   attempt to align his painting practice with the purely surrealist                   one of automatic writing. The surrealist movement, defined initially                   as pure psychic automatism, was always conflicted about the                   possibility of properly surrealist painting. In the third issue                   of <em>La R&eacute;volution surr&eacute;aliste</em> (the same                   issue that featured &#8220;Description d&#8217;une Revolt Prochaine&#8221;)                   Pierre Naville had, for example, asserted that &#8220;there                   is no such thing as <em>surrealist painting</em>.&#8221;[14]                   Painting (with the early exception of Masson&#8217;s automatic                   drawings) was deemed too meditated to honestly and accurately                   access the unconscious. The grattage technique, because less                   controlled and more spontaneous, was closer to Breton&#8217;s                   definition of surrealism than the slower process of hand-painted                   dream photography. And in <em>The Barbarians</em> grattage is                   employed exclusively in and on the bodies of the painted creatures.                   They are made out of grattage, which, like frottage and the                   later decalcomania, is the closest Ernst ever got, in terms                   of technique, to pure psychic automatism and thus orthodox Bretonian                   surrealism. The figures&#8217; bodies define surrealism at the                   level of technique, which is here automatic. </p>                <p class="second">But hypnotic techniques, which the surrealists                   equated with potential liberation, have also been investigated                   in an attempt to comprehend fascism, to make sense of the subordination                   of a mass to the individual will, something which according                   to theory should have been antithetical to fully individualized                   bourgeois identities.[15] Automatism&#8212;and thus Ernst&#8217;s                   grattage&#8212;implies a passivity in relationship to a superior                   ego force and thus the archaic or fascistic dark side of the                   surrealist project of liberation. It can be implicated in fascism                   as convincingly as celebrated for surrealism. Could Ernst have                   been criticizing, perhaps unconsciously, the way the members                   of the surrealist group were behaving by the late thirties?                   This is, after all, the moment not only of the looming threat                   of Hitler and the Spanish Civil War, but of Ernst&#8217;s chafing                   under the authority of Breton&#8212;a surrealist authoritarianism                   that would lead to Ernst&#8217;s eventual break with the group.</p>                <p class="second">Can we begin to differentiate the picture&#8217;s                   individual barbarians, to define their relationships to each                   other? The bird-hybrid on the painting&#8217;s left, with her                   ballooning skirt shape and more delicate gesture and proportions,                   reads as female when compared to the hulking barbarian to her                   right. Rewald suggests a possible family unit: &#8220;The dark                   female leads the way as her male companion turns to look at                   the strange animal&#8212;perhaps their offspring&#8212;clinging                   to his left arm.&#8221;[16] This interpretation gains credence                   in light of Ernst&#8217;s many fantasy statements and the particular                   interactions of his iconographic systems, which tend to create                   complex constellations rather than stable groups of meaning.[17]                   Bird imagery is an overarching theme in Ernst&#8217;s work and                   has a particularly labyrinthine iconography [figs. 10 and 11].                   Ernst, according to his well-known autobiographical writings,                   cultivated a purposeful confusion between birds and humans,                   derived for him from the fact that his loved and trusted pet                   bird died on the day one of his sisters was born.[18] Birds                   are thus associated with death, which reinforces the fascist                   identity, but also typically with flight and thus freedom, a                   quintessentially surrealist value, and also with Ernst himself,                   who was said to look like a bird and was often described as                   such, both because of his facial features and as a laudatory                   metaphor for his personality.[19] Birds have sexual meaning                   in Freudian mythology and particularly in German as a slang                   reference to intercourse.[20] Ernst also invented Loplop as                   his bird alter ego, allowing us to read the bird-child as a                   coded oedipal self-portrait.[21]</p>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="223"><img src="images/lewis10.jpg" width="223" height="300"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="153" class="maintext">Fig. 10</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                    <td>&nbsp;</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="220"><img src="images/lewis11.jpg" width="220" height="300"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="156" class="maintext">Fig. 11</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p class="second">Bird-mother on the left, father to her right,                   and bird-child as Max Ernst constitute a classical oedipal triangle.                   The father&#8217;s right arm with its pointed, phallic fingers                   lunges at the mother&#8217;s genital area. This is a gesture                   of sexual union.[22] His arm also covers the mother&#8217;s                   genitals and therefore blocks her sexual availability, as per                   oedipal prescription. Consider that the bird-child is facing                   and possibly moving (thrusting its neck) to the <em>left</em>,                   towards the sexual enticements of the mother, as is the father                   with his aggressive striding and simultaneously penetrating                   and covering gesture. Father and son compete here for access                   to the primal mother. This sexual combat, moving always left,                   is reinforced by the enigmatic figure in the distance, also                   facing left, holding or pushing an ambiguous object that can                   be read as phallic, pointing towards the mother-creature. This                   sexual geography combines with the literal westward mapping                   of the fascist reading to suggest a conflation of national and                   sexual destiny&#8212;a conquering fascist male; passive, yielding                   Paris to the left/west.</p>                <p class="second">This oedipal field is, like the twinned fascist-surrealist                   identity, inscribed even at the level of technique. Grattage                   is one of Ernst&#8217;s many attempts to avoid orthodox, academic                   image-making like that of his father, a technically proficient                   but unimaginative amateur painter with a conventional style.                   In recalling his artistic beginnings Ernst admits to the overt,                   if not to say extravagant, oedipal nature of his artistic process:</p>                <blockquote>                  <p class="second"> I see before me a panel, very rudely painted                     with wide black lines on a red ground, representing false                     mahogany and calling forth associations of organic forms (menacing                     eye, long nose, great head of a bird with thick black hair,                     etc.)&#8230; In front of the panel, a glossy black man is                     making gestures, slow, comical, and, according to my memories                     of a very obscure epoch, joyously obscene. This rogue of a                     fellow wears the turned-up mustaches of my father.[23]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second">Then the symbolic violence begins: the father                   brandishes a fat crayon, sending horrible painted animals into                   a whirling vase, the crayon becomes a whip, the vase becomes                   a top which advances menacingly towards the Ernst-child&#8217;s                   bed. The primary psychosexual weapon in this essay of Ernst&#8217;s                   is painting itself, a too-obvious metaphor for sexual power,                   represented by the whip, literally born out of the father&#8217;s                   spent crayon. The title of this essay, &#8220;Beyond Painting,&#8221;                   represents not only technical possibility but the artist&#8217;s                   utterly Freudian aspiration to move beyond painting and thus                   beyond the castrating power of the father, who is always present,                   artistically, as tradition, as anything not invented or re-invented                   by Ernst as Oedipus.</p>                <p class="second">It is not surprising that Ernst equated painting                   with sorcery and hermetic lore. He wrote: &#8220;Max Ernst Died                   the 1st of August 1914. He resuscitated the 11th of November                   1918 as a young man aspiring to become a magician and to find                   the myth of his time&#8230;.&#8221; His peers liked to play                   along: Breton, for example, compared Ernst to legendary medieval                   alchemist Raymond Lull in his 1928 manifesto <em>Surrealism                   and Painting</em>, and nearly ten years later Dorothea Tanning                   painted her husband wearing a sorcerer&#8217;s vest, holding                   fire in one hand and conjuring a spirit bird.[24] Ernst favored                   alchemical imagery and mythology throughout his career; grattage                   is an alchemical technique in that it transforms base or overlooked                   material into artistic gold. <em>The Barbarians</em> belongs                   to Ernst&#8217;s occultism as much as it does to his Freudianism.[25]                   Its human-animal hybrids and subordination of specific time,                   scale, and place to the demands of myth evoke the 17th century                   alchemical engravings of Johann Daniel Mylius and Michael Maier,                   with which Ernst was probably familiar [Fig. 12].[26] In fact,                   the painting functions as a chemical wedding, an alchemical                   theme to which the artist returned throughout his career.[27]                   Such a union of male and female operates alchemically as part                   of a system of binaries&#8212;sun and moon, mercury and sulfur,                   life and death&#8212;whose unity or offspring is always the                   coveted Philosopher&#8217;s Stone, emblem of spiritual perfection.                   Chemical weddings, like two-headed hermaphrodites, are images                   of reconciliation in the hermetic imagination, often the last                   stage before perfection. We have already seen that the father&#8217;s                   arm marks a clear, though ungentle, union with the mother; their                   offspring, the spiritually perfected Philosopher&#8217;s Stone,                   is the bird-child, doubly identified as Ernst himself because                   of its position in the oedipal triangle and its possible identity                   as Loplop. Ernst, fond of trying on different identities in                   his work, also liked to wear the perfected mask, which reinforces                   the surrealist self-identification even as the implications                   of violence reiterates the fascist one.[28]</p>                <table width="400" border="0">                  <tr>                    <td width="300"><img src="images/lewis12.jpg" width="300" height="268"></td>                    <td width="10">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="76" class="maintext">Fig. 12</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p class="second">Alchemy also helps to identify the diminutive                   background figure, which can be read as an alchemist and its                   sprouting phallic shape as a bellows, used to stoke the alchemical                   fires. The figure&#8217;s stretched arms correspond to those                   of an alchemist engaged in such work. The bellows are a common                   enough alchemical image and can be found in Bruegel&#8217;s                   The Alchemist, for example [Fig. 13; detail and related engraving,                   Fig. 14]. The trio of creatures up front is produced by the                   labors of the background figure and therefore we find, by way                   of the alchemist on the horizon, a picture of this picture&#8217;s                   own making. The alchemist figure could well be another stand-in                   for the artist: alchemist equals creator, creator here means                   painter, and the painter is naturally Max Ernst. He thus portrays                   himself as the alchemist on a spiritual quest and as the coveted                   Philosopher&#8217;s Stone&#8212;the magician in search of a                   myth and the perfection of the myth itself. Note the sexual                   indeterminacy of this alchemist figure: phallic but dressed                   probably as a woman. Like his conjured barbarians, like the                   painting itself, this painter-alchemist Ernst has a doubled                   identity, such that the linearity of the hermetic fable is complicated                   by the play of self-portraits in various&#8212;often doubled&#8212;states                   of questing and perfection.</p>                <p class="second">Such multiplicity is indicative of what we have                   in <em>The Barbarians</em>: an <em>effect</em> rather than a                   prescription, the look&#8212;and not necessarily anything more                   than the look&#8212;of secret wisdom. Alchemy does not trump                   Freudianism here nor does it dissolve the overt vision of fascism.                   What the occult does do is combine fascist and surrealist identities                   in light of a philosophy that insists on such a union as spiritual                   and positions the painted object as the site of this paradoxical                   union. Such conjunction is not without historical resonance,                   as the occult was inspirational to both fascism and surrealism                   as they advanced towards obscurantism and revelation, and could                   suggest an artist&#8217;s attitude towards catastrophe, in which                   catastrophe is part of a larger spiritual whole, and believes                   therefore in the purity or theology of art. For Ernst and others                   like him, on the eve of disaster, art-for-art&#8217;s sake might                   have been the only remaining hope.</p>                <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>                <p class="second"><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>                <p class="second"> 1.

Bird imagery and the relationship between                   whole, naturalistic birds and imaginary bird-human hybrids form                   overarching themes in Ernst&#8217;s work.
