His choice of                   location was not arbitrary; it was exactly fifty years earlier                   that Joseph Beuys&#8217; plane is said to have crashed on that                   same peninsula,[2] his rescue by Tatars a turning point in his                   life and the moment of his rebirth. Although Afrika&#8217;s                   stay at the hospital was voluntary, only five staff members                   knew that this was an artistic performance. His experiences                   there were preparation for his one-man show <em>Crimania</em>:                   Icons, Monuments, Maz&agrave;faka, which took place in 1995,                   two years after the hospital performance, at the Austrian Museum                   of Applied Arts (MAK) in Vienna. This exhibition, which was                   about the &#8220;obsession of creating an exhibition&#8221;,[3]                   according to Afrika, consisted of installations and displays                   of his collection of Soviet memorabilia, such as busts of Lenin,                   flags, banners and medals &#8211; items that normally filled                   the walls and shelves of Afrika&#8217;s St. Petersburg studio.                 </p>                <p>This paper will examine <em>Crimania</em> as Afrika&#8217;s                   attempt to come to terms with the period of political and social                   uncertainty after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which                   he labeled the time of &#8220;Great Aphasia.&#8221; This performance                   and the MAK exhibition are significant both because of the historical                   moment in which they occurred, and also because <em>Crimania</em>                   brings together a number of elements that recur throughout Afrika&#8217;s                   work: his interest in sign systems, language, psychoanalysis                   and the layering of history. I will explore how the performance                   and the subsequent exhibition function, as the artist negotiates                   the transitions taking place around him. I will also consider                   whether Afrika&#8217;s personal experiences during <em>Crimania</em>                   can be translated into a universal message for his audience,                   similar to Joseph Beuys&#8217; aim to translate his own personal                   awakening into a universal experience for mankind.</p>                <p><strong>The Location</strong></p>                <p> In February of 1993, Afrika made the long train journey from                   the Baltic to the Black Sea; from St. Petersburg, his artistic                   home, to Crimea, near the region of his birth[4]; from present-day                   Russia to newly independent Ukraine. At the time, Russia and                   Ukraine were still arguing over which country would maintain                   control of the Crimean peninsula, a once-independent republic                   of the USSR that had been &#8216;returned&#8217; to Ukraine                   by Khrushchev in 1954. As Afrika noted, &#8220;the people living                   there&#8230;were then unable to fully understand where they                   are situated, which currency system exists around them and what                   citizenship they have because, although the area was acknowledged                   to be part of the Ukraine, Soviet passports were still valid                   and were actually the only ones that existed.&#8221;[5] Thus                   the artist, who also complained of &#8220;a feeling of uncertainty,                   confusion about &#8216;which country I live in,&#8217;&#8221;[6]                   journeyed further into the mire, in order to find his way out.</p>                <p> Afrika&#8217;s ultimate destination was the Crimean Republican                   Psychiatric Hospital No. 1, in Simferopol. The psychiatric hospital,                   as the artist maintained, although different from the outside                   world, &#8220;actually is its copy and immediate continuation&#8230;The                   hospital is a mimetic system of the social structure within                   which it exists.&#8221;[7] As Michael Ryklin has observed, a                   hierarchy existed in the hospital in Simferopol. The weaker                   patients, those who were chronically ill, such as the schizophrenics,                   were oppressed by the more conscious patients suffering from                   neurotic disorders. Through oppression, the stronger patients                   tried to &#8220;secure for themselves the status of the healthy                   within a society composed of the ill.&#8221;[8] The social hierarchy                   both emerged from and was sustained by existing circumstances,                   and functioned only within the walls of the hospital.</p>                <p>Afrika is aware not only of the socio-historical significance                   of the Crimean peninsula to recent Russian history (it was the                   location of the Yalta Conference in 1945, and also where Gorbachev                   was held under house arrest in 1991, for example) but also the                   art historical tradition linked to the region. It was in Crimea                   that Afrika&#8217;s avant-garde precursor, Joseph Beuys, claimed                   to have experienced his artistic birth. Although we still seek                   the facts behind the mythology of Beuys&#8217; plane crash,                   curator Peter Noever, when he visited Simferopol, observed that                   inhabitants of Crimea still spoke of Beuys with reverence, even                   those not necessarily interested in art. They &#8220;&#8216;breathed                   his spirit,&#8217; regarded him as &#8216;their son,&#8217;                   guarded his secret (&#8216;only pathologically interested art                   historians would attempt to find the &#8216;truth&#8217;, claims                   Noever).&#8221;[9] In choosing this location for his performance,                   Afrika both participates in and sustains the Beuys myth. Viktor                   Mazin has also noted the parallels between Afrika&#8217;s three-week                   stay in a mental hospital and Beuys&#8217; 1974 performance                   at the Rene Block Gallery, I Like America and America Likes                   Me, when Beuys spent two weeks coexisting with a wild coyote.                   According to Mazin, &#8220;both rituals involve placing oneself                   alongside the &#8216;inhuman&#8217; and the &#8216;wild&#8217;                   (animal/insane). The wildness of Beuys is homologous with the                   nature of Afrika who instantly establishes &#8220;hypnotic&#8221;                   contact with members of the animal kingdom.&#8221;[10]</p>                <p><strong>The Goals</strong></p>                <p> The project used a scientific method to seek answers about                   art and artistic expression. It was officially conducted by                   the S. A. Bugaev Group, which consisted of Afrika, the patient;                   Vitkor Mazin, Afrika&#8217;s friend who acted as his relative                   during the project; and Professor Samokhvalov, the head doctor                   at the hospital. Mazin outlined the goals of the Group, the                   primary task being to examine Afrika&#8217;s psychological state                   in the aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union. In order                   to do this, the Group saw it necessary to determine the connection                   between the artist&#8217;s emotional state and &#8220;the representation                   of things which act as objects of power, i.e., which actually                   represent representation.&#8221;[11] This was because in addition                   to being an artist, Afrika is also a collector. He collects                   many things: artifacts of Russian folklore, such as old wooden                   painted trunks (as seen in his 2002 installation at the Whitney                   Museum); relics of the Soviet Empire, such as busts of Lenin,                   banners, and medals; and vestiges of the first avant-garde,                   in the form of rare editions of Kazimir Malevich. </p>                <p>A collection, as an entity, seeks to preserve a phenomenon                   or object as a piece of history, yet in doing so abstracts the                   object from its original context, placing borders around it                   as something separate, yet unified. In this sense, the collection                   identifies a particular thing as belonging to a group, as having                   a common identity &#8211; a quality that Afrika seems to have                   regretted losing when he lost his collective identity as a Soviet                   citizen. Consequently, the Group sought to discover the motivation                   behind Afrika&#8217;s collecting and exhibiting these icons                   of the former Soviet Empire[12] and to answer the question:                   &#8220;Does the representation of Former Institutions of power                   in their metonymical manifestations constitute a representation                   of representation directed towards the healing of a socio-psychological                   trauma?&#8221;[13] In other words, is Afrika&#8217;s collecting                   a pathology, or a process of healing?</p>                <p> Additionally, Afrika and Professor Samokhvalov were interested                   in an explanation of both the creation and evolution of new                   sign systems. Afrika has labeled the period after the breakup                   of the Soviet Union the time of &#8220;Great Aphasia,&#8221;[14]                   or a &#8220;pseudo-aphasia.&#8221;[15] Technically, aphasia                   is a mental condition that involves the loss of one&#8217;s                   ability to use words, which means an inability to connect signifier                   (the word) and signified (the concept). Afrika has described                   aphasia as &#8220;the powerful vacation of language structures.&#8221;[16]                   While clinical aphasia is usually the result of an injury to                   the brain, aphasia can also appear metaphorically, when a structure                   that keeps a sign system intact is disrupted.</p>                <p> The catalyst for the time of Great Aphasia, then, was the                   dissolution of the Soviet Union. By December of 1991, after                   individual nations had declared their independence one by one,                   Gorbachev was forced to resign as President of the USSR, having                   become a leader without a country. Other symbols that had also                   ceased to have meaning were removed, such as the statue of Dzerzhinsky,                   founder of the Cheka (precursor to the KGB), which was knocked                   down from its pedestal in front of the KGB headquarters in Moscow.                   The hammer and sickle flag of the Soviet Union was lowered from                   the Kremlin; it had become a national flag without a nation.                   In time, street names changed, and acronyms were replaced; for                   example, the KGB (Committee of State Security) became the FSB                   (Federal Security Service). Once the totalitarian structure                   had been dismantled, the sign systems that it held in place                   ceased to function.</p>                <p> These circumstances force the artist, as a user and manipulator                   of signs and sign systems, into &#8220;the difficult situation                   of a system of images in which the sign, on the one hand, ceases                   to be a sign and, on the other, witnesses the emergence of a                   new sign.&#8221;[17] Afrika&#8217;s avant-garde predecessors                   from the revolutionary period found themselves working in similar                   conditions. According to Afrika, it was Vladimir Mayakovskii                   who was, &#8220;in some sense, the creator of the sign system                   on whose grandiose ruins we are currently standing.&#8221;[18]                   During the second and third decades of the 20th century, many                   avant-garde artists like Mayakovskii, including Kazimir Malevich,                   El Lissitzky, and especially the Constructivists, were striving                   to create a new sign system, one that would be completely transparent                   and whose form would clearly and efficiently convey the ideals                   of the burgeoning communist state. If, for instance, Mayakovskii                   managed to create the language of Soviet socialism, who, then,                   would produce its equivalent for the new Russian Federation?                   Or might such a task, as <em>Crimania</em> suggests, prove futile                   with the abolition of a monolith in favor of a pluralistic society?                 </p>                <p>If Afrika does not, as did his avant garde predecessors, seek                   to create a new language for Post-Soviet Russia, what he does                   do, in a variety of different ways throughout his &#339;uvre,                   is foreground sign systems as systems in order to call attention                   both to their beauty, as well as their weaknesses and lack of                   universality. Two elements of the <em>Crimania</em> exhibition                   at MAK make this clear: the flags (or banners) and the rebuses.                   The artist has taken old Soviet-era banners inspiring the &#8220;proletariat                   of the world to unite,&#8221; and superimposed on them symbols                   from different cultures and religions, from different periods                   and different parts of the world. With these flags we see a                   layering of cultural codes from different social orders. This                   decontextualization disables the Soviet symbols, reducing them                   to simply another layer of the palimpsest of human culture.                   These symbols from different eras lose their original meaning                   but do not acquire a logical new one within the flag, resulting                   in the glossolalia, or nonsense language, of aphasia.</p>                <p> The rebuses also present incomprehensible systems that can                   be examined, but not necessarily deciphered. The walls of Afrika&#8217;s                   Museum Aphasia are covered with symbols appropriated from Soviet                   rebuses of the 1950s combined with other signs, letters and                   symbols added by the artist. The additions complicate the rebus,                   leaving its original message corrupted. Furthermore, these rebuses                   were meant to be viewed by different audiences, both Russian                   and non-Russian. Because the Cyrillic alphabet is made up of                   letters that look and sound the same as those in the Roman alphabet                   (Cyrillic M = Roman M), letters that look the same but are pronounced                   differently (Cyrillic H = Roman N), and letters which look nothing                   like Roman letters (_, _), only some of the letters can be read                   by a non-Russian speaking audience. Others are misread, and                   still others only appear as symbols.[19] Thus a reading of the                   already illegible rebuses is further frustrated for those who                   do not read Cyrillic. Ironically, these rebuses are literally                   transparent &#8211; they can be seen from both inside and outside                   the Museum Aphasia building. Unfortunately, however, the translucent                   paper on which they are printed offers little in the way of                   illumination. Much like the utopia promised by the leaders of                   the Revolution, these images offer promises, but never results.                 </p>                <p><strong>The Conclusions</strong></p>                <p> The exhibition catalogue for <em>Crimania</em> provides thoroughly                   detailed notes of the experiment from all three participants:                   Afrika, Professor Samokhvalov and Viktor Mazin. While the notes                   propose and speculate, only Professor Samokhvalov, the scientist                   of the Group, offers conclusions. Viktor Mazin, for example,                   poses only questions, such as: &#8220;Can we consider that answers                   have been found to any of these questions? Do the questions                   need to be answered? Is the answer not contained in the question,                   making the question superfluous? Is the question satisfactory                   once it has been translated into the illusion of an answer?                   Is there a teleological desire to receive an answer at all?&#8221;[20]</p>                <p>One way to understand the function of questioning in the project                   is to refer to Viktor Tupitsyn&#8217;s categorization of Afrika&#8217;s                   work as &#8220;goblinry.&#8221; The wood-goblin, a well-known                   Russian folk character, lives in the forest and knows every                   inch of it by heart; but instead of helping those lost in the                   woods, he purposely misguides them. According to Tupitsyn, he                   &#8220;knows what not to know.&#8221;[21] The purpose of the                   wood-goblin, in literature, is &#8220;to lead the way and lead                   astray but never arrive anywhere.&#8221;[22] In some ways, Afrika                   does resemble the wood-goblin, in that he leads us down a circuitous                   path that constantly causes us to wonder where, in fact, we                   are headed. Unlike the wood-goblin, however, Afrika seems to                   join us in our uncertainty, his artistic meanderings meant to                   inspire, rather than to harm. Because the wood-goblin already                   knows, and knows well enough to &#8220;know what not to know,&#8221;                   he has no use for searching. While the wood-goblin poses no                   questions, Afrika puts them forth ceaselessly. His work sets                   questioning into motion, while knowing or finding the answers                   becomes of secondary importance. </p>                <p>The tangible results of Afrika&#8217;s stay in Simferopol were                   two-fold. At the end of the three-week-long performance, the                   artist held an exhibition in the least likely of spaces: in                   the room for the chronically ill patients in the psychiatric                   hospital. This exhibition coincided with both Afrika&#8217;s                   release from the hospital and Soviet Army and Navy Day, which,                   although no longer an official holiday, was still acknowledged                   by many. Two years later, Afrika staged a second exhibition                   in a more conventional venue, the MAK Gallery in Vienna.[23]                   Less definitive, however, was the reconciliation Afrika came                   to about his own personal psyche, both with regard to the loss                   of his Soviet identity, and also with regard to his avant-garde                   precursors and also Joseph Beuys, the precursor to Afrika&#8217;s                   Crimean experience.</p>                <p>What <em>Crimania</em> does make clear is how Afrika truly                   differs from his artistic forefathers whom he so revered, including                   Malevich, Mayakovskii and Rodchenko, who proposed, theorized                   and created prototypes of a new language appropriate to the                   new socialist lifestyle. Afrika does not offer a new language,                   but rather exposes existing language systems for what they are                   &#8211; systems that, although functioning, are inherently flawed.                   Like the muddled rebuses, whose logic is contained within their                   borders, and the social order that exists only within the mental                   hospital, the Soviet language of socialism only functioned within                   the socialist system. Once the infrastructure that supported                   the system was destroyed, the language also collapsed. In the                   same way, once the symbols of the system, such as the busts                   of Lenin, were removed and placed in a collection, their original                   meanings were displaced. Afrika has labeled the period just                   after their removal the &#8220;Time of Great Aphasia&#8221;                   both because of the fact that old symbols were awaiting new                   meanings, and because everyone was awaiting the development                   of new symbols. But as we will learn from Professor Samokhvalov,                   the new language system would have to develop of its own accord                   from within the new order, rather than being created from without.                 </p>                <p>From his observations of Afrika during <em>Crimania</em>, Professor                   Samokhvalov concluded that, &#8220;art develops because the                   behavior (language) of its creators develops.&#8221;[24] One                   of the ways this occurs is through the emergence of new symbols,                   which can only take place through endospection,[25] or observation                   of phenomena from within, which accurately describes what took                   place during the <em>Crimania</em> performance. If Afrika&#8217;s                   stay in a mental hospital is to contribute to the construction                   of a new language, it will occur as a result of the reciprocity                   between artist and sign system. It is only with the perspective                   of time that we will be able to witness this change, as it was                   concluded from the experiment that the conscious creation of                   a new sign system, and of new signs, is simply not possible.</p>                <p> Although Samokhvalov&#8217;s analysis of Afrika&#8217;s personality                   revealed a desire on the part of the artist to &#8220;grow from                   an adolescent into a Hero,&#8221;[26] I do not believe that                   <em>Crimania</em> was an attempt to heal the wounds of his former                   Soviet compatriots, but simply to understand his own affliction.                   This brings us back to both Beuys and Guattari, who were mentioned                   at the beginning of the paper. Whereas the artist-shaman Joseph                   Beuys was looking to heal the soul of mankind, it seems clear                   that with <em>Crimania</em>, Afrika had merely hoped to understand                   the temporary schizophrenia caused by a sudden trauma, the collapse                   of a nation, the loss of a national identity and a common language.                   Like Guattari, the artist recognizes the chaos and schizophrenia                   of contemporary society, and, instead of fighting it, attempts                   to negotiate it as best he can.[27] Afrika seems to understand                   that by manipulating the signs and symbols of society, past                   and present, the artist can play a role in the generation of                   new sign systems. But these systems cannot be forced on society                   from without, as we have learned from the failed projects of                   Malevich, Lissitzky and the Constructivists. The artist can                   contribute to the development of the new systems as they evolve                   only according to the needs and experiences of the culture in                   question. In this sense <em>Crimania</em> presents us not with                   the dystopia that we may expect; the conclusions of the participant,                   or lack thereof, keep us open to the possibility of the creation                   of a new language, without yet presenting one in its completion.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>                <p>[1] Mikhail Ryklin, &#8220;The Artist in the Collection and                   the World,&#8221; in Peter Noever, ed., Sergei Bugaev Afrika:                   Crimania: Icons, Monuments, Maz&agrave;faka (Germany: Cantz                   Verlag, 1995), 16.<br>                  [2] The plane crash is said to have occurred outside Sevastopol,                   which lays southwest of Simferopol, on the Crimean coast.
