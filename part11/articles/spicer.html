But the                     underlying convulsions that make these stylistic revolutions                     inevitable remain the same. We are still suffering from a                     disease of which Goya was the first to describe the symptoms.                     &#8211;Fred Licht</p>                </blockquote>                <p>Jake and Dinos Chapman have been continually preoccupied with                   Francisco Goya throughout their career. Their sculpted version                   of Goya&#8217;s <em>Great Courage! Against Corpses!</em> was                   the centerpiece of the Sensation exhibition which opened at                   the Royal Academy in London in 1997 and traveled, only to open                   controversially, to the Brooklyn Museum in 1999. Later that                   same year, British publisher Charles Booth-Clibborn commissioned                   this artist-brother duo to execute a suite of prints on a topic                   of their choice. The Chapmans&#8217; first-ever engagement with                   the medium of printmaking resulted in 82 black-and white, untitled                   prints that appropriate Goya&#8217;s Disasters of War print                   series of ca. 1810-20. Using hardground, softground, drypoint,                   and aquatint etching, they lift Goya&#8217;s series out of the                   context of the early nineteenth century and re-contextualize                   it under the late twentieth-century topos of modern warfare,                   adding a distinctive, contemporary flavor to Goya&#8217;s masterpiece.                   Diverse subjects such as fascism, the Holocaust, nuclear and                   biological warfare, Star Wars, and pornographic surrealism make                   the Chapmans&#8217; prints a combination of the fantastic, the                   visionary, the brutal, and the comic. </p>                <p>However, it is what Fred Licht refers to in his quote as the                   condition from which we still suffer&#8212;the madness, irrationality,                   and horror of war&#8212;that bridges a seemingly vast 200-year                   gap between Goya and these contemporary British artists. If                   Goya was indeed one of the first to describe these symptoms,                   the Chapmans&#8217; prints continue in the spirit of Goya&#8217;s                   diagnosis, while simultaneously commenting on 200 years of escalating                   insanity and brutality that has transpired since Goya&#8217;s                   own time. As Guardian critic Jonathan Jones has shrewdly noted,                   the Chapmans&#8217; work is &#8220;not so much a travesty of                   Goya as [it is] an extension of his despair.&#8221;1 This bridge                   of despair enables us to utilize rather effectively the trope                   of abject horror, which, in turn, while significantly underlining                   each of the artists&#8217; powerful indictment of man&#8217;s                   inhumanity to man, enables us to appreciate how contemporary                   the Chapmans&#8217; project is. </p>                <p>In her 1982 text, Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection,                   Julia Kristeva outlined key principles of abjection, the basis                   of which is that which repels, rejects, or repulses. The abject                   can pose a threat to one&#8217;s own personal stability or well-being.                   Kristeva notes, &#8220;Refuse and corpses show me what I permanently                   thrust aside in order to live,&#8221; and it is the corpse,                   in fact, that is the paragon of abjection in her analysis.2                   Severed limbs, disembodied heads, and disfigured faces can all                   elicit horror in the viewer, challenging bodily gestalts by                   showing that which is perilous to human existence. </p>                <p>For example, Goya&#8217;s Great Courage! Against Corpses! (Plate                   39), which inspired the Chapmans&#8217; sculpted version in                   Sensation as well as their etched version [C1], is a stark tableau                   of severed limbs and a truncated torso. Presented in an extremely                   direct, almost still-life manner, the corpse in both the Chapmans                   and Goya&#8217;s versions is the result of that which threatens                   our bodily integrity&#8212;dismemberment. These corpses are                   phobic objects, as Licht observes in the work of Goya: &#8220;The                   body of man, for untold centuries represented as an object of                   reverence, is for the first time rendered as corrupt and repulsive,                   bereft of nobility, and bearing no trace of the spirit that                   once inhabited it.&#8221;3 This hacked-up figure is no longer                   a religious body, no longer redeemed by God, and the Chapmans                   would agree: &#8220;Goya introduces finality&#8212;the absolute                   terror of material termination.&#8221;4 Goya&#8217;s victims                   of beatings, hackings, and hangings look like the forsaken dead.                 </p>                <p>Yet, there is the possibility of a cathartic release in these                   images. As Kristeva noted, the abject stirs a sense of survival                   in the viewer&#8212;it provokes one&#8217;s will to live, to                   maintain the integrity of one&#8217;s corporeal existence. Both                   works evoke not only pathos, but also a desire not to die in                   an undignified manner such as this. As a result, the body parts                   metonymically signify a threat to our bodily existence, embodying,                   on the one hand, a result of man&#8217;s capacity for brutality,                   while on the other provoking a will to survive that proclivity.                 </p>                <p>In keeping with their overall endeavor to not copy Goya but                   to transform his unique vision into their own versions of the                   horrors of war, the Chapmans add to their image an indictment                   of the worst purveyors of modern violence. The swastika etched                   on the surface of the plate holds the Nazis accountable for                   the atrocities seen in this image. While Goya responded to the                   violence of Napoleonic forces in Spain, the Chapmans locate                   the Nazis in a historical lineage of crimes against humanity                   that extends from Goya&#8217;s own time to the modern era. </p>                <p>In a similarly accusatory gesture, the Chapmans conflate the                   symbolic and the abject in print 43 [C43] by conjoining four                   severed fingers into the shape of a swastika. As a result, the                   fingers and splattered blood come together to signify acts of                   violation and defilement of the human body during the Holocaust.                   It is as if the Chapmans have removed these fingers from the                   severed arm in Goya&#8217;s Great Courage! in order to comment                   on the historical truth behind the Nazi party emblem. </p>                <p>Haunting images of abject horror are brought to the forefront                   in other Chapman prints inspired by Goya. The ninth print [C9]                   features the same hanging figure in Goya&#8217;s Nor This (Plate                   36), but the Spaniard&#8217;s reclining, voyeuristic soldier                   is omitted in order to intensify the visual impact of this execution                   scene. Furthermore, this violent act is made all the more menacing                   by the anonymity of the figure. Occluding the solider de-contextualizes                   this lynched figure, situating him in the realm of some unknown                   form of racial, social, or military violence. He becomes even                   more anonymous, a universal Everyman who signifies, as a victim,                   a potential threat to our existence at the hands of racial or                   social injustice. </p>                <p>The Chapman brothers transform the soldiers in Goya&#8217;s                   What More Can Be Done? (Plate 33) into three garish, cartoon-like                   figures in the second print [C2]. They are about to commit an                   overtly gruesome violation of this body, an act that is analogous                   to the narrative structure of Goya&#8217;s version. However,                   the Chapmans render their torturing and tortured figures in                   a more free, gestural manner that amplifies the irrationality                   and insanity of this act. Extreme deviation from standards of                   normal experiences becomes all the more apparent here. Kristeva&#8217;s                   text and Simon Taylor&#8217;s essay &#8220;The Phobic Object:                   Abjection in Contemporary Art,&#8221; offer pertinent reflections                   that are certainly discernable in this and other Chapman prints.                   There is a disruption or disturbance of identity, system, and                   order (all-out violation of the figure); an undermining of idealizing                   notions of the sublime and the beautiful (the eerie characters);                   and an adversary of all that is acceptable and proper (this                   gruesome act).5</p>                <p> The eighth in the series [C8], inspired by Goya&#8217;s This                   is Still Worse (Plate 37), is a similar cartoon-like vignette.                   The central, armless figure from Goya&#8217;s print is still                   present, but the Chapmans have added child-like, quickly rendered                   characters to their composition. Goya&#8217;s print evokes a                   disturbing uneasiness that is intensified in the Chapmans&#8217;                   by the addition of these bizarre bystanders who gawk at this                   scene as if it were some sort of macabre merry-go-round. The                   lithographic, crayon-like lines also create a sense of juvenilia-meets-horror,                   and in light of Goya&#8217;s title, as well as this figure&#8217;s                   gaze, we are provoked to wonder what could be worse than this                   act of corporeal desecration. </p>                <p>Before examining their more free-form, imaginative Disasters                   prints, we should consider a final example of the Chapmans&#8217;                   direct engagement with Goya&#8217;s Disasters of War, Number                   41 [C41]. This work is strikingly similar to Goya&#8217;s The                   Consequences (Plate 72). Both works evoke the nightmarish fear                   of attacks by nocturnal creatures, but the Chapmans&#8217; version                   is reversed. While this could be a technical oversight or a                   means of distinguishing their own print from its source, what                   is more intriguing is how, in the next print, [C42] they play                   with Goya&#8217;s image by turning the scene around to reveal                   the opposite side. This reversal exposes a theatrical, prop-like                   setting, possibly a jibe at critics, such as Guardian writer                   Adrian Searle, who have pointed out that Goya was an alleged                   witness to the horrors of the Peninsular War, thanks to his                   well-known print, I Saw This (Plate 44), whereas the Chapmans                   have only seen horror through the eyes of television, cinema,                   and the media.6 The staged setting functions as a Chapman tongue-in-cheek                   counter-critique designed to downplay the importance of first-hand                   or eyewitness experience. In other words, just because Goya                   &#8220;saw this&#8221; and the Chapmans &#8220;did not&#8221;                   does not make their work any less serious or relevant.</p>                <p> A lack of seriousness is, in fact, one of the most common                   criticisms of these two young artists. Their frequent use of                   humorous (and, according to some critics, sometimes appalling)                   visual puns has earned them a reputation as the enfant terribles                   of the British art world. However, the positive, recuperative                   value of abjection&#8212;its ability to instill survival in                   the viewer&#8212;is complemented by the function of humour or                   laughter in this visual field of repulsion and revulsion. Goya&#8217;s                   ironic titles and the Chapmans&#8217; humorous devices are ways                   of placing or displacing abjection. When confronted with a challenge                   to our sense of stability or survival, the ability to laugh                   at that threat becomes a means of diluting or diminishing the                   impact of abject horror. A common feature of horror films, laughter                   is a form of scatological purging or cleansing that David Falconer,                   author of the London ICA&#8217;s 1996 Chapmanworld exhibition                   catalogue, has detected in the Chapmans&#8217; work.7 Humour                   tempers the intolerability of abject imagery found in their                   Disasters of War, which Jennifer Ramkalawon has also observed:                   the Chapmans &#8220;use humour as a weapon of deflation and                   to indulge their appetite for game playing.&#8221;8 The horrific                   impact of their imagery is thus diluted and made easier to swallow.                   Although the brothers have been scolded for their mischievous                   visual antics, most critics have failed to recognize in their                   work the positive value of comic repulsion and irony as a displacement                   of the abject.</p>                <p> Goya&#8217;s iconography is often disturbing, but the titles                   of his images also introduce ironic humour into the scenes.                   For example, his declaration, &#8220;Great Courage! Against                   Corpses,&#8221; is contrary to what we know to be true&#8212;there                   is no courage or nobility in the atrocity committed against                   this figure. &#8220;What More Can Be Done?&#8221; is a rhetorical                   reflection upon this torturous act&#8212;we are asked to imagine                   what could be worse than this. Goya&#8217;s ironic statements                   displace the corrosive evocation of the image while simultaneously                   seeking to re-inscribe dignity to these corpses. </p>                <p>Print 61 [C61] is a similarly harrowing scene of carnage, with                   severed heads and crucified figures seen through the eyes of                   a skull. Yet, notice how the Chapmans introduce humour into                   their untitled prints by means of their own idiosyncratic and                   ironic statements. The crucified figure on the left proclaims,                   &#8220;Oi, Peter I can see your house from here,&#8221; to which                   there is no response from the figure on the right. Although                   some viewers may not find humour in this comment, it is nevertheless                   their attempt to add an element of comedy to this otherwise                   bleak tableau. Number 62 [C62] truly captures this unique, and                   sometimes challenging, blend of repulsion and humour. Inscribed                   above this perverse amalgamation of children (inspired by their                   fiberglass &#8220;Zygotic acceleration&#8221; model, also in                   Sensation) is a statement by the figure on the far left directing                   us to &#8220;look! 36 penises, 16 vaginas, 6 anuses: It must                   be a girl!&#8221; These figures could be the result of a genetic                   experiment gone awry or genetic defects caused by nuclear or                   biological warfare, the effects from the fallout of the three-tiered                   mushroom cloud in number 44 [C44]. The irony is that, despite                   advances in the fields of medicine or defense, tragic mistakes                   are the result of misused or abused technology. </p>                <p>The Chapman brothers have the ability to direct their wit and                   humour at themselves, too. Number 26 [C26] features one of their                   trademark &#8220;fuck-face&#8221; figures wearing a t-shirt                   version of their print based on Goya&#8217;s What Courage! In                   addition to a comic device, the shirt functions on a simulacral                   level, as well. In French author Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s writings                   on simulation theory, he notes that souvenirs are ersatz substitutions                   for the real thing&#8212;&#8220;if you can&#8217;t have the                   original, just buy a copy.&#8221; Thus, the shirt could be interpreted                   as a Chapman mockery of art market commodification (i.e., the                   proliferation of art-based commodities sold at museums and galleries),                   or perhaps it is a coy means of promoting their art and merchandise.                   This visual pun nevertheless makes more palatable the gravity                   of Goya&#8217;s, as well as their own, abject imagery.</p>                <p> Recently, the Chapmans have been scorned for committing the                   ultimate act of artistic mockery. Two years after completing                   the Booth-Clibborn series of DOW prints, the &#8220;Brothers                   Grimm&#8221; purchased their very own suite of Goya DOW prints                   and altered them by adding gas masks, as well as clown and puppy                   dogs&#8217; heads, to Goya&#8217;s figures. The resulting work                   was dubbed &#8220;Insult to Injury&#8221; and unveiled for the                   first time in early 2003 at Modern Art Oxford, England. If the                   Booth-Clibborn edition garnered a minimal amount of press, the                   resounding indictment from critics was a scathing accusation                   of vandalizing an original work of art. However, the fallout                   from their seeming attack on Goya&#8217;s prints is actually                   indicative of a much deeper issue: preserving the sanctity of                   the artist-genius.</p>                <p> To counter these claims of violating the integrity of Goya&#8217;s                   original works, Jake Chapman cited the example of Robert Rauschenberg&#8217;s                   Erased de Kooning of 1953.9 Rauschenberg spent two months erasing                   a de Kooning drawing given to him by the elder artist. Rauschenberg&#8217;s                   gesture could be seen as an act of love-cum-defiance, as the                   younger artist both admired and sought to challenge the Abstract                   Expressionist elder. The Chapmans preoccupation with Goya is                   undeniable, as evidenced by the Booth-Clibborn prints and their                   sculptural Goya-based works. Their &#8220;rectification&#8221;                   (the artists&#8217; term) of the Goya prints could be seen as                   a similar Rauschenbergian act of defiant love, a counter-romantic                   challenge to the inviolability of Goya&#8217;s artistic genius.                 </p>                <p>&#8220;Insult to Injury&#8221; resulted in several published                   reviews, one of which was titled &#8220;Goya Probably Would                   Not Be Amused&#8221; by Alan Riding in the New York Times, March                   2003. Yet, perhaps the reverse is true. It is significant to                   take note of the fact that Rauschenberg was able to request                   a drawing from de Kooning, whereas the Chapmans obviously were                   not afforded the same opportunity. Nevertheless, they altered                   the Goya prints, and considering the irrational subtext that                   inspires these artists&#8217; work, I offer a rather ahistorical                   response to this critic&#8217;s ahistorical yet not altogether                   insignificant musing on a dead artist&#8217;s thoughts: Goya                   not only could have been amused, but he might have even appreciated                   the Chapmans&#8217; incendiary gesture. Their &#8220;vandalizing&#8221;                   of Goya in the &#8220;Insult to Injury&#8221; series, in fact,                   keeps with the theme of &#8220;body vandalizing&#8221; in Goya&#8217;s                   own prints. </p>                <p>Subjected to harsh criticism, objected to by critics, and composed                   of abject iconography, Jake and Dinos Chapmans&#8217; Disasters                   of War series indeed extends Goya&#8217;s spirit of despair                   into the twenty-first century. Their response to the insanity,                   irrationality, and horror of warfare re-inscribes within the                   trope of abject horror Goya&#8217;s own commentary on this historically                   ubiquitous trend. Disfigured corpses, severed heads and limbs,                   and tortured bodies cogently appear as threats to our own existence,                   but what tempers this danger is Goya and the Chapmans&#8217;                   use of comic irony and visual puns as a means of making this                   reality more bearable. If we still suffer from a disease that                   could ultimately lead to our own demise, a disease whose symptoms                   Goya was first to describe, then Jake and Dinos Chapman have                   reified and revised the degenerative symptoms of that same syndrome.                 </p>      </td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td height="325" valign="bottom"> <div align="center">           <p><a href="../index.html" class="headerbig">P<em>ART</em></a><br>            <a href="../index.html" class="header">home</a></p>        </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td>      <td colspan="4"><font class="seventh" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>        © 2004 P<i>ART</i> and Frank G.
