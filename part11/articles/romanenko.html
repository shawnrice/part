Published in 1923, the poem <em>Pro                   Eto (About This)</em>, composed by Vladimir Mayakovsky with                   corresponding illustrations by Rodchenko, was the first Mayakovsky                   poem illustrated by the artist. Authorship of &#8220;constructivist                   Rodchenko&#8221; was announced at the beginning of the book,                   emphasizing the uniqueness and self-sufficiency of the illustrations.                   It was the first book in the history of art illustrated with                   photomontage. The montages were composed from cutouts of magazines                   and photographs, including those of Mayakovsky, Lili Brik, the                   woman he loved, and their contemporaries. Never before had images                   of the actual people described in a poem been used to illustrate                   it. </p>                <p>Identical views and shared ideology turned Rodchenko and Mayakovsky                   into friends almost immediately after their first meeting in                   1920.[1] Mayakovsky had a great respect and appreciation for                   Rodchenko&#8217;s style. In early 1923 they became close collaborators                   in advertisement production. The poet and the artist were also                   in contact as members of the <em>Lef</em> group, for which Rodchenko                   became the art editor of the magazine. It was not a coincidence                   that Mayakovsky asked Rodchenko to design and illustrate the                   publication of his recently finished poem.</p>                <p>The complicated combination of artistic, social and personal                   reasons stands behind Rodchenko&#8217;s drastic shift to graphic                   design and to photomontage in 1923. Rodchenko had an extraordinary                   sensitivity to new ideas. <em>Pro Eto</em>&#8217;s illustrations                   were created with clear awareness of commercial advertising,                   photojournalism, Berlin Dada experiments and most importantly                   Russian avant-garde cinema. <em>Pro Eto</em> is a result of                   Rodchenko&#8217;s ability to synthesize and to invent. </p>                <table width="466" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="272"><img src="images/romanenka1.jpg" width="272" height="402"></td>                    <td width="10" class="maintext">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="170" class="maintext">Fig. 1.

In 1923, changes in state politics concerning                   the arts, paralleled by changes in the art world itself, started                   to take place. The extreme aesthetic experiments of Rodchenko                   and his fellow artists were almost illegible for the general                   public. Enthusiasts of the new life and new culture, avant-garde                   artists moved into graphic design to stay connected to the new                   society that they strongly believed in. Parallel to that development,                   by 1923 easel painting and realism were restricted to only the                   state-approved artistic style. Soon it became so aggressive                   that photomontage, and later photography, would provide the                   only way to represent reality while avoiding the painterly realism.[2]                   For Mayakovsky and for Rodchenko <em>Pro Eto</em> was an attempt                   to hold their positions as avant-garde artists and to prove                   that there was a place for their vision in the changing society.                 </p>                <p><em>Pro Eto</em> is overloaded with historical significance.                   Yet no less importantly it is a work of art with remarkable                   aesthetic and conceptual quality. In this paper I will attempt                   to emphasize the highly original formal solutions and strong                   conceptual content of Rodchenko&#8217;s illustrations. I will                   point up how attentive the artist was to the ideas of the poet                   and how delicately he treated the controversial subject-matter                   of the poem.</p>                <table width="463" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="276"><img src="images/romanenka2.jpg" width="276" height="399"></td>                    <td width="10" class="maintext">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="177" class="maintext">Fig. 2. Photomontage 8, <em>Love</em></td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p>Vladimir Mayakovsky and Lili Brik are one of the most remarkable                   pairs of lovers in history and in literature. The role of Lili                   and her husband Osip Brik in Mayakovsky&#8217;s life has attracted                   the attention of serious scholars as well as scandalmongers.                   Osip Brik was the closest friend of the poet. The three of them                   lived together for almost ten years. Mayakovsky always called                   the Briks his family, and Lily his wife. For some their relationship                   is an example of corrupt morals; for others they represent a                   bold attempt to live by a new type of love and friendship. The                   poem was written during two-month separation of Mayakovsky from                   Lili Brik in the winter 1922-1923. The separation was her initiative,                   and was willfully accepted by the poet. The main suggested reasons                   for this were his jealousy and her preaching of free love. The                   poem expresses the troubled state of mind of the suffering poet.                   Although the personal relationships served as a lyrical springboard                   for the story, the poem was developed to deal with the universal                   problem of love and social relationships in the new Soviet society.                   Five years after the revolution, which Mayakovsky embraced with                   all his heart, came the New Economic Policy, and all that he                   had fought against seemed to be resurrected. The black-marketers,                   private entrepreneurs, and bureaucracy all affected the poet                   deeply.[3] For him the extreme privacy of the subject was the                   only language capable of expressing his universal questioning                   of the significance of life. </p>                <p>Each photomontage is an illustration of a corresponding part                   of the poem presented as a complex kaleidoscope of its imagery,                   direct and indirect meanings, metaphors and suggestions. By                   condensing the compositional elements, Rodchenko captured the                   tension and the vivid ideas of the poem. The constructive arrangement                   of organic and inorganic, dynamic and static objects functions                   as a visual analysis of reality.[4] The montage component of                   photomontage is a means of destabilizing that reality and calling                   its legitimacy into question.</p>                <p><strong>Montage 8. Part III Application To&#8230; &#8220;Love&#8221;                   </strong></p>                <p> The theme of Love&#8217;s immunity to <em>byt</em> (Russian                   for &#8220;everyday life,&#8221; routine, inertia, philistine                   way of existence) and Love&#8217;s power to save the world is                   repeated throughout the illustrations. Last photomontage, Montage                   8, is a pinnacle of the sequence of the illustrations leading                   to the culmination of the poem. Lily&#8217;s face at the top                   left corner dominates this montage. The line beneath reads:                   &quot;It may, may be, some time, some day, along a pathway of                   the Gardens of the Zoo she too- for she loved animals- will                   also the Gardens re-enter/smiling like that photo in the desk                   of my room.&quot;[5]</p>                <p>Mayakovsky actually kept on his desk a photograph of a smiling                   Lili, taken in the Berlin Zoo. Yet Rodchenko did not use this                   photograph, but another portrait of Lili in which she does not                   smile, preserving an ideal, romantic, even mysterious aura.                   This obvious contradiction of the text implies that Lili&#8217;s                   face functions not as the poet&#8217;s personal subject of affection,                   and not even as the heroine of the poem, but as a symbol of                   victorious image of Love for All, described in subsequent lines:                   &quot;So that love won&#8217;t be a lackey there/ of livelihood,                   / wedlock, / lust/ or worse. / Decrying bed, / forsaking the                   fireside chair, / so that love shall flood the universe.&quot;[6]</p>                <table width="463" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="279"><img src="images/romanenka3.jpg" width="279" height="408"></td>                    <td width="10" class="maintext">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="174" class="maintext">Fig. 3. Version 1 of Photomontage                       8</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p>It is remarkable that Rodchenko produced this montage in three                   versions. On one of these variants we find two portraits of                   Lili. The image of her wearing a hat and a furry coat is placed                   at the top of the page next to photographs of a bear and a lion.                   Another portrait at the bottom is superimposed on a large picture                   of a road receding into space, framed by straight rows of tall                   trees. The strong diagonal created by the road is paralleled                   by three diagonally-placed three rectangular pictures at the                   top of the page and by diagonally-positioned animal figures                   placed on top of each other at the middle. Attempting to stabilize                   the series of diagonals, the artist constructed a vertical line                   of images at the right edge of the page. </p>                <p>A more successful whole was achieved in the second version.                   Here Rodchenko employed fewer figures. Intersecting planes of                   pictures animate the surface. Yet the unsupported pyramid of                   animals at the bottom of the page breaks the balance of the                   composition and destroys the well-composed arrangement at the                   top. Rodchenko obviously liked the idea of the animal pyramid.                   Possibly he was referring to the mythological belief that the                   earth is flat and rests on the backs of elephants which stand                   on a giant turtle swimming in an ocean that is the universe.                   In this case the pyramid of the animals symbolizes the superstitious,                   irrational and antiscientific old world, which will be destroyed                   in the future.</p>                <p> Rodchenko changed the scheme completely in the published montage.                   The imagery is arranged in a carefully controlled way. Photographs                   taken from different angles and distances intersect each other                   in dynamic yet very balanced horovod, or circular dance, creating                   a unified and vibrant whole. Different compositional devices                   are actively employed by the artist. In this version, however,                   overlapping, diagonals, and contrasts are utilized in a more                   discrete manner. Their elegant and subtler character creates                   an atmosphere of harmony and substance. This peacefulness and                   stability reflects the utopian vision of the future expressed                   in the poem. </p>                <table width="462" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="262"><img src="images/romanenka4.jpg" width="262" height="395"></td>                    <td width="10" class="maintext">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="190" class="maintext">Fig. 4.

The jealousy turned the hero into                   the bear earlier in the poem thus the bear in the cage symbolizes                   that there will be no jealousy in the future. He probably rejected                   the pictures of the receding road and the paradisiacal landscape                   as too sentimental. Showing different kinds of noble animals                   and utilizing the fact that animals are immune to human vice,                   Rodchenko successfully illustrated the poet&#8217;s prediction                   that in the future there will be no place for vulgar philistinism,                   no small-mindedness, no idleness. And finally, emerging from                   behind and dominating the whole is the image of Love, which                   for Mayakovsky was &#8220;the main thing.&#8221; Mayakovsky                   wrote: &#8220;My poetry, my actions, everything else stems from                   it. Love is the heart of everything.&#8221;[7] Nevertheless                   what looks like a &#8220;love poem&#8221; is in fact a poem                   about the search for a new self more consistent with ideals                   of the new society, a search for Love in its universal, all-embracing                   sense, Love for all and for everyone. As Feodor Dostoevsky believed                   that beauty would save the world, Mayakovsky believed that Love                   would do the same. Rodchenko&#8217;s imagery re-enforces the                   poem in which the poet dealt with the tension between personal                   affection, which is possessive, subject to jealousy and suffering,                   and Ideal Love, which is free and beautiful.</p>                <p><strong>The Controversial Aspects of the Illustrations</strong></p>                <p> A tormented personal love affair of the poet presented with                   astonishing sincerity within a poem was extremely controversial                   for that time. Rodchenko&#8217;s photomontage was an integral                   part of the poem; the opinion expressed regarding the written                   words was usually applied to the illustrations. During the period                   of Mayakovsky and Lili&#8217;s separation Rodchenko was in close                   contact with both. Not only did Rodchenko know the context of                   the poem&#8217;s creation, he also witnessed Lili and Mayakovsky&#8217;s                   relationships before the episode of separation. That placed                   him in a difficult situation. It gave him the advantage of a                   more personal understanding of the poem, yet it tested his impartiality.                 </p>                <p>In all his montages Rodchenko carefully avoided any gossiping.                   It was known that during the separation Mayakovsky and Lili                   exchanged short notes. In fact on several occasions Rodchenko                   himself delivered those. In the poem there is a mentioning of                   the notes that connected the hero with his loved one. But Rodchenko                   rejected the version of Montage 5, where he himself is presented                   handing over a note to the heroine. In the accepted variant                   Rodchenko kept the self-portrait but presented himself as an                   inactive participant: a strange dancer on the background next                   to the partying group. Montage 5 is a disapproving comment on                   the artificiality and emptiness of bourgeois material culture.                   It presents the partying guests in the heroine&#8217;s apartment.                   They are the hero&#8217;s friends who forgot about revolution                   and spend their lives dancing and having empty conversations.                   Placing himself in the &#8220;friends&#8221; arena is a brilliant                   artistic statement clearly reflecting Rodchenko&#8217;s self-critique                   and his sharing of Mayakovsky&#8217;s vision expressed in the                   poem. </p>                <table width="464" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="265"><img src="images/romanenka5.jpg" width="265" height="400"></td>                    <td width="10" class="maintext">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="189" class="maintext">Fig. 5. Photomontage 5, <em>Friends</em></td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p>I think that among the reasons for Rodchenko&#8217;s doubts                   and production of the additional versions, the desire to eliminate                   the excessive directness of the references is important. In                   the first version of Montage 8, a picture of a dog reaching                   out for the Lili&#8217;s portrait crowns the top of the animal                   pyramid. Lili and Mayakovsky used to call each other <em>Kisa</em>                   and <em>Schen</em> (Kitten and Puppy).[8] Rodchenko, being a                   close friend, definitely knew about these nicknames. Thus the                   dog on the montage could be a metaphorical representation of                   the poet. Still, one cannot avoid thinking about the puppy-like                   character of his love. This version contains the image of a                   lioness placed at the top right corner, next to the picture                   of the caged bear. The bear refers to the poet&#8217;s transformation                   into the beast earlier in the poem. The lion is a big cat, so                   it could function as a continuance of the parallels to the nicknames,                   this time Lili&#8217;s. But it could also be a commentary on                   her relationship with the poet, which had a noble yet cruel                   character. This association is supported by the juxtaposition                   of Lili&#8217;s portrait at the bottom of this montage with                   the picture of a baby goat. The baby goat, a symbol of sacrifice,                   could refer to the sacrificial, altruistic love that will rule                   in the future. However it also could be perceived as a reference                   to the sacrificial love of the poet to the beautiful but too                   proud and independent Lili. It is possible that Rodchenko disliked                   the potential interpretation of this version in terms of the                   heroes&#8217; actual personalities and relationships, in another                   version he avoids such direct references. At the top, unified                   by a black background, we find Lili&#8217;s portrait, a picture                   of a tiger, and a picture of a baby goat. In the context of                   the final scene of the poem it might be associated with the                   harmony and peace that will exist in the future. It also leads,                   however, to a predator-prey contrast, and the viewer might be                   tempted to see the combination of baby goat-tiger as a parallel                   to Mayakovsky and Lili&#8217;s relationship. In the published                   version, Rodchenko kept the image of a lion and added a picture                   of three lion cubs, but eliminated the image of the baby goat,                   thereby dismissing this predator-prey association. </p>                <p>As mentioned before, one of the most controversial aspects                   of Rodchenko&#8217;s illustrations was the use of the photographs                   of the real people involved in the story. One of the most aggressive                   criticisms of Mayakovsky and Rodchenko&#8217;s work, in fact,                   came from Nickolay Chuzhak, the member of <em>Lef</em>. In his                   essay &#8221;From Illusion to Materiality&#8221; (1925), Chuzhak                   blamed Rodchenko for imposing the naturalism of the poem on                   the reader by showing the poet himself as a hero.[9] He expressed                   harsh disapproval of the use of real places and real facts that                   in his opinion made the poem &#8220;weakly&#8221; personal and                   helpless because of these naturalistic qualities. However, Rodchenko&#8217;s                   use of real portraits demonstrates his interest in the documentary                   character of the image and belief in the relevancy and even                   necessity of documentary for the new society. The way these                   photographs were selected and presented clearly opposes Chuzhak&#8217;s                   statement.</p>                <table width="493" border="0">                  <tr>                     <td width="270"><img src="images/romanenka6.jpg" width="270" height="407"></td>                    <td width="10" class="maintext">&nbsp;</td>                    <td width="213" class="maintext">Fig. 6. Version of Photomontage                       5</td>                  </tr>                </table>                <p>Some of Lily&#8217;s photographs were taken from family albums.                   Rodchenko intentionally chose those in which she looks directly                   into the camera confronting the viewer. For almost all the portraits                   in which Mayakovsky has posed, his poses and expression clearly                   indicate his awareness of being portrayed. The &#8220;theatrical&#8221;                   character of the photographs opposes any voyeuristic suggestions.                   These portraits function as metaphors, as almost abstract elements.                   Their documentary quality is used to create a sense of surprise                   in the observer. This surprise forces the individual to call                   his reality into question and to suggest that since those are                   the real people represented, the reality described/depicted                   is also real. Rodchenko wrote: &#8220;The photograph of hungry                   people influences stronger than a drawing of them,&#8221;[10]                   and so, in the same manner, a picture of real people, struggling                   with inertia and philistinism, places the viewer directly into                   the reality of this struggle. Thus the reader is an intellectually                   active part of the poem. According to Sergey Eisenstein, the                   director and the theoretician of the Russian avant-garde cinema:                   &#8220;montage involves the creative process, the emotions and                   mind of the spectator. The spectator is compelled to proceed                   along the same creative path that the author traveled in creating                   the image (idea).&#8221;[11] Mayakovsky&#8217;s poetry demands                   the same effort from the reader. The illustrations for the poem                   are charged with seriously conceived symbolism and reveal how                   acutely Rodchenko was involved with the conceptual scheme of                   his illustrations. Rodchenko&#8217;s photomontages correspond                   to Mayakovsky style and undergird his images (hyperbolic, lyrical,                   emotive, satirical) with exceptional force. They represent one                   of the most successful examples of balanced relationships between                   illustration and text. It is indeed a product of the most fruitful                   collaboration between the poet and the artist.</p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>                <p> 1. Factually it was the second time that Rodchenko met Mayakovsky.                   Before he had seen him in Kazan&#8217; in 1914, where Mayakovsky                   came with group of Futurists to spread Futurism.</p>                <p> 2. Cristina Lodder, Russian Constructivism (New Haven, CT.:                   Yale University Press, 1983), 181. According to Lodder, the                   shift to photography gradually eroded the Constructivist principles                   which inspired it. Thus the photograph and photomontage were                   at once a symptom and a cause of the decline of Constructivism                   and of its interesting compromise with existing reality. However,                   it should be clarified that, while moving away from painting,                   Rodchenko successfully transferred the main principles of Constructivism                   into his design and photomontage. Emphasis on structure, clarity                   of forms, and the importance of factura remained the distinctive                   qualities of his works.</p>                <p> 3.
