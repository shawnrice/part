Two years earlier, Los Angeles                   Realtor made a similar connection between the city&#8217;s physical                   growth and the growth of its communications infrastructure.                   But as the Realtor reminded its readers, the surge in the demand                   for telephones was not solely a product of the city&#8217;s                   recent growth spurt. Between 1912 and 1918, the journal reported,                   Hollywood went from 1,472 to 9,266 subscribers, &#8220;a gain                   of 535 percent in the period of six years.&#8221; Furthermore,                   the Realtor declared, this increase was &#8220;typical of practically                   every section of this super-city.&#8221; </p>                <p> What these articles suggest in their comparison of telephone                   expansion to city growth is that early advances in telecommunications                   might be added to the catalog of technological marvels whose                   integration into urban areas has become inseparable from the                   definition of the metropolis itself. Indeed, the telephone came                   of age at the same time as the tall building and the electric                   light, it traversed the American city in a web more complex                   than commuter train lines or sewer systems, and it helped establish                   international commerce as we know it today. As geographer Aharon                   Kellerman states, out of all the modern advances used to gauge                   a city&#8217;s growth, telecommunications has the most extensive                   geography. </p>                <p>In this paper, I&#8217;d like to explore a few ways in which                   the telephone informed Los Angeles&#8217; own unique geography,                   both physical and social. How, for example, did the flow of                   information enabled by early telephone services support economic                   concerns, and thus physical settlement, in both the city center                   and surrounding region? How did the introduction of the telephone                   contribute to the way Angelenos perceived city space? Finally,                   in what ways did advertising and the media align phone use with                   notions of &#8220;Westerness&#8221; and &#8220;Southern California                   living?&#8221; </p>                <p><strong>Building the City</strong></p>                <p>Starting in the early 1980s, a growing interest in the role                   advances in telecommunications play in shaping urban form brought                   new attention to Los Angeles&#8217; urban physiognomy. With                   an eye on the region&#8217;s inclination toward establishing                   multiple commercial centers surrounded by high-density developments,                   Los Angeles&#8217; polynucleated structure seems symptomatic                   of similar socio-geographic transformations in restructuring                   capitalist cityscapes around the globe. These changes in the                   urban landscape reflect, in sociologist Manuel Castells&#8217;                   words, a greater dependence on an efficient &#8220;space of                   flows&#8221; connecting dispersed informational &#8220;hubs,&#8221;                   a great virtual communications web that ties together the &#8220;technopoles&#8221;                   of a new global economy. L.A. emerges from these discussions                   as one of the quintessential &#8220;technopoles&#8221;&#8212;or                   as other urban thinkers might have it, a prototypical &#8220;edge                   city&#8221; (Joel Garreau), &#8220;exopolis&#8221; (Edward Soja),                   &#8220;midopolis&#8221; (Joel Kotkin), or incipient e-topia                   (William J. Mitchell). But although a growing interest in communications                   has placed new importance on the need to reexamine the spatial                   patterns of Los Angeles&#8217; unyielding development, a persistent                   contemporary focus leaves blank the role foundational communications                   systems played in the physical formation and social dynamics                   of the city over time. Current scholarship provides an opportunity                   to speculate on how telecommunications contribute to the shape                   and function of the L.A. of the future, but it also signals                   the need to reinterpret how early means of transferring information,                   via the telephone, influenced L.A.&#8217;s socio-spatial formation                   in the past.</p>                <p> When mentioned in this dialogue, the telephone is traditionally                   presented as having a decentralizing influence in that it facilitates                   the separation of manufacturing and managerial concerns by enabling                   industry to relocate to more affordable land outside of urban                   areas. Sociologists like Roger Burlingame, however, also cite                   the telephone&#8217;s role in permitting the physical concentration                   of people and buildings in dense city centers, in part by alleviating                   foot traffic in large structures and on city streets. L.A.&#8217;s                   unique urban development during the early years of its expansion                   reflect both of these historical growth patterns and is thus                   of particular interest when tracing the telephone&#8217;s relationship                   to the maturation of that city. From the 1880s through the 1930s,                   when the telephone was being rapidly integrated into daily life,                   Los Angeles was forming in both a centralized and decentralized                   manner: it possessed an active cultural, commercial and civic                   center in what is now downtown, while simultaneously experiencing                   unprecedented growth in the surrounding region. </p>                <p>As Manuel Castells suggests, however, it is not technology                   itself but primarily the economic sphere, where advances in                   communications are felt, which fundamentally affects spatial                   structure. At the turn of the twentieth century, the bulk of                   the region&#8217;s commercial activity centered on professional                   services, real estate, trade (mostly oil), and agriculture,                   but not manufacturing and financial services, with which telephone                   use at the time is generally aligned. Urban thinkers considering                   the (sub)urbanization of the country post-1960, however, recognize                   business and producer services as the sectors most impacted                   by communications, particularly in their need to facilitate                   flows of information between disparate locales. This parallel                   may help explain the rapid growth of telephone interests in                   a region that, in comparison to major economic centers in the                   East and Midwest, was still relatively small but was characterized                   by a rapidly growing and spatially dispersed populace. The statistics                   are indeed impressive: Los Angeles demonstrated the telephone                   only one year after Bell&#8217;s famous test drive in 1876,                   established its first phone company in 1881, and saw greater                   phone use per capita by 1895 than anywhere else in the country,                   including Boston, Chicago, and New York. By 1905 it outstripped                   Sweden for the world record. </p>                <p>L.A.&#8217;s initial subscribers were men with enough capital                   to indulge in experimental technology and with the daring disposition                   of the western pioneer. The adventurous included Hellman, Haas                   &amp; Company and Harris Newmark &amp; Company, both grocers;                   M. Dodsworth for the Los Angeles Packing Company, movers; and                   J. M. Griffith &amp; Company, lumber, Perry, Woodwarth &amp;                   Company, lumber, and Deming, Palmer &amp; Company, the local                   timber mill. Shopping, building, and transporting: these were                   the initial uses ascribed to the telephone and they continued                   to be the most consistent. </p>                <p>In the years before improvements in repeaters and wires made                   it practical to extend lines long distances, hookups connected                   these businesses within a six-mile radius in the center of town.                   When such technological obstacles were overcome, the telephone                   continued to be regularly employed as a boon to downtown development.                   The press significantly aided this effort, particularly the                   Los Angeles Times, whose parent company, the Times-Mirror Corporation,                   founded in 1881, had strong interests in real estate downtown                   and communications in general. For example, the Times placed                   pressures on outlying communities to hook up to downtown or                   risk business losses: </p>                <p>In Los Angeles County this [telephone] development has been                   perhaps greater than anywhere else&#8230;The telephone was practically                   unknown here four years ago. To-day its use is an indispensable                   necessity to business and professional persons and for those                   who live in the suburbs to be without a telephone is almost                   as bad as to be out in the woods. </p>                <p>Hooking up to the city center, the Times thus hinted, supported                   the economic life of growing communities around the county,                   thereby encouraging the widespread diffusion of the new device.                   Although historian Robert Fogelson describes how the impact                   of transportation installations and other utilities on the spread                   of L.A. was particularly profound when it developed into a metropolis                   after 1885, the telephone, which was widely installed in the                   central city in 1881 and linked to the outlying county by 1883,                   may have provided the communications infrastructure needed to                   support subsequent growth in the years before the interurban                   railroad and road improvements facilitated practical travel.                   As the Times recognized by 1882, &#8220;the utility of such                   a [telephone extension] project for the accommodation of business                   between adjacent towns must commend itself to everyone.&#8221;                 </p>                <p>The active campaign for telephone connections by Angelenos                   in all parts of the region reflect recognition of the phone&#8217;s                   usefulness to outlying towns. Only one year after the formation                   of Los Angeles Telephone in 1881, many local papers encouraged                   the city to extend a line of her system to the neighboring towns                   of Downey, Anaheim, Orange, and Santa Ana, and continue as far                   as San Diego. Another line was to reach through Pasadena, San                   Marino, and San Gabriel. The port of San Pedro was of course                   important, and a line there would take in many settlements,                   like Compton, along the way. By 1883 every one of these lines,                   except for the one to San Diego, had been completed, in addition                   to a line to the burgeoning beach towns of Santa Monica and                   Long Beach. Hence, before commuter train service linked the                   county together and electric lights illuminated it, the telephone                   crisscrossed Los Angeles as a sign of commercial, technological                   and social progress. A comparison of electric interurban train                   extensions and telephone extensions throughout the county illustrate                   this timeline. </p>                <p>Connections were particularly important for growing farming                   communities. Take, for example, the experience in Pomona. Located                   about thirty miles from downtown and fifty miles from the port                   at San Pedro, the telephone allowed Pomona&#8217;s agriculturalists                   to remain competitive in fruit exports, for which it was rapidly                   building a national reputation. Although Sunset Telephone (the                   successor to Los Angeles Telephone) installed Pomona&#8217;s                   first exchange in 1885, by 1895 the burgeoning community&#8217;s                   fifty installations did not meet the increasing demand. Such                   deficiencies were particularly frustrating to citrus growers,                   who were concerned that the lack of coverage in the rural areas                   would depress their exporting businesses and devastate their                   town. </p>                <p>To remedy this, a group of progressive farmers organized an                   independent telephone company, incorporated as the Pomona Valley                   Telephone and Telegraph Union, in September 1902. Construction                   was financed entirely by local capital, and although the system                   was built for five hundred subscribers, within two years the                   company had more than one thousand stations with lines extending                   to Claremont, La Verne, San Dimas, and Chino. Even after Pomona                   was connected to the interurban train system in 1904, Pomona                   Telephone was so central to the social and economic life of                   that community that by 1912 it successfully purchased Sunset&#8217;s                   competing exchange. </p>                <p>Although telephone access was indispensable to the farmer,                   the most adamant proponent of telephone service should logically                   have been the real estate developer, who was heavily involved                   in subdividing and improving Los Angeles&#8217; vast tracks                   of land. In Glendale, for example, Leslie C. Brand, who formed                   the San Fernando Valley Land and Development Company with Henry                   Huntington, also organized and became president of the local                   telephone concern, the San Fernando Valley Home Telephone Company.                   When Brand ran into trouble trying to secure rights-of-way for                   the Big Red Cars, he concentrated on updating Sunset&#8217;s                   original 1899 exchange and then extended telephone connections                   to La Cresenta, La Ca&ntilde;ada, Burbank and Lankershim. <br>                  In general, however, it is extremely difficult to track the                   specific activities and attitudes of real estate interests toward                   telephone installations. In part, this lack of record may relate                   to the speculative nature of land development during the first                   few boom periods of Los Angeles&#8217; growth, which was a private                   and relatively autonomous affair. As in many cities, municipal                   pressures and private efforts encouraged utilities services                   as a means of raising property values in town and encouraging                   real estate sales in surrounding regions. However, municipal                   agencies in Los Angeles did not regulate the actual improvement                   of property, and as a result, the pace of utilities expansion                   depended to a large degree on the willingness of private enterprise                   to install connections. </p>                <p>Unfortunately, Los Angeles&#8217; developers often had trouble                   securing telephone, as well as electric and gas installations.                   Many utility companies were not willing to risk financial loss                   by moving into new territory, and most developers could not                   afford to enter the utility business themselves. In 1902 the                   Los Angeles Board of Public Utilities enacted regulations meant                   to protect utility interests by giving subdividers the right                   to service only if &#8220;a tender of money sufficient to defray                   the cost be made to the company.&#8221; Most small-scale developers                   were unable to afford this investment, and because subdivision                   was often a speculative affair only the bare minimum in improvements                   were made before selling lots. </p>                <p>Larger companies did exert more effort in this direction. In                   San Fernando Valley, for example, the Sunset Company required                   that Los Angeles Suburban Homes purchase $10,000 of its bonds.                   L.A. Homes also appealed to the Southern California Gas and                   Edison Electric Companies, each of which made their own demands,                   but in the end decided that only electric and telephone services                   were most essential to a successful return on their land investment.                   They thus met Edison&#8217;s requests and bought $20,000 of                   Sunset&#8217;s securities. </p>                <p>As the most powerful land developer in Southern California,                   Henry Huntington&#8217;s attitude toward telephone services                   might be used to gauge its relevance to the subdivision game.                   Huntington owned thirty-six independent telephone companies                   from California to Tennessee&#8212;including investments in                   L.A.&#8217;s Home Telephone&#8212;making his interests the largest                   in the country. Never one to think small, in 1908 Huntington                   hinted at plans to establish an &#8220;interocean telephone&#8221;                   that would link L.A. via a southern route to the east coast,                   thereby establishing Los Angeles, and not San Francisco, as                   the economic center of California. Within Los Angeles, it is                   not clear to what extent Huntington took part in decisions made                   by the Home Telephone or other local independents connected                   with his land, like San Fernando Telephone in Glendale. However,                   his railroad interests alone mandated close alignments. The                   telephone was used to maintain the efficient running of lines                   by tracking miles traveled, maintenance needs and scheduling.                   As the Times explained, railroad dispatching in the city was                   brought to perfection by private telephone wires that reached                   wherever the interurban trains extended. </p>                <p><strong>Imagining the City</strong></p>                <p> By the turn of the twentieth century the telephone had thoroughly                   penetrated greater Los Angeles, and its presence likely began                   to shape the way Angelenos perceived city space. As the first                   modern convenience to thoroughly link the downtown area, and                   then to extend those links to the rest of the county, initial                   installations signaled pioneering efforts to bind the region                   into a comprehensive whole. As the interurban railroad would                   do shortly, and the freeway and subway system would replicate                   much later, telephone lines crisscrossed, and by 1883 radiated                   around and out of the central business district. In so doing,                   it helped establish the city center as the nucleus of the region,                   both physically and psychologically. </p>                <p>Early diagrams helped telephone workers and citizens alike                   visualize these links. They usually portrayed downtown as a                   large circle, with arms linking this core, via trunk lines,                   to other &#8220;centers.&#8221; In real life, poles were erected                   along dusty downtown streets and then followed unimproved cart                   roads out to surrounding communities. Standing alone in the                   widely undeveloped countryside, these poles and wires would                   have functioned as palpable signposts of L.A.&#8217;s move into                   the future, curious colonnades of leafless timber lining the                   path to downtown. </p>                <p>These physical paths also signaled new virtual paths that could                   facilitate travel without requiring one to leave the home or                   office. The general importance of the telephone for navigating                   the vast, horizontal region is illustrated in part by the constant                   battle for reasonable rates, which remained consistently lower                   than anywhere else in the country. Beginning in the 1880s, the                   phone companies contributed to this telephonic reading of the                   city by trying to organize greater Los Angeles into &#8220;zones&#8221;                   and basing rates on calls made within and between these sectors.                   For example, while telephone traffic eventually followed any                   number of paths around the region, for many years the bulk of                   calls were directed toward downtown. Telephone interests were                   thus under constant pressure to lower &#8220;traveling&#8221;                   rates to this &#8220;zone 1&#8221; from cities as far as Santa                   Ana and Palos Verdes, much as Huntington&#8217;s railroad was                   compelled to provide free transfers between suburban and downtown                   stops. In 1912 the public was clearly winning. As the Board                   of Public Utilities stated, &#8220;Few cities have such intimate                   relations with so many outlying settlements and such ease and                   low cost of telephone communication therewith.&#8221; Getting                   around the city, it seemed, was conceived as a telephone issue                   as much as it was a transportation issue.</p>                <p> Starting in the late 1920s, the Bell Company began encouraging                   the housewife to become one such telephone traveler by transforming                   the consumer image of the telephone from that of a business                   necessity to that of an accommodation. Part of its &#8220;comfort                   and convenience&#8221; advertising campaign, for example, strove                   to make it &#8220;the style&#8221; for an average home to have                   two or three telephone extensions and an affluent home to have                   as many as fifteen. These ads, placed in architecture, real                   estate, and women&#8217;s magazines, encouraged telephone installations                   as part of the homebuilding process. Pacific Bell, for example,                   informed the housewife that their Free Architects and Buildings                   Department could help her to defeat the inconveniences of space                   and time by installing extensions in every room of the house.                   This easy access, she was told, would take the &#8220;run&#8221;                   out of running her household. </p>                <p>Part of Bell&#8217;s project was to insert the telephone into                   studies conducted by domestic scientists like Lillian Gilbreth,                   who applied Frederick Winslow Taylor&#8217;s time-motion principles                   for factory production to the home. The telephone, Bell suggested,                   facilitated the efficient organization of errands and social                   commitments by enabling the housewife (or her servants) to order                   goods for delivery, call repairmen, and schedule activities&#8212;a                   modern necessity, they told her, that no disciplined housewife                   would do without. She was, in other words, encouraged to imagine                   the city as a space of consumption, and the telephone as a tool                   with which to more efficiently navigate it. This campaign was                   not specific to Los Angeles, but Western lifestyle journals                   like Better Homes and Gardens and Sunset Magazine actively encouraged                   this perception of urban space in columns that acted as &#8220;guide                   books&#8221; on how to negotiate the rules and practices for                   using the telephone. </p>                <p><strong>Advertising the City</strong></p>                <p> It took until the 1950s, however, for Bell to align the modernization                   of the interior of the house with modern architecture itself.                   These ads were often regionally specific, selecting house types                   that were associated with specific parts of the country and                   architects that would testify to the benefits of such pre-phone                   planning. Pacific Bell ads in California-based journals like                   Western Architect and Engineer, for example, featured the cutting-edge                   house designs for which Southern California had become known.                   In this particular rendering, SoCal &#8220;modernity&#8221;                   is signaled through the clean simple lines of a board and batten                   plywood fa&ccedil;ade, large picture windows, the far reach                   of an open trellis that filters the hot sun, and, of course,                   an interior thoroughly wired with telephone conduits. </p>                <p>In a city known for its eclectic collection of fantastic mansions,                   however, almost every genre was represented, while L.A.&#8217;s                   celebrated but less radical architects were more likely to be                   featured as spokespeople for the conservative Bell monopoly.                   One 1930 issue of Architecture magazine announced that Carleton                   M. Winslow&#8217;s streamlined-moderne house contained ten built-in                   telephone outlets, including an extension in the room most frequented                   by the typical Angeleno: the garage. In this ad, Ralph C. Flewelling                   notes the boost in resale value telephone extensions bring to                   the Spanish-style residence he built for a family in Beverly                   Hills. In a town where the truly hip changed residences like                   they changed attire, this was an important selling point.</p>                <p> In L.A., even Mickey Mouse&#8217;s new Tudor castle was thoroughly                   pre-wired, complete with a poolside extension for Disney&#8217;s                   biggest star. Hollywood, it seemed, was filled with people talking                   on the phone, particularly the barrage of cinematic personalities                   who were pictured gabbing at the Wilshire golf course, chatting                   in the gardens of their Beverly Hills homes, and passing on                   the word about the latest product. On screen, the telephone                   appeared in classy, black-lacquer attire, but with the advent                   of color models, it also began to don a more fantastic wardrobe                   of gold, white, and powder blue. The movies were instrumental                   in putting casual telephone use in the eye of the public, and,                   in turn, the public soon came to associate the telephone with                   what many saw as the decadence and frivolity of L.A. living.                 </p>                <p>Los Angeles&#8217; laid-back reputation, however, had been                   established well before Hollywood became inseparable from L.A.                   in the public imagination. It had been a key aspect of the original                   booster campaign to advertise the region&#8217;s resort-like                   features. As the Great Depression wore on, architectural trends                   that paralleled the scientific management of the home were aligned                   with the small house and its low-maintenance family, an association                   that melded nicely with the notion of the &#8220;simplicity&#8221;                   of Western living. This association had already appeared by                   1910 with the nationwide popularity of the California bungalow                   and the outdoor lifestyle it represented. When Bell initiated                   its &#8220;convenience&#8221; campaign a few decades later,                   it seized on the bungalow as the quintessential middle class                   home: in a series of ads released in architecture journals in1937,                   for example, the architect is asked to consider the telephone                   needs of the fictitious &#8220;Bailie Family&#8221; who have                   requested &#8220;a small home of the California bungalow type.&#8221;                 </p>                <p>After WWII, the media focused more closely on the backyard                   as the locus for the recent obsession with exaggerated family                   fun. Once again, the Southern California lifestyle seemed to                   meld particularly well with these new ideals; ads by Pacific                   Bell actively cultivated this image by suggesting telephone                   extensions for outdoor areas. In one ad, for example, a relaxed,                   pipe-smoking husband replaces the boardroom and suit and tie                   for the lawn chair and Hawaiian T-shirt. Plucking a pear from                   his abundant fruit tree with one hand, he leaves his other free                   to answer a conveniently located outdoor extension. &#8220;Here                   in the West,&#8221; the ad reads, &#8220;where pleasant, relaxed                   living has become a custom, built-in telephone facilities are                   a feature every home-owner goes for.&#8221; And in this 1955                   ad run in Western Architect and Engineer, the builder is asked                   to consider the functional needs of &#8220;Big Chief Hot Stuff&#8221;:                   &#8220;Especially here in the West,&#8221; the ad states, &#8220;where                   we live outdoors a lot, they want to be able to talk on the                   patio or even by the barbecue.&#8221; </p>                <p>As Mike Davis so aptly suggests, however, Los Angeles is not                   only a land of sunshine but of noir. Who better to conclude                   with, then, than Raymond Chandler, whose L.A.-based crime fiction                   novels provide a seemingly unending amount of references to                   the telephone&#8217;s role in L.A.-living. Philip Marlowe, Chandler&#8217;s                   shamus star, is a true Angeleno detective: he navigates the                   underbelly of L.A. from behind the wheel of his car, a tool                   so indispensable to him that it has often been characterized                   as a kind of physical appendage. A close reading of Chandler&#8217;s                   books, however, reveal the telephone to be as important as the                   automobile to navigating the physical and social spaces of the                   city. Given the opportunity, Marlowe will always avoid driving                   if he can telephone instead, as it is a much easier way to get                   around. Entire chapters revolve around telephone conversations                   during which the subtleties of a voice or Marlowe&#8217;s handling                   of the receiver function as key descriptive devices. As for                   most Angelenos, events in Marlow&#8217;s life are often triggered                   by the ringing, or not ringing, of the telephone. The style                   of telephone a suspect owns is an important indication of their                   character, as in the Lady in the Lake, where the playboy&#8217;s                   gilded French model points to the decadent lifestyle of Hollywood                   denizens: &#8220;I looked at the phone,&#8221; Marlow sneers,                   &#8220;It was on a small table against the wall beside the fireplace.                   It had a long cord so that Mr. Lavery could be lying on his                   back on the davenport, a cigarette between his smooth brown                   lips, a tall cool one at the table at his side, and plenty of                   time for a nice long cozy conversation with a lady friend.&#8221;                   For those without a phone, well, that just indicates one&#8217;s                   socio-economic status. By the time Chandler wrote The Long Goodbye,                   one of his most biting L.A. novels, Marlowe has formed a clear                   opinion about telephone use in Los Angeles: &#8220;There is                   something compulsive about a telephone. The gadget-ridden man                   of our age loves it, loathes it, and is afraid of it. But he                   always treats it with respect, even when he is drunk.&#8221;                   In Los Angeles, Marlowe has finally figured out, &#8220;The                   telephone is a fetish.&#8221; </p></td>              <td width="5">&nbsp; </td>            </tr>          </tbody>        </table></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td height="325" valign="bottom"> <div align="center">           <p><a href="../index.html" class="headerbig">P<em>ART</em></a><a href="../../index.html" class="headerbig"></span><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>            <span class="header">home</span></font></a></p>        </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td>      <td colspan="4"><font class="seventh" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>        © 2004 P<i>ART</i> and Emily Bills.
