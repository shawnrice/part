This paper examines a compelling                   image from the suite of drawings, a pair of figures that operate                   on multiple levels and function as complex symbols whose uneasy                   meanings &#8220;float and contradict.&#8221;[2] Scholars have                   categorized <em> Polynesian Beauty and Evil Spirit</em> from                   enigmatic to sinister,[3] and the image has been read as a variation                   of the Temptation theme featuring Eve in liaison with Satan.[4]                   I would like to propose a metaphorical reading for <em>Polynesian                   Beauty and Evil Spirit</em>, by suggesting that allegories can                   be read into the composition which reveal Gauguin&#8217;s concerns                   with gender, religion, and social issues. Drawn to the concept                   of divine androgyny in world religions as a mode to express                   utopian harmony, Gauguin sought balance by addressing extremes                   in his art: male/female, human/divine, man/beast, East/West,                   primitive/civilized, colonizer/colonized, virtue/vice. </p>                <p>While the Biblical tale of Eve and the serpent had long fascinated                   the artist,[5] as in Words of the Devil from 1892, a notable                   shift emerged in Gauguin&#8217;s figural work after living in                   Tahiti for nearly ten years. Rejecting narrative and an earlier                   obsession with Eve as femme fatale responsible for the downfall                   of man, Gauguin&#8217;s mature style evolved into a metaphoric                   language that constructed the Polynesian native as a paradigm                   of virtue, innocence, and unspoiled Tahiti. An education in                   the Catholic seminary provided haunting models of good and evil[6]                   that naturally shaped Gauguin&#8217;s conception of Virtue&#8217;s                   antithesis as a devilish horned figure. His prolific writings                   often mention Virtue and Vice by name, revealing the allure                   of the sacred and profane.[7]</p>                <p>The 1889 canvas entitled Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake                   depicts a highly synthesized dialogue of opposing forces, and                   emphasizes Gauguin&#8217;s intensely subjective outlook. Appearing                   both angelic and demonic, the self-portrait hovers between earthly                   and sacred realms, suggested by the heavenly wings, halo, and                   background of red hellfire. Apples and snake together identify                   the sitter as a fallen angel.[8] The portrait&#8217;s references                   to polarities in religion derive from Gauguin&#8217;s interest                   in esoteric writings and his Theosophical world view, a philosophy                   based upon the notion that all great religions shared similar                   doctrines and essential truths.[9]</p>                <p>The concept of androgyny has existed for centuries in almost                   every religion and time period, evidenced in Western culture                   by the existence of Hellenistic Greek sculpture and writings                   by Plato, Virgil, and others. During the nineteenth century                   this complex concept endured as a theme in art, literature,                   and mysticism, symbolizing perfection through the union of opposites.[10]                   Scholars have shown that the literary androgynous ideal imagined                   by Balzac and P&eacute;ladan affected Gauguin.[11] I would suggest,                   however, that androgynous creator-gods in world religions and                   myths appealed to his Theosophical outlook, and collectively                   established a precedent for him to reconcile dualities in his                   art. Examples of divine androgynes from Indian, African, and                   Asian art were available in Paris.[12] Adopting a highly personal                   approach to religion,[13] he began to conceive of the Tahitians                   in androgynous terms and to articulate the similarities, rather                   than differences, between male and female.[14] A passage from                   his quasi-autobiographical treatise Noa Noa (1893-97) conveys                   his views, </p>                <blockquote>                   <p>&#8220;Together they engage in the same tasks with the same                     activity or the same <br>                    indolence. There is something virile in the women and something                     feminine in <br>                    the men. This similarity of the sexes make their relations                     the easier.&#8221;[15]</p>                </blockquote>                <p>The language of Symbolism stirred Gauguin to elicit a broader                   universal truth by implying meaning through symbols instead                   of merely relying on form to convey his ideas. Whether visualized                   as a mythological god, as in <em>Idol with a Pearl</em>, or                   as a being at one with nature in <em>Where Are You Going?</em>,                   both from 1892, the Tahitian body was chosen as the preferred                   vehicle to indicate divine harmony through an asexual figure.                   The personal value he found in the androgyne theme resonated                   in a letter that guided a friend to aspire to a spiritual state:                 </p>                <blockquote>                   <p>&#8220;You must regard yourself as Androgyne, without sex.                     By that I mean that heart and soul, in short all that is divine,                     must not be the slave of matter, that is, of the body.&#8221;[16]</p>                </blockquote>                <p>In this priestly role,[17] Gauguin linked transcendence beyond                   the natural world with the abstract concept of androgyny to                   symbolize a heightened sense of completeness aligned with spiritual                   perfection. </p>                <p>Pursuing a new artistic voice, Gauguin explored Brittany, Panama,                   and Martinique before relocating in 1891 to Tahiti. Romanticized                   since its so-called &#8220;discovery&#8221; by English explorers                   in 1767 and its annexation by the French in 1843,[18] Tahiti,                   Gauguin believed, would fulfill his lifelong search for the                   exotic ideal, a dream (or delusion) enhanced by fanciful postcards                   that justified the French colonialist enterprise. Gauguin&#8217;s                   preconceived image of an unspoiled arcadia was dissolved after                   he encountered Christianized natives who spoke French and dressed                   in Western clothing.[19]</p>                <p>References to world religions where androgyny figures prominently                   &#8220;provide the context&#8221; for interpreting this image                   as an allegorical web of dualities springing from the Western                   theme of virtue and vice. Resonating with visual contradictions,                   <em>Polynesian Beauty and Evil Spirit</em> is rarely mentioned                   by critics, scholars, or Gauguin himself in relation to the                   fanciful construction of an idyllic world. The calculated structure                   of the composition implies that Gauguin alludes specifically                   to androgyny and also more generally to the notion of harmony                   and balance. </p>                <p>Gauguin&#8217;s letters earnestly described a new printing                   method that he had recently invented. Beginning with two sheets                   of paper, he placed a clean piece directly upon one covered                   in ink. Then, he drew an image in pencil onto the top paper,                   and pulled away the inked sheet below, revealing, in reverse,                   a printed image on the back side. When the <em>Polynesian Beauty                   and Evil Spirit</em> drawing is compared to its inked mirror                   image on the recto, a sharp contrast materializes. The subtle,                   naturalistic shading in the original drawing, created by fine                   blue and brown pencil lines, transmutes into dense, opaque shadows                   on the reverse side. Murky and expressive, the otherworldly                   effect of these inked shadows reflected Gauguin&#8217;s mystical                   vision. Distinctions between &#8220;matter and spirit&#8221;                   evident in his writings parallels the visual imagery.[20] Inspired                   by epinal prints and woodcuts, the crudity and directness of                   the inked &#8220;print&#8221; served to distance the artist                   from the industrialized West and to relate instead to island                   life. </p>                <p>The reclining figure exhibits the most striking change, now                   appearing strangely bearded, with her beauty and femininity                   &#8211; although not her virtue &#8211; negated. By applying                   facial hair to the female form Gauguin implied the fusion of                   sexes, wittily replacing the academic ideal of long, flowing                   hair with a five-o&#8217;clock shadow.[21] Deftly carrying the                   allusion to androgyny further, he dissolved one of her breasts                   into the shadows, destabilizing the revered nude genre, and                   in the process subverting eroticism and desire toward the notoriously                   handsome Tahitians. By invoking the divine androgyne, prevalent                   in both Polynesian and Hindu art, he implied that Enlightenment                   could only be attained by abandoning earthly desire. Gauguin&#8217;s                   letters align virtue with divinity, goodness, purity, and indirectly                   with the androgynous ideal. I will return to the horned figure                   shortly, whose non-human appearance is exaggerated on the inked                   side.</p>                <p> A related image from the original series of ten drawings presents                   the pair standing side-by-side. Frontally posed, it becomes                   easier to determine the male sex of the horned figure, and to                   conclude that Gauguin composed the subjects in gendered terms.                   He presented woman as androgynous native, virtuous and primitive,                   signifying nature; conversely, man appears non-human, horned                   and devilish, as corrupt civilization, personifying culture.                   The compressed space forces our attention onto the iconic figures,                   offered as symbols. The ambiguous connotations are difficult                   to resolve since the only cultural markers to suggest meaning                   are visible in the bodies themselves. Male and female dichotomies                   strongly correlate to colonizer and colonized, representing                   distinct civilizations that intersect but never fuse. This reading                   is underscored by the symmetrical composition itself that, evoking                   stability and balance, distinguishes duality from chaotic opposition.                   In Gauguin&#8217;s world, colonizer and native co-existed in                   harmony, but remained separate, unfused. </p>                <p>Hinduism was perceived as a mysterious and foreign religion                   by most Europeans at the fin-de-si&eacute;cle. Gauguin, I believe,                   alluded to this ancient culture by commingling the visual form                   of Ardhanarisvara, the hermaphroditic Shiva, with the Polynesian                   subject here. Scholars have shown that Gauguin read translated                   Hindu texts during the Paris interlude,[22] and his interest                   in Hindu art has been documented. </p>                <p>Like the religious art of other cultures, all Hindu art struggles                   with the fundamental challenge to convey the divine in concrete                   terms. This sense of the &#8220;unknowable&#8221; nature of                   the deity is especially strong in Hinduism, where it is common                   for a deity to be &#8220;defined&#8221; in terms of &#8220;negatives&#8221;                   since the (unknown) &#8220;positives&#8221; are beyond comprehension.                   Hindu traditions emphasize both representational likeness and                   abstract concepts (another duality), promoting the idea that                   the gods are present in varied forms. This &#8220;indefinable&#8221;                   aspect of the divine encourages a multi-valent interpretation                   (where any one thing can be viewed as body or symbol of the                   deity, just as well as anything else).[23]</p>                <p><em>Ardhanarishvara</em> is an image where two deities, male                   and female, converge.[24] Parvati represents the female goddess                   of abundance, of both food and life itself. Often Parvati is                   shown as &#8220;Lalita,&#8221; identified by the circular mirror                   she carries and her placement in front of a rounded Indian throne-back[25]                   &#8211; two symbols alluded to in Gauguin&#8217;s image. </p>                <p>Careful examination of the iconography of <em>Polynesian Beauty                   and Evil Spirit</em> reveals that Gauguin drew upon the polarity                   of virtue and vice for inspiration, a theme that could be interpreted                   in both pagan and religious terms. Seventeenth-century author                   Cesare Ripa wrote in his text Iconologia that Vice symbolized                   a &#8220;depravity of manners, or that course of action opposed                   to Virtue.&#8221; &#8220;Vice,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;is                   allegorically characterized by the figure of an ugly squinting                   and deformed dwarf&#8230;denot(ing) corruption and perversion                   of principles.&#8221; Conversely, Virtue signified &#8220;moral                   excellence, &#8230;represented by the figure of a graceful young                   woman with a modest air and a steady countenance, dressed in                   white robes, with wings on her shoulders, and the&#8230;sun                   on her breast.&#8221;[26]</p>                <p>Gauguin overturned Ripa&#8217;s Western standard by allegorizing                   the figures in Tahitian terms. A passage from Noa Noa displayed                   his feelings about the natives: </p>                <blockquote>                   <p>&#8220;Their manners (have) a natural innocence, a perfect                     purity. Man and woman are comrades, friends rather than lovers,                     dwelling together almost without cease, in pain as in pleasure,                     and even the very idea of vice is unknown to them.&#8221;[27]</p>                </blockquote>                <p>De-classisized, Gauguin&#8217;s Virtue reclines awkwardly and                   dons exotic rather than traditional Greek attire. Uncultivated                   and primitive, her bare-breasted, tanned body calls to mind                   a Rousseauian &#8220;noble savage,&#8221; while Ripa&#8217;s                   graceful Virtue &#8220;alludes to solidity, truth, and intellectual                   strength.&#8221; Gauguin&#8217;s informally posed indigene suggested                   similar ideals in a radically different way, and represented                   the purity and innocence that he had hoped to find, aligning                   goodness with the primitive, savage, and exotic. </p>                <p>Gauguin&#8217;s drawing relates to a canvas completed four                   years earlier, known today as <em>Queen of Beauty</em> or <em>The                   Noble Woman</em>. His own description remains the best, </p>                <blockquote>                  <p>&#8220;I have just finished a canvas&#8230;that I believe                     to be much better than anything I&#8217;ve done previously:                     a naked queen, reclining on a green rug, a female servant                     gathering fruit, two old men, near the big tree, discussing                     the tree of knowledge; a shore in the background&#8230;.I                     think that I have never made anything of such deep sonorous                     colors.&#8221;[28]</p>                </blockquote>                <p>Dubbed the &#8220;Black Olympia&#8221; by critics,[29] the                   ambitious painting was derived from the notorious nudes by Titian,                   Lucas Cranach, and Manet (and also a Java relief).[30] Curiously,                   these prototypes displayed women of easy virtue. As Heather                   McPherson has observed, the reclining pose itself was associated                   with promiscuity, and Manet&#8217;s scandalous treatment in                   1863 forced the viewer to confront urban prostitution.[31] Gauguin&#8217;s                   own words, however, suggested the opposite when he mused that                   &#8220;Decidedly the savage is nobler than we.&#8221;[32] In                   1895, writer Auguste Strindberg responded negatively to Gauguin&#8217;s                   unusual nudes, claiming, &#8220;You have invented a new earth                   and sky, but I do not feel at ease in your creation&#8230;and                   your Paradise is inhabited by an Eve who is not my ideal.&#8221;[33]</p>                <p>Rejecting the visible world in favor of the visionary, Gauguin&#8217;s                   <em>Queen of Beauty</em> metaphorically aligned an entire race                   with childlike innocence in both the painting and later drawing.                   Poised awkwardly, she half-leans, half-reclines at a decorative                   diagonal across the picture plane.[34] In the drawing, extracted                   from her tropical realm and situated indoors, the figure and                   her pose seem more contrived. Her floral par&eacute;u and fan                   function as exoticized attributes linking the figure nostalgically                   to traditions that no longer existed. Crafted from the indigenous                   materials of bark-cloth and straw, the simple attributes symbolically                   reinstated Oceania&#8217;s unique cultural identity at a time                   when the fabric was mass-produced in France and exported back                   to the colonies.[35] Furthermore, the symbols of par&eacute;u                   and fan reinforced the figure&#8217;s allegorical role as Tahiti                   incarnate.[36]</p>                <p>The position and shape of the fan, traditional accoutrement                   of the coquette,[37] evokes a circular medievalizing halo, although                   Gauguin subverted the religious allusion by obscuring it with                   dense hatchmarks. The hallucinatory feeling of the shading sets                   off the sitter&#8217;s face and creates the illusion that it                   floats in space, detached from the head.</p>                <p> Distinguished as virtue&#8217;s opposite, a horned creature                   set in view peeks over her shoulder, unacknowledged and mysterious.                   Identified as male in the companion print, the horned head is                   accorded the greatest importance, as it similarly is in Tahitian                   art. The earliest depiction of a horned figure in Gauguin&#8217;s                   oeuvre appears in a nearly life-sized carved wooden head dating                   from 1895-97. Unique in his art, this sculpture may represent                   a veiled self-portrait. If so, what does the artist reveal about                   himself? The horned head strongly resembles the most feared                   religious symbol in Christianity, the devil. Gauguin had earlier                   shown himself as Satan in <em>Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake</em>.[38]                   However, the symbolism in the wooden head side-steps clear-cut                   analysis, since the visual tradition of horned pagan beasts                   must be addressed. Greek mythological creatures of the Minotaur,                   Bacchus, Pan, and satyrs denote decadence and excess. </p>                <p>In addition, primordial bulls decorated perfume bottles and                   prehistoric caves in Southern France and Spain, representing                   the earliest known artwork to man. Several of these discoveries                   occurred while he resided in Paris.[39] For Gauguin, as for                   Picasso a generation later, this horned beast must have been                   the supreme primordial symbol representing virility and masculinity.                   Figuratively, the symbol may represent bestiality, barbarism,                   crudeness, bull-headedness and raw animal instinct. The horned                   bull remained unknown in Tahiti until Europeans imported it.[40]</p>                <p>In Oceanic myth, horned animals play a principal role. Of the                   myriad models available, the most striking to consider is the                   water-buffalo, the principle domestic animal in Indonesia (Selawesi).                   The bull is a status symbol and the main sacrificial animal,                   close to man in daily life and myth. The bull personifies bravery                   and is believed to ward off evil. In Indonesia/Selawesi, bull                   horns adorn houses and also the head gear of male dancers, and                   buffalos figure prominently in art. Small-scale male and female                   sculpted figures are often crafted in pairs, with the male donning                   horns. </p>                <p>Collapsing man and beast into one potent symbol, what at first                   seemed aligned with vice may, in fact, suggest the opposite.                   Benevolent rather than menacing, the horned creature&#8217;s                   position in relation to the reclining figure implies he may                   be protecting or guarding his companion, instead of stalking                   her. Supporting this assertion is the probability that Gauguin&#8217;s                   drawing may have been mis-titled by historian Richard Field                   in 1977, when the image was left untitled by the artist. Are                   these allusions to well-known sacred and pagan symbols merely                   coincidental? Fascinated with double-meanings, the artist likely                   intended his image to be read in a variety of ways. </p>                <p>By draining allusion to narrative, the artist reduced his characters                   to symbols, in the process celebrating the notion of hybridity                   in a modern world. Arguably led to dualities from his interest                   in androgyny, Gauguin&#8217;s image portrays two extremes that                   never fuse, but instead co-exist in the same reality. Like the                   subjects portrayed here, who reside in close proximity without                   interacting, Gauguin&#8217;s image conveys his feelings on colonizer                   and colonized &#8211; two cultures linked but separate, existing                   side-by-side in French Polynesia without opposition &#8211;                   a highly personalized message that harmony depends on careful                   balance, and a strong dose of tolerance </p>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                <p>1.

Gauguin may have used the pose to allude to                   both male and female precedents, blurring the line further between                   the sacred and profane.

Brettell, 398, reports that Leclercq labeled the painting                   &#8220;Black Olympia&#8221; when it was exhibited in Paris in                   1898.</p>                <p> 30.

Strindberg&#8217;s letter, along                   with Gauguin&#8217;s response, was reproduced in the exhibition                   catalogue of the Gauguin sale held at the H&ocirc;tel Drouot                   on Feb. 18, 1895 in Paris.</p>                <p> 34. The pose of Gauguin&#8217;s figure, while not as stiffened                   as in Puvis&#8217; early Renaissance style, remains intentionally                   awkward, recalling Manet&#8217;s depiction of Morisot in Repos.</p>                <p> 35.

Her categorization of a photo in                   Noa Noa as &#8220;Gauguin&#8217;s feminized allegory of modern                   Tahiti&#8221; inspired my ideas regarding his use of allegory.</p>                <p> 37.
