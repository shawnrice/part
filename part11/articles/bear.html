For the time may arrive, when, having                   lost the thread of control through our laxity, any attempt at                   amendment may be found to be too late for its object.&#8221;[2]                   Indeed, the desire to hold tightly to this thread dominated                   the social and political discourse of an epoch in which new                   modes of control were sought to manage an increasingly volatile                   amalgam of marginal urban groups. This project, expressed most                   definitively by Michel Foucault in his Discipline and Punish,                   consisted of &#8220;methods for administering the accumulation                   of men [which] made possible a political take-off in relation                   to the traditional, ritual, costly, violent forms of power,                   which soon fell into disuse and were superseded by a subtle,                   calculated technology of subjection.&#8221;[3] Some of the most                   engaging recent work on the history of photography in this era                   has identified the participation of the medium in the implementation                   of these technologies of power.[4] Yet, what has been effaced                   in this appealing dominant account is the story of photography&#8217;s                   incompatibility with this reconfiguration of power, of the ways                   in which the epistemological regimes attached to photographic                   practice failed as an adjunct to political desire. While the                   photographic archive developed by Alphonse Bertillon for the                   Paris police has been identified as the apotheosis of photography&#8217;s                   partnership with the investigative and surveillance prerogatives                   of the state, another mode of such observation has gone almost                   entirely unnoticed. </p>                <p class="second">Beginning in the 1870s, the use of police artists                   became a staple in the investigative repertoire of most metropolitan                   police departments in Europe and in North America.[5] (Fig.                   1). This technique operated within the context of a very different                   set of beliefs about the image and its relationship to the &#8220;improved                   administration&#8221; of the most dangerous among the many groups                   of concern to the state: the criminal. By examining the emergence                   of this alternative approach, we will be able to restore a central                   way in which the photograph was seen, in the nineteenth century,                   to be a far more problematical incarnation of the objectives                   of social control than prevailing critical notions suggest.                   The association of photography with empiricist methods of observation                   was, as I shall describe, often at odds with the larger social                   project in whose service photography was to be deployed. The                   presumption of the transparency of the medium was, in the arsenal                   of an increasingly intrusive state apparatus, a double-edged                   sword: while its unmediated status could be made to secure the                   evidentiary demands of power, the newly vital articulation of                   particularity invested in the photograph often precluded an                   appropriately expansive project of surveillance. In order to                   conduct our investigation, we need to locate these moments of                   ambivalence within an intellectual framework that underlies                   the very process of observation upon which this entire enterprise                   was predicated, namely, the perceptual. </p>                <p class="second">The panoply of scientific and juridical contexts                   within which photography operated was adroitly articulated by                   one observer in 1873 when he asserted that </p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="second">Medical men take photographs of diseased organs                     and tissues, as among the best modes of comparing one disease                     with another. Archaeologists photograph ancient marbles and                     inscriptions, ancient bronzes, and coins...civil engineers                     take photographs of broken bridges and embankments, and mechanical                     engineers of broken boilers and locomotives, that they may                     have before them a permanent record of each disaster...And                     now justice steps in to claim her share in the service which                     photography renders to mankind. She asserts that when a rogue                     has become well-nigh incorrigible, it is right that the officers                     of the law should have an eye upon him, and a clue whereby                     they may know him again when he again transgresses...to obtain                     a permanent means of knowing them again.[6]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second"> Photography, accordingly, takes on the scientific                   authority already established by these emergent professionalized                   and specialized pursuits, and is declared a corresponding means                   of recording empirically observed data. It is essential to note                   in this catalogue the extent to which the utility of photography                   is located in its ability to serve as a record, but particularly                   as a record which can be employed in a comparative process of                   perceiving. The criminal alluded to in the final category above                   is subject to photographic representation by virtue of his status                   as an habitual offender, the knowledge of whose existence has                   been empirically certified and recorded photographically. This                   emphasis on recidivism in the discourse of criminal photography                   was a commonplace, and is concurrent with the development, legislation,                   and enforcement of the Habitual Criminals Act of 1869. This                   statute provided the impetus, in England, for the beginning                   of a national photographic archive to aid the country&#8217;s                   burgeoning professional police force. The comparative basis                   of these measures attests to the degree to which the specificity                   of the photographic image was deeply embedded in its conception,                   for the process of checking a known, secure image of an identifiable                   individual against its potential referent in the real world                   was the primary method of use. </p>                <p class="second">Yet, certain episodes in the history of photography&#8217;s                   engagement with these scientific enterprises betray the incompatibility                   of the presumed specificity of the medium with the larger social                   projects in which they were employed. When Francis Galton, Darwin&#8217;s                   cousin and the founder of the Eugenics movement, sought to demonstrate                   the efficacy of rationalized breeding, he turned to photography                   as a direct visual analogue for his undertaking. Galton&#8217;s                   composite portraits of the 1870s photographed several images                   of individuals&#8211;criminals, Jews, and members of other threatening                   and marginal groups&#8211;onto the same plate with a short exposure                   time, with the aim of extracting the typical physiognomic features                   common to the group.[7] Implicit in Galton&#8217;s blending                   was the belief that underlying each of these groups were certain                   facets which could only be rendered visible by removing&#8211;breeding                   out&#8211;the specificity associated with the single portraits.                   The photograph, in this project, was imagined to offer too much                   particularity for the objectives at hand, for it was only through                   aggressive intervention upon these seemingly unmediated records                   of reality that they could be made to serve a biological and                   social program whose demands were fundamentally typological.                 </p>                <p class="second">The mitigation of the particular in Galton&#8217;s                   work is fairly well-known, and his composite portrait of the                   criminal has been widely reproduced. The recipient of less attention,                   however, is another composite portrait which appeared in the                   same initial publication of Galton&#8217;s results in 1879.                   On the same page as the composites which purported to derive                   the essential criminal type were a series of the &#8220;likenesses                   of six different Roman ladies and the composite of them in the                   centre.&#8221; (Fig. 2). The rather odd feature to be noted                   here is that these are photographs of coins which depict these                   women of antiquity, and not photographs of actual women. What                   was Galton&#8217;s aim in including this array, and why was                   it juxtaposed with the criminal portraits whose support of the                   Eugenics agenda seems so much clearer? In order to grasp fully                   what is at work here, it seems essential to point out that this                   very unusual juxtaposition makes reference to a particular trope                   of nineteenth-century art theory which would have been far more                   accessible to the initial viewers of Galton&#8217;s work, and                   to consider the set of debates into which this allusion introduces                   these images. </p>                <p class="second">The women of classical antiquity blended together                   to create one central composite image would have been evocative,                   in 1879, of the activity of another, ancient, artist, the Greek                   painter Zeuxis, one of whose signal achievements was to have                   combined the features of five beautiful women to create his                   iconic portrait of Helen of Troy, as related in Pliny&#8217;s                   Natural History. This particular parable was, by the moment                   of Galton&#8217;s images, already an established site of contention,                   for it embodied ably the conviction of many theorists that the                   great artistic genius would never simply represent that which                   could be apprehended by his senses, but rather that his invention                   would derive from an expansive field of sources that reached                   beyond the visible. Among the most influential theorists of                   nineteenth century fine arts, Quatremere de Quincy, asserted,                   not uniquely, that works of art &#8220;are not the images of                   any object that can be called real, since it is formed by the                   study of the artist, and is manifested in his productions, by                   the aid of an aggregate of ideas, forms, relations, and perfections,                   that no reality could furnish united in a single being,&#8211;a                   single subject.&#8221;[8] Crucially, this operation is nearly                   invariably proposed as an action antithetical to looking since                   &#8220;whatever comes within the scope of the understanding,                   of sentiment, and of genius, does not really exist any where,                   has neither substance nor place, and is subjected to no one                   of the senses; he who finds it is unable to point out where                   he has seen the model of it.&#8221;[9] Quatremere&#8217;s unempirical                   truth, of &#8220;a verisimilitude found nowhere in nature,&#8221;                   might be said to resemble Galton&#8217;s approach in both its                   commitment to a composite notion of verity, and its rejection                   of the visual observation of a single entity as providing the                   most veridical access to this truth. That Galton would have                   reiterated photographically the project of Zeuxis indicates                   the theoretical account upon which his &#8220;breeding&#8221;                   seems predicated: that only by selectively refining the particularities                   of the observed world to a common schema can any kind of meaningful                   accuracy be achieved. </p>                <p class="second">Precisely this ability to apprehend a verisimilitude                   beyond the senses was one which had experienced a long period                   of refinement within the realm of aesthetic debate, and had                   culminated in Sir Joshua Reynolds&#8217;s assertions in his                   Discourses on Art that the artist trained in the academic tradition                   is uniquely well-situated, &#8220;his eye being enabled to distinguish                   the accidental deficiencies and deformities of things from their                   general figures, he makes out an abstract idea of their forms                   more perfect than any one original.&#8221;[10] This view had                   been anticipated by Shaftesbury who, like Reynolds, sought to                   denigrate the perceptual basis of aesthetic judgment and the                   egalitarian possibilities of subjectivity that it implied. Shaftesbury                   had asserted that &#8220;the man of breeding has an inward eye                   that distinguishes, and sees the fair and shapely apart from                   the deformed, foul, odious, and despicable.&#8221;[11] This                   claim remarkably prefigures the idiom within which Galton&#8217;s                   project would operate, conflating the cultural and the genetic                   properties not only of artistic creation, but of aesthetic taste,                   disparaging the perceptual at the expense of a form of looking                   reserved for the rather ambiguously &#8220;cultivated,&#8221;                   and socially superior, eye. The demographic and cultural chaos                   that occurred when access to the milieux of visuality was granted                   too generously was announced by an observer in 1760, the year                   of the first British exhibition: </p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="second">as every member of the [Strand Society for                     the Encouragement of Arts] was at liberty to distribute what                     number of tickets for admittance he thought fit, that which                     was intended only as a polite, entertaining and rational amusement                     for the publick, became a scene of tumult and disorder.[12]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second"> If, as one scholar has recently argued of Eighteenth-Century                   Britain, &#8220;in becoming a viewer one not only stakes a claim                   to be able to &#8216;see&#8217; the objects of cultural regard,                   one also makes a bid for entry into the domain of the visible...[as]                   a citizen in the demos of taste,&#8221;[13] the rejection of                   the perceptual as a valid route to aesthetic and cultural enfranchisement                   would have been a far more efficient strategy for organizing                   a scene of &#8220;tumult and disorder&#8221; than merely limiting                   the number of tickets for sale or increasing their asking price.                 </p>                <p class="second">The fundamental antagonism, in Galton&#8217;s                   work and in the theoretical conversation in which it is embedded,                   between a corporeally situated empiricism available to even                   the most ribald and unsavory members of the &#8220;publick,&#8221;                   and an intellectually rooted a priori process, brings us back                   directly to that group of individuals with which Galton was                   initially concerned: the criminal. The larger fabric of political                   projects at work in the late nineteenth century, in which Galton                   imagined Eugenics to be the most instrumental thread, was deeply                   invested in this opposition, and likewise found the photograph                   to be superficially satisfying, but ultimately restrictive.                   One contemporary of Galton&#8217;s asserted that</p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="second"> The weak point in criminal anthropology,                     it seems to me, is that while criminals have been weighed                     and measured, observed and described, the classes of society                     from which most of them come, but who have not been convicted                     of breaking the law, have not been observed in the same way,                     and the same scientific tests have not been applied to them...it                     seems clear that a scientific criminal anthropology which                     is to cover the whole ground must deal with the idle, the                     vagrant, the pauper, the prostitute, the drunkard, the imbecile,                     the epileptic, and the insane, as well as the criminal.[14]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second"> The focus of the empirical repertoire, of which                   the photograph was emblematic, on the particular recidivist,                   and its failure to encompass more broadly and in a preventative                   manner the dangers residing in the threatening classes, seemed                   a shortcoming precisely because it circumscribed the field of                   visual monitoring. The photograph is&#8211;in its imagined status                   as being free from artistic mediation&#8211;not well suited                   to this particular task, for it is only by a kind of combination                   of the individual views that anything like the profound truth                   of Zeuxis&#8217;s Helen is attained. The particularity invested                   in the medium inhibits Galton&#8217;s work in a way that is                   precisely indicated by the allusions which are compelled by                   his selection of experimental subjects. The typological efficacy                   of the photograph is thus paradoxically undermined by the contemporary                   belief in its unmediated ability to capture the idiosyncratic                   and the distinct. It is as a product of this historical moment                   that the police sketch emerges, an era in which the perceptual                   and political apprehension of the criminal required more than                   the mere matching of the past offender to the archive.</p>                <p class="second"> Although a far less technologically advanced                   medium than the photograph, the police sketch had a distinct                   advantage in one crucial respect: the generation of an image                   of a criminal of unknown identity expanded the subject of investigative                   image-making to encompass the entire marginal population announced                   in the anthropologist&#8217;s complaint. In a way that the photograph&#8217;s                   presumed specificity precluded, the fact that the police sketch                   could only be refined to a certain level of particularity implicated                   a far vaster range of suspects in the crime in question. All                   those who matched the general description of the sketch were                   questionable, implicitly placing under suspicion and concomitant                   surveillance an entirely new group of individuals, all of whom                   had nothing to do with the crime&#8211;all but one, of course.                   This shift in procedure, which has been poorly served by the                   voluminous bibliography of the history of surveillance photography,                   seems to me a crucial moment in the relationship of images to                   political authoritarianism. The image-aided search for an identified,                   known, and previously convicted criminal was replaced by a far                   more expansive hunt not for an individual per se, but for all                   those who satisfied typologically the account provided by the                   police sketch. Indeed, with the aid of the police sketch, the                   &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; could be rounded up with markedly                   increased justification.</p>                <p class="second"> The presumed efficacy of this kind of typological                   inquiry was unquestionably nurtured by the same climate in which                   Galton&#8217;s project flourished. Central to this milieu was                   the development of physiognomy, which had been developed by                   the Swiss Lavater in the later eighteenth century and which                   sought to demonstrate correlations between interior dispositions                   and characteristic physical manifestations. In his influential                   study, Lavater proposed physiognomy as &#8220;the Science of                   discovering the relation between the exterior and the interior&#8211;between                   the visible surface and the invisible spirit which it covers,&#8221;                   and was predicated upon the &#8220;Harmony between Moral Beauty                   and Physical Beauty.&#8221;[15] (Fig. 3). Criminals, in the                   tradition of which Lavater is an exemplar, can be identified                   by their corporeal manifestations of &#8220;criminal&#8221;                   physical traits. Like the police sketch, the typological nature                   of Galton&#8217;s study expanded the demographic of those who                   could be reasonably monitored&#8211;and thus scrutinized as                   possible criminals&#8211;and perpetuated the correlations proposed                   by Lavater. </p>                <p class="second">But what was unique about the introduction of                   the composite police sketch was the way in which it reified                   this entire typological tradition of surveillance into a set                   of practices which imposed a political will upon the perceptual                   realm. In these portraits&#8211;for that is the genre to which                   they bear the most affinities&#8211;the police artist, as an                   extension of the state apparatus of criminal investigation,                   mediates between what is seen and what is represented. The agency                   of the psychological process of representation is ceded, by                   proxy, to the skilled hand of another party: the hybrid police-artist.                   The desire to manage the unwieldy urban populace, which operated                   under the authority of physiognomy and related flights of pseudoscientific                   fancy, was inculcated into the process by which vision is translated                   into a figurative image. The surrender of this operation to                   an image-maker whose ultimate task was to render a representation                   which would grant the greatest license to the apparatus of which                   he was a part is consistent with the larger denigration of perception                   and its apprehension of the specific we noted in the Zeuxis                   metaphor. Here, the assimilation of the recollection of the                   witness to a typological template mandated the removal of the                   particular, but in a far more insidious way than in Galton&#8217;s                   project. Now, this entire enterprise was exercised upon the                   body of that witness, upon his agency in the expression of that                   which was apprehended by his sensorium: by the substitution                   of the state&#8217;s apparatus of looking for his own. </p>                <p class="second">The imposition of the political directly upon                   the perceptual, and its mediation between vision and representation,                   ultimately helped to codify and instrumentalize the unwieldy                   morass of typological theory into a kind of cognitive schema,                   invalidating observation of the individualized person to further                   an ordered system. Indeed, these schemata, and their objective                   of getting hold of the flux of experience, are central to the                   maintenance of such a system, whether perceptual or political.                   In the influential account of a central but currently somewhat                   unfashionable figure in twentieth century art theory, Ernst                   Gombrich, pictorial representation is always filtered through                   templates that are formed by cultural traditions and which act                   as &#8220;a selective screen which admits only the features                   for which schemata exist.&#8221;[16] The formation of these                   schemata is dependent upon the visual and cultural context from                   which they derive and, consequently, the departures they compel                   in representation relate specifically to the incongruities between                   these contexts and the subject of representation. In Gombrich&#8217;s                   account, then, representation is bound inextricably to the traditions                   of the artist&#8217;s historical subjecthood, as &#8220;the                   familiar will always remain the likely starting point for the                   rendering of the unfamiliar.&#8221; When Gombrich sought, in                   the concluding sections of Art and Illusion, to locate a metaphor                   for his conception of the psychology of pictorial representation,                   he found it in what will be, by now, a familiar site:</p>                <blockquote>                   <p class="second"> Police sometimes employ draftsmen to aid                     witnesses in the identification of criminals. They may draw                     any vague figure, a random schema, and let witnesses guide                     their modifications of selected features simply by saying                     &#8216;yes,&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; to various suggested                     standard alterations...this account of portrait drawing by                     remote control may well be over-tidy, but as a parable it                     may serve its purpose. It reminds us that the starting point                     of a visual record is not knowledge but a guess conditioned                     by habit and tradition.[17]</p>                </blockquote>                <p class="second"> The police sketch was thus figured as a venue                   in which the inescapability of preexisting representational                   manifestations of a political power exerted its force, for in                   such a medium, the observation of the &#8220;real&#8221; criminal                   would always be overpowered by the typological account which                   served to sustain the power of the investigative authority.                   This tool, for Gombrich, both metaphorizes the cognitive process                   which produces representation, and serves as a metonymic reminder                   of an analogous system through which the schemata of this culture&#8211;of                   &#8220;the modern police state&#8221;&#8211;are erected. </p>                <p class="second">The &#8220;starting point&#8221; and subsequent                   modification of both perceptual and representational convention                   in Gombrich&#8217;s account should remind us again of the articulation                   of painterly principles that cast a long shadow over the nineteenth                   century, Reynolds&#8217;s Discourses, in which &#8220;an artist                   becomes possessed of the idea of that central form&#8221; of                   an object, from which all subsequent representations must derive.                   Indeed, Gombrich asserted that, in the human face, &#8220;there                   is some general dominant expression of which the individual                   expressions are merely modifications.&#8221;[18] This central                   form was certainly, in the most important sense, a dominant                   one in the construction of a typological scopic regime of modernity,                   in which modification displaced innovation. In his study of                   the history of clinical medicine, The Normal and the Pathological,                   Georges Canguilhem argued that a reconceptualization of disease                   by Auguste Comte in the first half of the nineteenth century                   cast the pathological&#8211;deviation&#8211;as being &#8220;merely                   a quantitative modification of the normal state.&#8221; The                   vast realm of disturbances to which the human body was subjected                   were no longer qualitatively distinct from the normal, but simply                   a diminution or augmentation of the normal itself. &#8220;By                   stating in a general way that diseases do not change vital phenomena,&#8221;                   Canguilhem brilliantly asserts, &#8220;Comte is justified in                   stating that the cure for political crises consists in bringing                   societies back to their essential and permanent structure, and                   tolerating progress only within limits of variation of the natural                   order defined by social statics.&#8221;[19] If the model of                   vision and image-making embodied in the proliferation of the                   police sketch imposes itself by rejecting the specificity of                   perceptual experience in order to stabilize a typological organization                   of society, this development in the conception of the normal                   and deviant bodily forms a useful counterpart. To limit the                   representational possibilities of the human face by mandating,                   as this medium does, that any image must act as merely an acceptable                   deviation from a central type, is to reinstate, at the deprivation                   of aesthetic and corporeal autonomy, precisely the equilibrium                   that oppositional imagery historically sought to disrupt. </p>                <p class="second">The proliferation of this medium seems to respond                   quite specifically to the concerns of the criminal anthropologist,                   whose aims echoed those of a particularly malevolent political                   entity, for it is precisely in the service of this apparatus                   that photography seemed, by dint of its presumed transparency,                   too empirically neutral for the expansive array of practices                   in which it was enlisted. The authority conferred upon the photograph                   had become so embedded in its general epistemological conception                   that its utility in a program whose aim was far more ambitious                   than the mere control of a single individual, became dubious.                   Situated as it was, in the midst of a central nineteenth century                   debate about practices of image-making, the privileged position                   of photography in the immediate rendering of observed reality                   could easily be discredited on the basis of a comprehensive                   denigration of the perceptual, its concomitant inability to                   access anything but surface truths, and its divorcement from                   Quatremere&#8217;s &#8220;verisimilitude found nowhere in nature.&#8221;                   The police sketch, and its insinuation of the political into                   the corporeal realm, ensured the perpetuation of a desired typological                   construction of the world, a system by which the very agency                   of the citizen to see and to represent was subsumed to the state&#8217;s                   own kind of panoptic desires. In a program of surveillance in                   which photography constituted an inadequately expansive kind                   of empirical basis, an alternative political technology of the                   body emerged, and initiated a visual realm in which looking                   was always already a matter of conviction. </p>                <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>                <p class="second"><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>                <p class="second">1. &#8220;[But as the] poet, with his tablets                   in hand, seeks for what nowhere is, yet finds it [makes a lie                   seem true.]&#8221;</p>                <p class="second"> 2.
