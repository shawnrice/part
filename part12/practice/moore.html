Since               the events in Seattle in &#8217;99 exposed the dimensions of the               anti-corporate global justice movement, they have been proliferating               around the world. Now &#8220;collective&#8221; is as cool in art               as it has been in social action. </p>            <p class="second">Among the more recently arising artists&#8217; collectives               is the <a href="http://www.16beavergroup.org">16 Beaver Group</a>               (begun 1999), based in New York&#8217;s financial district. For               several years 16 Beaver has been running evenings of artists&#8217;               presentations and lectures, discussions, and dinners, and I have               been hanging out. The tone is friendly but pretty highbrow, with               big dollops of theory sauce. The group has exhibited, mostly in               Europe, as a kind of nomadic cadre of discussion-provokers. I joined               them at Mass MOCA as one of many presenters for the &#8220;Interventionists&#8221;               exhibition in &#8216;04. They are inclusive and self-consciously               collective. What makes it &#8211; them &#8211; so congenial for               me is that 16 Beaver operates as an extramural quasi-academic enterprise,               generating discourse around artistic work and fomenting a genial               sociality that may lead to further collaborations. It&#8217;s a               genuinely open-ended pseudo-academic environment, unbound by institutional               constraints and, of course, un-watered by institutional rewards.</p>            <p class="second">On the level of curation, why exhibitions have recently               been put together with 16 Beaver and other artists&#8217; groups               has not only to do with the political landscape, but also with the               popularity of Nicholas Bourriaud&#8217;s &#8220;relational aesthetics&#8221;               within the institutional art world. His instrumental set of ideas               issued broad permits for what Joseph Beuys would call &#8220;social               sculpture&#8221; in an increasingly corporatized museum environment.               Bourriaud has stood firm with the branded author, nominating Rirkrit               Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe as exemplary artists in this genre,               so a notion of social relations as aesthetic form cannot be all               that is at work in making collectives cool.</p>            <p class="second">Grant Kester&#8217;s notion of dialogical aesthetics               and Suzanne Lacy&#8217;s socially based new genre public art are               two other important recent formulations of this question. It seems,               however, that these precepts have been widely ignored. As Lucy Lippard               would put it, &#8220;too political.&#8221;</p>            <p class="second">Artists&#8217; impulse to play school has deep roots.               Beuys&#8217; relentless pedagogy and adamantly progressive position               within and against the D&uuml;sseldorf Art Academy led him to co-found               the Free International University in 1972. This was a period of               upheaval in academia. Art schools in England had been occupied by               their students only a few years before, and international exhibitions               had been shut down. In New York, the University of the Streets was               founded in the Lower East Side by neighborhood activists in 1967.               Anyone could teach there, in the building on East 7th street donated               by a wealthy Dutch industrialist. In this groundswell of autonomous               education, people taught what they knew to people who wanted to               learn it. The University of the Streets was run by Puerto Rican               nationalists. The project coincided with the noisy, difficult birth               in this country of academic departments of ethnic studies, for which               black and Latino students mobilized nationwide to agitate.</p>            <p class="second">We are a long way from this kind of fluid moment               today, a time when students felt and acted like a socially committed,               even revolutionary force. Today&#8217;s schools are factories of               minds in which teachers are service providers to student consumers.               These institutions are at once open shops and discount stores. </p>            <p class="second">In an essay in the catalogue for the above-mentioned               &#8220;Interventionists&#8221; exhibition, Nicholas Mirzoeff imagines               today&#8217;s university&#8212;corporatized, routinized and over-administered&#8212;as               a ruin. It is haunted by a &#8220;ghost&#8221; &#8211; which we               may suspect is &#8217;68-style activism. This academic ruin contains               within it a &#8220;dream image&#8221; of what could be, just as               Walter Benjamin saw the future in the obsoleted shells of the Paris               arcades. </p>            <p class="second">The exhibition Mirzoeff catalogues challenges the               academy with &#8220;anarchism, experimentation and utopia&#8221;;               anarchism has brought everyday life into the practice of the experimental               university. In his enchanting polemic, Mirzoeff invokes a university               in the &#8220;expanded field,&#8221; recalling Rosalind Krauss&#8217;               1978 essay on sculpture in the expanded field.</p>            <p class="second">While Joseph Beuys is the glamour figure in the               aesthetic assimilation of pedagogical activity, the systemic work               of conceptual artists, particularly the Art &amp; Language group,               is a more consistent model. These guys were already art teachers               in the U.K. when they brought forth an artistic practice conceived               almost wholly in academic terms. The dauntingly, even archly complex               discussions, papers and communications, the journals and polemics               all bespoke an avant-gardism looking to bunker up in the ivory tower.               Conceptualism in general was a new artistic culture assaulting an               old; in an exemplary act, the teaching artist John Latham was fired               for literally &#8220;digesting&#8221; a copy of Clement Greenberg&#8217;s               Art and Culture checked out from his college&#8217;s library. A&amp;L&#8217;s               adherents have had a strong and steady influence on theoretically-inflected               art and art historical instruction, through the subsequent published               work of members like Charles Harrison, Michael Corris and Terry               Smith.</p>            <p class="second">Artists working in the conceptual lineage of institutional               critique have set up the academy as an arena of artistic practice.               The Friesenwall 120 project, a gallery in Cologne in the 1990s which               was a joint work of Stephan Dillemuth and Josef Strau, was clearly               indebted to the example of curation as artistic practice set by               Group Material in the United States. As a working academic, Dillemuth               has continued to take the institutional fabric of art instruction               as artistic subject, producing published and web-based books: <a href="http://www.societyofcontrol.com/akademie/index.htm">Akademie</a>               (1994), and <a href="http://www.societyofcontrol.com/research/start.htm">The               Academy and the Corporate Public</a> (2002). The first book includes               a poignant letter from Andrea Fraser, a master of the genre of institutional               critique, delivered in the teeth of a difficult seminar in Frankfurt.               The class is reading Pierre Bourdieu. She confesses, &#8220;I don&#8217;t               know what to say [to the students]&#8230;. [A]rt making is a profession               of social fantasy in which producers and consumers collude in maintaining               a system of belief which supports the value of their competencies               and dispositions&#8230;Art academies are there to ennoble investments               in futures which only exist to the extent that they themselves have               brought them into being.&#8221; Here you get the clear sense of               the immanent contingency of art world structures continually open               to change. Sounds like a good outcome for a seminar. In the second               book Dillemuth enlists Hans Haacke as polemicist and includes cartoons               by Nils Norman (who has also drawn up architectural plans for a               speculative autonomous art academy).</p>            <p class="second">Beuys was charismatic, a mystic and a top money               artist. Still, his pedagogical work answered to the most utopian               of &#8216;70s agendas. He insisted upon the progressive impulse               and the co-identity of art, education and activism, expressed unequivocally               as a conjunction of creativity and democracy.</p>            <p class="second">My first direct encounter with teaching as an explicit               mode of art was at Rainer Ganahl&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ganahlmarx.com/">&#8220;Reading               Marx&#8221;</a> sessions at Apex Art in 2001. This was more a conventional               guided reading group, taking place in an art gallery. Ganahl is               bright, and knows Marxian historiography intimately. We read short               paragraphs, sufficient to set the terms for an open discussion.               While the project was interesting, and I gleaned a teaching tactic               from it&#8212;that &#8220;bite-sized&#8221; morsels of theory can               produce discussion on the spot&#8212;this was art and it did not               lead beyond the &#8220;gallery seminar.&#8221; Instead the experience               led me back to the academy as such, and I audited David Harvey&#8217;s               wonderful class in Marx&#8217;s Capital (I) at the Graduate Center.</p>            <p class="second">With the discussions at 16 Beaver under my belt,               I ran a course in the Spring of &#8217;05 at <a href="http://new-space.mahost.org/">New               SPACE</a>, a breakaway from the Brecht Forum. &#8220;Art Life&#8221;               was a look at contemporary art history for strategies that could               lead to more imaginative political demonstrations and interventions.               Following the enrollees&#8217; lead, however, it turned into a presentation               and discussion of recent creative activist (what a Spanish commentator               calls &#8220;creactivist&#8221;) and project artwork. I presented               the work by bringing in books and showing the photos in them around               the table; for some sessions we had internet. Rarely would such               subject matter be offered in an accredited institution where students               expect to do academic work.</p>            <p class="second">While the meetings worked pretty well, they did               not transcend the fairly conventional frame -- as a &#8220;class&#8221;               with a &#8220;teacher&#8221; -- despite the sophistication of the               group and a vague collective desire to move it in some other way.               It suffered from the basic expertise-based dynamics of an art history               class. I know these things and will show you what I know. Can you               learn about some similar things and show us too (i.e., do some readings,               research and present your findings)? In this case, the answer was               no &#8211; the people were there mainly to &#8220;watch.&#8221;             </p>            <p class="second">At New SPACE I was wandering outside the precincts               of academia as I had been drilled to understand where they lie.               Despite having had to pay to prep the class and getting paid nothing               to lead it, the trip outside the walls was profoundly rewarding,               like paying to be a tourist along on a prison break.</p>            <p class="second">In the fall of &#8217;05 I was hired to teach for               a year in Georgia. This gig coincided with the &#8220;Cram Sessions:               Counter Campus&#8221; exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art,               a series of publicly baffling events organized by Chris Gilbert.               Gilbert, who has studied British A&amp;L, writes that &#8220;Counter               Campus considers how artists and artist groups have modeled environments,               tools, or self-instituted academies for autonomous and oppositional               learning.&#8221; Folks presenting and exhibiting in Baltimore included               16 Beaver, Dillemuth and Nils Norman (working together), and <a href="http://www.copenhagenfreeuniversity.dk/index.html">Copenhagen               Free University</a>. This latter group has inspired other European               faux academies, including the punky Manoa Free University and Free               Floating Faculty; another project worth noting is the London-based               University of Openess. </p>            <p class="second">Some if not all of these, it should be noted, have               links to existing academies. Their principals are academics, moving               quickly and flexibly into investigations and work that settled institutions               cannot allow. Exemplary among these is certainly the influential               Bureau d&#8217;&eacute;tudes and Universit&eacute; Tangente, bases               for the critic Brian Holmes. While he is not an academic, Holmes               has led intensive seminars for two years at 16 Beaver.</p>            <p class="second">In a chat I had with Gilbert as he was installing               Cram Sessions, he said he hoped &#8220;the show would have a capacity               to organize people.&#8221; To this end he had earlier been working               to make a radical information center, and meeting with a parallel               group outside the museum he called &#8220;the cadres.&#8221; &#8220;The               random audience won&#8217;t work,&#8221; he said. Museum walk-ins               just won&#8217;t build something that will outlast the exhibition.             </p>            <p class="second">Following this show, Gilbert moved to Berkeley to               run the University of California&#8217;s Matrix Gallery. The show               he produced there in early 2006, on the Venezuela worker&#8217;s               movement, led to his resignation and expatriation. But this is another               story (or maybe part of this one which I cannot now tell).</p>            <p class="second">Gilbert made his exhibitions explicit opportunities               of education and study and organization. This is an objective that               succeeds the idealized contemplation of isolated autonomous objects&#8212;installations,               videos, what have you&#8212;that the museum inherits from modernism               (the modernist education regimen is largely contemplation training).               Most museums and galleries are usually empty. Heated in winter and               cooled in summer, they are luxurious public spaces not put to much               public use. At Cram Sessions, visitors might wander among the &#8220;ruins&#8221;               Mirzoeff describes, holding a picnic in the cemetery. This movement               of artists forming academies augurs, as Mirzoeff writes, an &#8220;expanded               field&#8221; of use for the public spaces of art. &#8220;Academy&#8221;               is, etymologically, a grove, so it&#8217;s a kind of return to the               woods.</p>            <p class="second">This mode of exhibitionary repurposing in the U.S.               can be tracked back to the Group Material series of exhibitions               at Dia in New York in the 1990s, continued by Martha Rosler in her               democracy series there. All of this took place in the charged and               urgent moment of AIDS activism, however, where normative institutional               usages were routinely transgressed. In the U.S. this expansion of               practice seems to have snapped back into place.</p>            <p class="second">During my year of work inside an institution I adopted               &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; strategies rather than thinking how               a counter-institution might be constructed outside it. I tried to               stand outside the prescribed roles which architecture dictates,               curricula enjoin, and administrations enforce&#8212;to sneak between               the machines on the floor of the academic factory. I tried not to               over-invest in the protocols and routines of academia, but to be               nomadic, fluid, constantly in motion from one point to another,               refiguring the enterprise, trying to broaden and expand it within               the institution itself, and to inveigle others into the project&#8212;to               find partners and co-conspirators.</p>            <p class="second">What is academic entrepreneurialism? For art historians,               I think it has to do with realizing our basic community with artists,               and asking, as they do, what is this thing that I am supposed to               be doing, sharing my knowledge of art and my way of experiencing               it with others? This is academic discipline as a continuous de-               and re-centering. Academic entrepreneurialism is about other people               before it is about oneself. And that is the really hard part &#8211;               to find people who are open, who share this special delusion. With               them perhaps one reconstitute a simulacrum of the caf&eacute; environment               or the circle as it functioned in the modernist city, on vanished               dream terrain. </p>            <p class="second">As regards the theme of this PART&#8212;I don&#8217;t               believe that this kind of work now is &#8220;inefficacious.&#8221;               Or, if it is, I esteem it. Art&#8217;s business after all is affect               not effect. Even if the meaning is in the use, useless is not meaningless.               I think the key to sustaining meaningful generalizable extra-institutional               artistic work today is, as it has probably always been, to keep               one&#8217;s eye on the ball and make the political trajectory of               the work explicit. I desire autonomous institutions that make inquiries               into the prospective bases for a new society. As historians and               servants of art, it is our job to enlarge the public role for artists.               This will better their position in society, enabling their visions               to be articulated autonomously and in service of social ideals rather               than channelled into the commodity. That this objective may seem               impossible makes it all the more necessary to pursue it. After all,               it&#8217;s academic.</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Additional links:</strong></p>            <p class="second"><a href="http://slash.autonomedia.org">Interactivist               Info Exchange</a></p>            <p class="second"><a href="http://www.metamute.org/?q=en/node/7834%20">Metamute               website&#8217;s exchange of texts concerning Chris Gilbert&#8217;s               resignation following his &#8220;Now-Time Venezuela&#8221; exhibition               at the U.C.
