Since its inception in 2003, the blog has lambasted,               in its uniquely vitriolic manner, the ongoing, cumulative misdeeds               of the Bush administration and their mediation via the mainstream               American press. In what follows, Blicero and Speakingcorpse reflect               on their curiously-named project at the crossroads of art, journalism,               politics, and digital culture. Our discussion already reads like               a product of its specific, bygone moment; some of the then-immediate               issues now rendered ancient history in light of the recent elections.               AmCop&#8217;s vitriolic critique of the American free press, however,               still applies to our present and future. </p>            <p class="second">PART: I would start by asking about the origins               of the blog, what inspired you to start it, and how you transitioned               from Lee Book of Charm [now offline], your previous website, which               was a literary magazine of sorts.</p>            <p class="second">Blicero: I really just wanted to do something nice               for my parents. Turn it off. Turn the machine off.<br>              You don&#8217;t have to trace it back to LBoC necessarily. With               LBoC, I think we had a really great design because [Josh] Riesner               was doing the design, and I had a lot of images I collected from               Victorian manuals for holding parties and home entertainments, and               a lot of illustrations for that&#8230; It had a really good aesthetic               for a literary web zine, but not enough appeal to draw material               from other people. </p>            <p class="second">Speakingcorpse: During the 2000 elections, and in               the years afterwards, we had these &#8220;email nets.&#8221; We               would have conversations about political issues between five or               six people, writing back and forth to each other. It was a period               in which I was reading some blogs, particularly <a href="http://www.dynamicdems.com/mediawhores.htm">Media               Whores</a>&#8212;the best blog-style site ever&#8212;and then I               started following the links there and reading some of the other               blogs. Blicero also started reading them, and started saying he               was going to start a blog.</p>            <p class="second">B: The main periods of email activity were 9/11.               A big email chain started after that.</p>            <p class="second">S: And it started before that, with the 2000 elections.               And then it started again, with new vigor, after 9/11.</p>            <p class="second">B: And then again with new vigor in the fall of               2002, in those mid-term elections. At that time <a href="http://moveon.org/">MoveOn</a>               was sending out email &#8220;action alerts&#8221; every day, and               I was forwarding them to everyone, and that was the first time that               everyone had a sense of needing urgently to&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">S: One of the participants in the old email nets,               [AmCop&#8217;s third co-blogger] Dawkins&#8217; friend Sam Grossman,               supported the Iraq War, and there were long debates&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">B: There were several stages, several twists to               the downward spiral that resulted in the kind of situation that               necessitated the monumental expulsion that AmCop was meant to be,               and the first was the massive fraud and disappointment of the 2002               elections. Then the buildup to the war, and then the beginning of               the war, and the aftermath of the war, and by the middle of 2003               there was just the sense that our country had become so completely               paralyzed beneath&#8230; what would you call it&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">S: &#8230;A frozen layer of shit, sprayed across               the country, from the television?</p>            <p class="second">PART: If there&#8217;s a theoretical basis to the               blog, it seems to be this notion of the absurd embodied by this               word &#8220;coprophagia,&#8221; [literally, &#8220;shit-eating&#8221;].               It seems to be a way of either articulating, or responding to, or               repelling the stream of distortions and lies perpetually emerging               from the government via the mass media, which we can trace back               to the 2000 elections and the lack of media criticism of the Florida               debacle. Did the email conversations first take up this kind of               rhetoric&#8212;a grotesquely sardonic tone, satire of ordinary news               coverage dripping with rage&#8212;that has been fairly consistent               in AmCop since its origin?</p>            <p class="second">B: I don&#8217;t know when the rhetoric first began               in the emails, but probably in the move from email circuit to blog,               there was probably some major shift from &#8220;action alert&#8221;               type, &#8220;hey, get informed about this, get involved,&#8221;               to what I call &#8220;expulsions,&#8221; or urgent and frenzied,               deadpan, furious articulations of something&#8230; And it&#8217;s               important that that not be sent out to people on an email list.               The blog is the right medium for that because it&#8217;s something               that can be written in a vacuum, immediately posted, and left there,               to just emanate its&#8230; its&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">PART: Odor?</p>            <p class="second">B: Right.</p>            <p class="second">S: You don&#8217;t have to see it. If you like it               you can visit the blog.</p>            <p class="second">B: Come and eat at the table if you want to&#8230;               and so that enabled us to be that much more expressive, and violent&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">S: I remember you saying that was why we have to               have a blog. I remember writing a post about a person who I called               &#8220;Asshole Schwarzenfucker,&#8221; that was actually written               as an email first.</p>            <p class="second">B: That was our first post.</p>            <p class="second">S: I remember you had the idea for the blog, and               you were like, &#8220;we can do things whenever we want to,&#8221;               that it could be a niche in the blogosphere&#8230;<br>              <br>              PART: What is your relationship to the blogosphere in general? What               you guys are doing does seem to be in its own niche. I&#8217;m not               really aware of any other blogs that process outrage over constantly               worsening political situations and outright lies by the mass media               into this particular brand of farce. Do you see yourselves as actually               participating in the blogosphere, or sending it up? </p>            <p class="second">S: Can I say something about that?</p>            <p class="second">B: No. </p>            <p class="second">S: I think that one of the big problems with blogs               is that they often take themselves too seriously, and that even               the ones which don&#8217;t have this horrible aura of futility about               these discussions [of political events] when everything that&#8217;s               happening is so obvious. You need to believe, I guess, that having               a discussion about it matters at some level, but I always like to               think that the whole point of AmCop is that it has no political               or intellectual purpose. It&#8217;s just simple, infantile expressions               of anger, and also infantile modes of expression that are recursive,               repetitive and pointless, and can get nowhere.</p>            <p class="second">B: I would disagree with that assessment. I understand               that a lot of the posts are informed by that spirit, but there have               in fact been a lot of eloquent and articulate things that have been               said.</p>            <p class="second">S: That&#8217;s true. </p>            <p class="second">B: Maybe you end up saying something that has a               kind of value, but that value is different from being accurate,               or timely, or insightful, in the manner of what these other blogs               are doing. And I read those blogs, and they&#8217;re great, but               the sense of futility comes from the fact that all of this truth               that these bloggers are posting, hour after hour, day after day,               exposing lie upon lie, layer upon layer of these scandals&#8212;it               all goes down the memory hole, it&#8217;s completely swallowed in               this amnesia vacuum that we live in, and a week from now no one               remembers any of it. One of the earliest features of AmCop was called               the &#8220;Annular Flashback,&#8221; and it looked back at some               exchange from the email list from the year before. It was a play               on words, referring both to &#8220;annual&#8221; and to David Foster               Wallace&#8217;s concept of &#8220;annular fusion,&#8221; a fictional               process of energy production whereby waste feeds off the by-products               of its own creation&#8212;waste feeding off waste to become more               powerful and more poisonous.</p>            <p class="second">PART: Sounds like a theory of entropy.</p>            <p class="second">B: It&#8217;s sort of the reverse of entropy&#8212;it&#8217;s               heading towards concentration&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">S: &#8230;and Apocalypse.</p>            <p class="second">B: Exactly. Just to look at some news item that               was being exchanged a year ago has almost become too horrifying.               Both to realize how sickening the item was, and to realize, what               does it mean now? It&#8217;s just one more lie that will never be               accounted for or reckoned with.</p>            <p class="second">S: It&#8217;s like thinking about Hurricane Katrina               now, three months afterwards.</p>            <p class="second">B: There are other blogs that get lumped as &#8220;humor               blogs,&#8221; such as <a href="http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/">Patriot               Boy</a>, whose blogger goes by &#8220;General J.C. Christian,&#8221;               and signs every post &#8220;Heterosexually yours.&#8221;</p>            <p class="second">S: They&#8217;re letters to various fascists, congratulating               them on their achievements and suggesting more extreme measures               they might take.</p>            <p class="second">PART: What do you make of the success of a blog               like the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">Huffington Post</a>?</p>            <p class="second">S: That&#8217;s not really a blog, it&#8217;s a               full-scale news magazine. It&#8217;s awesome. And just to clarify               one thing&#8212;I agree with Blicero, there&#8217;s lots of good               stuff on our blog&#8212;but I think that the spirit of not having               it matter, that you can curse, that you don&#8217;t have to do build               up a huge audience or appeal to anyone&#8212;that&#8217;s really               important. </p>            <p class="second">B: We do have a small but very intelligent audience.               If you do post something, chances are it will be responded to by               one or more of our readers. We&#8217;ve actually had some incredibly               stimulating discussions in the comment threads. But it&#8217;s also&#8230;               I recently posted a series of photographs that I took this winter               at a deserted Christian children&#8217;s camp in Western Pennsylvania,               and that got a lot of attention. So it can also be stray fragments               from daily experience that have some kind of tangential connection               to the general body of horror that is our national politics and               our national psyche. You can post these things, and they&#8217;ll               be appreciated.</p>            <p class="second">PART: Yet right now it seems like there are all               these little worlds that are being formed on the Internet, but it&#8217;s               hard to say what effectiveness they&#8217;ll have. They run the               risk of drowning each other out, in a way&#8212;there&#8217;s this               incredible wealth of information on the web.</p>            <p class="second">S: Everything is already drowned out.</p>            <p class="second">B: Just in the lefty blogosphere, there are so many               blogs, 90% of which are saying pretty much the same thing from day               to day, which is why in this sea of voices, we hope to be somewhat               unique. One thing that&#8217;s been pretty dehumanizing in the last               couple years is to see how people, just because they have power,               can use language as a blunt instrument, a bludgeon. The blogosphere               has realized that the way to combat that is by deploying language               in a very methodical, very disciplined way. Marshal your facts,               marshal your messages, and march forward day after day saying something               different. That is probably the way forward for the political movements               on the left. But for us, who are trying to do that, we also want               some way of responding to the bludgeoning directly. We want a way               to lash out with what we feel like is the same violence. And of               course it doesn&#8217;t have any effect; it&#8217;s a lashing out               into the void.</p>            <p class="second">S: Violence never has any effect. That&#8217;s the               paradox of violence. And our blog is violent. That&#8217;s one of               the things I want to get at.</p>            <p class="second">PART: In my work on art of the 1960s, it seems like               there was a general sense among a lot of the New Left, particularly               in relation to the Vietnam War, that language had reached this limit,               that the project of trying to talk things out or explain things               had somehow become exhausted. You see this as a theme with a lot               of the radical movements, both artistic and social, that appeared               at the end of that decade. I&#8217;m always trying to compare that               period and now, in particular our notably diminished political response               in comparison with that of the 1960s. </p>            <p class="second">S: I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the case               that language has been exhausted. But right now, what&#8217;s so               horrible is just this debasing, this killing of language [by neoconservatives               and the media]. And this is powerful, because it takes away your               power to respond to your interlocutors, and deprives you of language.               It doesn&#8217;t mean that language as such is exhausted, but it               creates a situation in which there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much               of a point in speaking.</p>            <p class="second">B: The media abets the appearance that language               is exhausted by seeming to acknowledge and respect what those in               power declare as the limits of language&#8212;as it&#8217;s normally               called, the &#8220;terms of the debate.&#8221; Once the terms of               the debate become reified by the mass media, it really does seem               that there&#8217;s nothing to say outside these bounds.</p>            <p class="second">S: But in no sense is language exhausted. The language               used on our blog is language&#8212;it&#8217;s interesting, it&#8217;s               fun. The point is this horrible disconnect between normal, healthy,               human uses of language, which still flourish, and the entire public               realm, which exists in a state of utter debasement and stupidity.               There&#8217;s no place for actual language in the public realm.</p>            <p class="second"> PART: This idea of shit, this irredeemable substance,               completely base, a substance that can no longer be recycled&#8230;</p>            <p class="second">B: Oh, but it can be recycled. That&#8217;s something               we constantly point out: the endless recycleability of shit. And               it&#8217;s a peculiarly fecund substance. </p>            <p class="second">S: Do you really want to say that these words act               as fertilizer?</p>            <p class="second">B: Yes I do. Say there&#8217;s a period that&#8217;s               just so depressing that you don&#8217;t even feel like posting anything.               And then something happens that&#8217;s so outrageous and so preposterous               in just the right way that you&#8217;re moved to just go on a full-out               rant using shit as its theme, instrument, substance and agenda.               As Speakingcorpse points out, that particular shit-based rant, which               I wrote recently when Jean Schmidt, or Jean Shit, expelled her shit               on the floor of the House about Representative Murtha, I had to               respond to her use of shit, which she had used as a weapon against               me, it&#8217;s a way of returning to the origin&#8212;</p>            <p class="second">S: The primal scene&#8212;</p>            <p class="second">B: The primal scene of AmCop, to return to a place               where you can return to that original flow of outraged language.</p>            <p class="second">S: The primal scene is also a scene of impotence               and terror, because you are sitting there looking at a piece of               shit. Someone has said something, and they&#8217;ve left the scene,               and you&#8217;re looking at not words, but just a pile of shit.             </p>            <p class="second">B: In the case of Jean Shit, she wasn&#8217;t there               to leave. She is made of shit. And since the only thing that can               come from her is shit, she&#8217;s expelling shit onto her listeners,               asking that they consume the shit, regurgitate it, so that she can               then reingest it, drawing power to herself, and then expel it back               out again. Producing your own shit is a way of refusing to participate               in this feedback loop. </p>            <p class="second">S: But what do you say to shit?</p>            <p class="second">B: This is a question that we often come back to.</p>            <p class="second">S: The part of me that enjoys the blog is also a               part of myself that I don&#8217;t like. I can respond best when               I&#8217;m hit and I suddenly feel a flash of blind fury, which,               however justified, is not totally inspired by what&#8217;s going               on. Clearly there&#8217;s a reservoir of rage that has other sources               and motivations that is occasioned by these scandals. For me there               was a consistent source of content when I was producing a series               of letters to David Brooks [the conservative New York Times columnist].</p>            <p class="second"> B: The &#8220;Dear Dirty Asshole&#8221; posts.</p>            <p class="second">S: I conceive of the primal scene as the situation               of: okay, there&#8217;s shit in front of me. Obviously I shouldn&#8217;t               acknowledge it, or attempt to talk to it. I should step away from               it, and try to do something else, something creative, or positive,               something that doesn&#8217;t involve shit. But instead I insist               on responding to the shit, because I insist on taking seriously               the premise that it&#8217;s an utterance and not shit, which leads               to feelings of rage, because, how can you talk to shit? And then               the rage is turned inward, and it becomes poisonous and cancerous,               and there&#8217;s this metastasizing that feeds and feeds upon itself,               and is impotent&#8212;which doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that               it&#8217;s not creative.</p>            </td>        </tr>      </table>           </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
