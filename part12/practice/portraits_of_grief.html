We did this by examining the way photographs               are remembered and/or misremembered, as well as the way in which               they are able or unable to account for actual atrocities.</p>            <p align="left" class="second"> The exhibition was divided into two               parts. The first section displayed a series of printed questionnaires               that had been presented to individuals in the blocks in the immediate               vicinity of The Graduate Center. The questionnaire asked whether               the participant remembered the Abu Ghraib torture images and if               so, could they describe them. In the questionnaires, the respondents               displayed a wide demographic range and showed a similarly wide range               of reactions to the images. Several of the people interviewed stated               that they did not know the images at all. Some were outraged by               them, while some shared no reaction. The second section of the exhibition               addressed a particular atrocity resulting from the invasion of Iraq               by the United States, by recreating the &#8220;Portraits of Grief&#8221;               series produced by the <em>New York Times</em> after September 11,               2001. These new &#8220;portraits&#8221; were of Iraqi civilians               who had been killed as a consequence of American military action               in Iraq. The information used in the texts, including some of the               photographs, was primarily gathered from websites and other sources               accounting for civilian deaths throughout Iraq. As the &#8220;portraits&#8221;               were intended to be part of a critical art project, borrowing from               the rhetorical forms of the <em>New York Times</em> obituary as               well as that of the photograph, the writers decided that biographical               details could be invented and images borrowed when necessary to               aid the project&#8217;s intention. Where the first section was displayed               as a continuous stream of questionnaires, the second section displayed               one portrait per cabinet, enlarged to poster size. In addition,               quotes by authors Roland Barthes and Susan Sontag critically addressing               the issue of atrocity were hung in a continuous banner across the               lower section of the cabinets. These quotations helped to visually               and thematically link the two parts of the exhibition: one that               reflected a more academic study attuned to its scholarly setting,               the other a critical commentary on the tragedy of loss in an atrocity               in which every viewer was made complicit. </p>            <p align="left" class="second">Text by Karen Hellman</p>            <p align="left" class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/header.jpg" width="360" height="56"></p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/uday.jpg" width="360" height="514"></p>            <p align="center" class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/ali.jpg" width="360" height="503"></p>            <p align="center" class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/khalid.jpg" width="360" height="514"></p>            <p align="center" class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/rowand.jpg" width="360" height="477"></p>            <p align="center" class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/ali&#32;izmerly.jpg" width="360" height="433">             </p>            </td>        </tr>      </table>           </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
