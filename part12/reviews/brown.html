The goal               of questioning the usefulness of a term encompassing artists of               varying nationalities, geographic regions, and even religions was               announced at the outset in the introductory wall text. The &#8220;core&#8221;               group of artists, as the introduction referred to them, comprised               artists from the Islamic world who now live and produce work elsewhere.               Many of these artists, such as Shirin Neshat and Mona Hatoum, are               regular fixtures on the ever-growing circuit of mammoth international               exhibitions. Additionally, the question of what constitutes Islamic               art was complicated by the inclusion of two non-Muslim American               artists, Bill Viola and Mike Kelley, whose included works reference               Islamic spirituality and traditional art forms, respectively. The               exhibition was admirable in its stated attempt to analyze the usefulness               of a general rubric often used in recent discourse but perhaps insufficiently               questioned. Whether this goal worked on the level of actual curatorial               practice, however, is another matter. </p>            <p class="second">As outlined in the exhibition brochure and catalogue,               the artists in the exhibition were grouped into four main categories               designated by the curator: &#8216;Text Versus Calligraphy,&#8217;               &#8216;Beyond Miniature Painting,&#8217; &#8216;Looking under the               Carpet,&#8217; &#8216;Identity in Question,&#8217; and &#8216;On               Spirituality.&#8217; No wall graphics, however, informed the viewer               of these groupings. It was only through by the accompanying brochure               that one could become aware of the subcategories upon which the               arrangement of works was based.</p>            <p class="second">Hung on its own wall, the first work that the viewer               encountered was Shirazeh Houshiary&#8217;s <em>Fine Frenzy</em>               (2004) which draws upon an Arabic calligraphic tradition but translates               it into a contemporary, universal idiom with no visible evidence               of the Arabic text with which the image is created. Houshiary built               up layers of text in white pencil and then selectively erased the               markings to produce an abstract image that appears to simultaneously               emerge and dissolve. The work&#8217;s prominent position at the               entrance to the show emphasized that while the selection criteria               for the artists in the show was primarily &#8216;identity&#8217;               based, one of the main lenses used for viewing the work was formal.               While Daftari placed the work within the context of text and calligraphic               traditions, it also fit with the exhibition&#8217;s emphasis on               a sense of spirituality unbound to direct references to the tenets               of Islam. Furthermore, the prominence given to Houshiary&#8217;s               formally beautiful and spiritually evocative abstraction also proclaimed               the show&#8217;s avoidance of anything politically controversial.</p>            <p class="second">The majority of <em>Without Boundary</em> was devoted               to examining the ways that contemporary artists re-engage with,               re-invent, and subvert traditional Islamic art practices. The section               on carpets provided several salient examples of the difficulty of               using the term &#8216;Islamic&#8217; for contemporary artists. Mona               Hatoum&#8217;s 1995 <em>Prayer Mat</em> made of needles references               the Islamic prayer mats that must be oriented towards Mecca (Hatoum               herself is in fact not Muslim but a Christian born in Lebanon and               currently residing in Europe). A similar prayer mat piece by Hatoum               was concurrently installed with the permanent collection of contemporary               works on the second floor, where it is viewed not in terms of identity               politics but post-minimalist aesthetics. Further complicating the               question &#8220;Islamic or not&#8221; was a contemporary rug made               in Iran, which of all the works in the show most closely resembled               a traditional Islamic work of art. The rug, however, was designed               by American artist Mike Kelley following a reproduction of an Ottoman               carpet in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Kelley               replaced the red background with green, however, to evoke his Irish               heritage, and also substituted the central medallion for a Pennsylvania               Dutch hex sign. </p>            <p class="second">In works belonging to the category &#8216;Identity               in Question,&#8217; most treated identity in terms of gender, ethnicity,               or religion, as in Jananne Al-Ani&#8217;s photographs of herself,               her mother, and her sisters in various states of adorning veils.               On the other hand, the Atlas Group/Walid Raad&#8217;s neo-conceptual               <em>Civilizationally, We Do Not Dig Holes To Bury Ourselves</em>               (2002) tackles the identity question in a more universal fashion               in terms of true/false identities and fictional personas. The Atlas               Group itself is actually a fictional collective consisting solely               of Raad. In the work on view, photographs from the 1950&#8217;s               purportedly document Dr. Fakhouri, a Lebanese historian who gave               documents to the Atlas Group, in front of various European monuments.               Fakhouri, however, is a fictional character created by Raad, and               the man in the photographs is most likely his father.[1]</p>            <p class="second">Unfortunately, one of the strongest works from the               &#8220;On Spirituality&#8221; section was not in the main exhibition               space but a little out-of-the-way gallery on the second floor. Those               who noticed the small signage indicating that the show continues               and find their way downstairs were rewarded with Istanbul-born Kutlug               Ataman&#8217;s <em>99 Names</em>, a 2002 video installation, which               the artist describes as recording his visceral response to the terrorist               attacks of September 11, 2001. Five separate video screens show               the artist in various states of a self-induced trance that mounts               in intensity across the five monitors. The video panels were suspended               from the ceiling at various angles and staggered in height and distance,               so that the work functioned both as a video to be watched and as               a sculpture that must be engaged by moving through the space.</p>            <p class="second">In mounting an exhibition that highlights artists               working in a contemporary idiom born outside traditional European/North               American centers and placing them on equal footing with their American               colleagues, the MoMA showed that it had made significant strides               since its widely criticized exhibition, <em>Primitivism in Modern               Art</em> of 1984, which set up affinities between &#8220;primitive&#8221;               and modern art but completely ignored the development of modernism               within the countries designated as primitive. Focusing on artists               born in former colonial and/or post-colonial countries, areas of               the world either previously ignored by Art History or treated as               a marginal, exotic &#8216;other,&#8217; <em>Without Boundary</em>               presented a curatorial model heavily influenced by postcolonial               theory. Indeed, the inclusion in the catalogue of an essay by postcolonial               theorist Homi Bhabha made the connection with this methodology explicit.</p>            <p class="second">With an introductory wall text proclaiming that               it approaches the included artists with an emphasis on individual               rather than collective identity, <em>Without Boundary</em> also               engaged with a recent curatorial interest in a &#8216;post-identity&#8217;               theoretical model. Uptown at the Studio Museum, Harlem, Thelma Golden&#8217;s               group show of African American-artists, <em>Frequency</em>, closed               just before the opening of <em>Without Boundary</em> at the MoMA.               The show was a follow-up to the influential 2001 exhibition <em>Freestyle</em>,               which promoted the term &#8216;post-black.&#8217; This time around,               <em>Frequency</em>&#8217;s wall text declared its selection criteria               to be artists who challenge the label of &#8216;black artist,&#8217;               &#8220;preferring to be understood as individuals with complex investigations               of blackness in their work.&#8221; Precedents of this type of show               also include the 2000 exhibition <em>Ultrabaroque: Aspects of Post-Latin               American Art</em> organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, San               Diego, whose inclusion of the term &#8220;Post-Latin American&#8221;               in its title signified a desire to move beyond readings of Latin               American art based solely on assertions of national identity.</p>            <p class="second">Walking through <em>Without Boundary</em>, one could               not help noticing that the show seemed to avoid any artwork that               could be construed as politically controversial, despite the fact               that the recent history of the Islamic world has been marked by               political struggles and violence. The work in the show that most               directly engaged with recent history is Iranian-born Shirin Neshat&#8217;s               photograph with ink, <em>Speechless</em>, of 1996: a woman with               a gun barrel in place of an earring, with a poem celebrating martyrdom               by the contemporary poet Tahereh Saffarzedeh inscribed on its surface               by Neshat. The accompanying wall text, however, served to soften               the effect of the work, summarizing it as &#8220;noting the social               class newly empowered by the revolution.&#8221; Certainly not every               artist from the Islamic world is or should be concerned with political               issues in his or her artistic practice. Yet in light of curatorial               choices at play in the MoMA&#8217;s exhibition, it is hard not to               wonder if certain decisions were made more to avoid controversy               than to give an accurate view of an artist&#8217;s body of work.               Emily Jacir is best known for work that deals with the way Israeli               checkpoints and border crossing restrictions affect the lives of               both Palestinians and Israelis. At the 2004 Whitney Biennial, some               angry visitors asked for their money back in response to Jacir&#8217;s               work that documented herself using the privileges of her American               passport to carry out the wishes of Palestinians around the world               who have limited or no access to their homeland. There is no such               risk of angry viewers of Jacir&#8217;s piece in <em>Without Boundary</em>,               a two-channel video installation that shows the similarities between               comparable businesses in New York and Ramallah. While the majority               of The Atlas Group/Walid Raad&#8217;s oeuvre concerns itself with               the way violence has shaped the recent history of Lebanon, his work               in <em>Without Boundary</em>, though fascinating, was a bit anodyne               compared to the piece in the MoMA&#8217;s own collection documenting               Beirut car bombings or, for that matter, much of the work on view               in the Walid Raad/Atlas Group exhibition concurrently on view at               the Kitchen in Chelsea. </p>            <p class="second">The inclusion of American artists in <em>Without               Boundary</em> was commendable for its attempt to complicate the               question of what constitutes &#8216;Islamic&#8217; art. The show,               however, presented a rather uneven balance between artists from               Islamic countries and Western artists, making the inclusion of the               two Americans seem like an afterthought or a superficial gesture.               One cannot help but wonder if the exhibition was originally subtitled               <em>Fifteen Ways</em> instead of <em>Seventeen Ways</em>, and whether               at the last minute the two Americans were added to make the show               seem less narrow in its examination. It also seems strange that               these two additional artists were both American, given the international               breadth of the exhibition as a whole. Surely this cannot be because               only American artists are influenced by Islamic art, as Italian               Francesco Clemente&#8217;s paintings in the style of Persian miniatures               would have fit just as well in the exhibition. </p>            <p class="second">While Without Boundaries tried to question the usefulness               of the term &#8216;Islamic,&#8217; it is only through reading the               curatorial texts that the questioning became clear. On the actual               level of simply looking at the works in the show and the way they               were organized, one remained unaware of the exhibition&#8217;s goal.               Even with the cursory inclusion of the two Americans, the exhibition               read as one of many identity-based shows that have appeared in the               last twenty years. In the end, the strength of the show lay not               in its overall curatorial conception and ambition but in the quality               of many of the individual works on view. Furthermore, with many               artists in the show enjoying major art-star status, the more pertinent               question may be not how useful the term &#8216;Islamic&#8217; is,               so much as the use-value of exhibitions that use identity or origin               as selection criteria in an increasingly decentralized, global art               world. Certainly religious and ethnic identities are still worth               examining, but on the level of curatorial practice as opposed to               rhetoric, <em>Without Boundary</em> did not succeed in its attempt               to offer a viable, non-essentialist alternative to the old identity-politics               formula.</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Amanda H.
