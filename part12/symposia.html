Topics               include, but are not limited to: natural or accidental destruction;               economically and politically motivated destruction; vandalism as               ritual; iconoclasm; censorship; over-painting and the methods for               its reversal; the appropriation and confiscation of art; interventions               in built and natural environments; graffiti art, tagging, and street               art; destruction as a form of creation; and the relationship of               conservation, preservation, and restoration to defacement.

We are not interested in the               truth or falsity of this conceit, but how it operates as an interpretive               paradigm. In several key episodes of Latin American art, artists               and critics have positioned the region as a privileged, even mythological,               site for the final realization of an avant-garde project initiated               in Europe. In other instances, avant-gardism provided a discourse               of rupture by which Latin American artists aligned themselves with               revolutionary, utopian, and universalist aims while disavowing European               cultural dependency and advancing a claim for the unique character               of the national or regional avant-garde. In both cases, the original               military metaphor of the avant-garde, with its associations of innovation,               radicality, and novelty, has been brought to bear on artistic movements               and individual experiments that have self-consciously figured &quot;lastness&quot;               as a strategic paradigm.</p>            <p>The conjoining of these two impulses within the Latin American               avant-garde forces into view key structural contradictions between               modernity, Modernism, and the avant-garde. How is characterization               of the Latin American avant-garde as either unitary or merely reactive               complicated by the avant-garde's fundamentally international character?               How has avant-gardism intersected with political, economic and military               pressures particular to the region? How have Latin American artists               engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations and expanded networks               of informational flow in order to catalyze new, or &quot;final&quot;               articulations of the avant-garde? How have artists exploited temporal               delay and geographic marginality as aesthetic and conceptual gambits,               and how might such articulations debunk the very notion of the avant-garde's               originality?</p>            <p> In recent years, Latin American modern art has reemerged as a               priority within academic departments and museum collections, an               interest that coincides with a shift away from regionalism and identity               politics as the central tropes of its study. In this sense too,               Latin American art can be considered the &quot;last,&quot; or most               recent, avant-garde to be canonized (or colonized) within art historical               Modernism. How can new studies and interpretations of Latin American               avant-garde art allow us to refigure histories of &quot;prewar&quot;               and &quot;postwar&quot; art, modernity and cultural exchange, theories               of the avant-garde and neo-avant-garde, and other modernist methodologies?               How might recent theoretical models posited in exhibitions such               as Inverted Utopias and The Geometry of Hope such as the &quot;constellation,&quot;               &quot;regressive utopia,&quot; or &quot;deformed modernity&quot;               impact the study of avant-gardism in Latin America? At a current               moment in which the dialectic between &quot;local&quot; and &quot;global&quot;               has taken center stage, how might art historians help shape a history               of the region that accounts for and challenges larger threads of               avant-gardism?</p>            <p>We welcome submissions for 20-minute papers that employ, problematize,               and expand concepts of the avant-garde in order to address 20th               century Latin American art and its critical reception.

From the dual modalities of             the East Asian brush arts to the site-specificity of the 1970s, from             altars to installations, from the physical consumption of medieval             manuscripts to the integration of sound into Minimalist and post-Minimalist<br>            performative practices, the history of art-in all of its periods,             cultures, and media-is rich with examples of works which problematize             a unidirectional understanding of art as an exclusively visual experience,             speaking, sometimes through idiosyncratic uses of media, to the emergence             of an embodied viewer.<br> <br>            The Symposium will provide a forum in which to critically assess the             dynamic relations and interrelations of the senses not only as they             materialize within the art work itself, but also as pertains to art             production, theory, and criticism. We intend this Symposium to reflect             as broad a geographical and chronological scope as possible; accordingly,             we invite pertinent applications from all fields and periods in the<br>            humanities and social sciences.<br> <br>            Please email your one-page abstract (300 words maximum) and CV as             an attachment to <a href="mailto:BerkeleySymposium2008@gmail.com" class="link_underline">BerkeleySymposium2008@gmail.com</a>             by January 20th.

Today, new imaging techniques and               media (such as the use of medical and satellite imaging, or studies               in film and video game theory) have expanded our understanding of               the visual. As a result, the boundaries that have traditionally               limited art historical inquiry to certain kinds of imaging practices               have undergone considerable revision. In recent years, a number               of disciplines have explored fundamental questions concerning how               scientific images operate within the realm of social and cultural               practice. This year&acirc;&euro;&#8482;s symposium seeks to address               such modes of visual production, both contemporary and historical,               which, by their very nature as processes with pictorial outcomes,               have the potential of existing within the realm of art historical               discourse.</p>            <p>In the ongoing debates, which pit the study of &quot;art history&quot;?               against, or in an adversarial relationship to visual culture, where               are the lines drawn? When and in what ways do objects transcend               the boundaries of art or science? How have artists and practitioners               used the scientific and technological advancements of their times               to blur these boundaries? Are the products of visual media today               contributing to the growth of visual intelligence about the past?</p>            <p>With our focus on frames for understanding the visual, we will               be connecting the arts with the cognitive and natural sciences,               history, anthropology, philosophy, film, and cultural and media               studies. We welcome projects that will illuminate the arts through               the exploration of interdisciplinary visual media, or that will               expand understandings of interdisciplinary visual media through               a focus on the arts. Possible topics might include: current artistic               explorations in scientific and medical imaging; the communication               of ideas and popular images using historical technologies, such               as technologies of the book, or, in contemporary societies, through               the use of the Internet; explorations of cartography and urban planning,               as well as any other discipline-specific imaging conventions not               traditionally associated with the art world that has begun to inform               contemporary art practice.</p>            <p>Featured Speaker:<br>              James Elkins is currently E.C.
