The white               owner&#8217;s foot is confidently perched upon the rear bumper of               a car as he engages in a conversation with another man barely inside               the photographer&#8217;s frame. Four black workers sit behind the               owner on the steps of a store which sells, among other things, Coca-Cola.               The lanky workmen are idle, awaiting instructions from their boss,               a stout fellow who appears to be about sixty-five years old. The               domination of the frame by the white landowner coupled with the               submissive position of the black workers (not to mention the boss/worker               relationship suggested by the photograph&#8217;s title) point to               racial and class differences, providing a hint that the legacy of               the slavery system dismantled seven decades earlier was still very               much alive in 1936 in Mississippi. </p>            <table width="628" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td width="328" valign="top"><p><img src="images/belden1.jpg" width="300" height="233"></p>                  <p><strong>Figure 1</strong>.

But in Lange&#8217;s               case, few people ever got to see the images as she intended them               to be seen.[1] After Lange composed, developed, selected and submitted               her uncropped photographs to her boss Roy Stryker at the Farm Security               Administration in Washington D.C. &#8211; about a thousand miles               away from Clarksdale &#8211; the images were altered to fit the               New Deal organization&#8217;s mission, which was &#8220;to rouse               outrage, sadness or any other emotional state aimed at changing               conditions&#8221; while making &#8220;the &#8216;forgotten&#8217;               people visible.&#8221;[2] Yet in the course of making these &#8220;forgotten&#8221;               rural Americans hit hard by the Great Depression visible, the black               plantation workers became invisible. A generously cropped version               of Lange&#8217;s original photograph was offered free of charge               to publications nationwide in order to rouse support among the East               Coast urban upper-classes for Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#8217;s               New Deal relief programs by revealing the plight of the rural poor.[3]               (Figure 3) After all, the F.S.A.&#8217;s task was not to reveal               America&#8217;s flaws and racial inequalities, but to make convincing,               photography-based, moral, humanist appeals to be targeted at people               from upper classes to promote the spirit of charity &#8211; and               of course, Roosevelt&#8217;s reform agenda.[4] In doing this, according               to Martha Rosler, the F.S.A. actually functioned to reassure viewers               of the photographs of their own elevated social positions as the               non-suffering &#8220;givers&#8221; of charity, while avoiding overtly               challenging the inequities of American society.[5] (In 1936, it               would be doubtful that white, affluent East Coasters would be interested               in helping the idle black men who sit on the porch.[6] Typically,               the F.S.A. favored generalized, iconic images which roused sympathy               but assigned no blame to either the proud victims of the misfortune               or to their oppressors).[7]</p>            <table width="612" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td width="262" valign="top"><p><img src="images/belden3.jpg" width="240" height="300"></p>                  <p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Dorothea Lange. <em>Plantation                     Overseer.

Through a discussion of several versions of Dorothea Lange&#8217;s               <em>Plantation Overseer. Mississippi Delta, Near Clarksdale, Mississippi</em>               (1936), which were edited to remove hints of Lange&#8217;s suggestion               of social inequities such as racism in America, I hope to illustrate               the degree to which Lange&#8217;s insistence upon raising the issues               of racism were seen as too &#8220;radical,&#8221; and were suppressed               in favor of towing the New Deal line to create the illusion of national               solidarity while masking issues of social division. I also wish               to suggest that the F.S.A.&#8217;s policy of allowing unsupervised               reproduction and manipulation of its photography by the media also               permitted uncontrolled reinterpretations and recontextualizations               which often changed the meaning of the original images substantially.               This policy enabled the images to take on meanings which further               obviated Lange&#8217;s original intent to document racial inequality.               A closer look at several versions of Lange&#8217;s photographs before               and after their publication will reveal the photographs&#8217; politicized               repackaging by the F.S.A. and other media.[8]</p>            <p class="second">In Lange&#8217;s photograph <em>Plantation Overseer.               Mississippi Delta, Near Clarksdale, Mississippi</em> (Figure 1),               which was introduced briefly at the start of this paper, the plantation               owner in the foreground cocks his head slightly to his left, with               his mouth slightly open. He appears to have been candidly caught               in mid-conversation with the person in the left edge of the photograph.               He seems a friendly man, the kind who talks to strangers. The expression               in the landowner&#8217;s eyes is obscured by his squint, the glint               of sun glare in the lenses of his glasses and the shadow under the               rim of his hat. He has weathered the sun and elements, as his facial               expression and wrinkled face and neck attest, with a self-assured,               proud, calm, down-to-earth dignity. His sleeves are rolled up for               the act of work. The plantation owner&#8217;s plumpness and his               very presence at the rural store (which advertises Coca-Cola, one               of the most recognizable and enduring of America&#8217;s mass-produced               products) and the presence of the automobile &#8211; a luxury good               &#8211; suggest that the plantation owner plays his part in the               American economy, and that this role has been rewarded accordingly.               This man in the foreground therefore becomes a one-man embodiment               of the &#8220;American Dream&#8221;: that hard work and fortitude               will bring good fortune to all.</p>            <p class="second">The commonly reproduced, altered version of Lange&#8217;s               photograph focuses only on the plantation owner (Figure 3), leaving               us to ponder the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; in the light of such               alterations, which imply that sometimes even good fortune can be               rattled by greater economic forces which are larger than even the               most earnest American. In spite of the fact that a man as proud               and earnest as this plantation owner -who holds his head high and               survived the previous economic depression in the late nineteenth               century - would likely never ask for help, that is precisely why               he needs it. This man is the salt of the earth, and he deserves               our help simply because sometimes tough times befall good people,               and people have to look out for each other.[9] True to form, rather               than examine the causes of the human hardship or delve into the               reasons why the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; might have failed during               the Great Depression, the alterations made to this F.S.A. photograph               shifts the image&#8217;s meaning instead to humanitarianism, illustrating               &#8220;what happened when we turned our backs on fellow citizens               and allowed them to be ravaged,&#8221; and simultaneously appealing               to affluent Americans to support Roosevelt&#8217;s efforts to help               the less fortunate.[10] In Roosevelt&#8217;s own words, &#8220;social               change was difficult if not impossible &#8216;in our civilization               unless you have sentiment.&#8217;&#8221;[11] F.S.A. photography               such as Lange&#8217;s rouses this sentiment through appealing to               the moral goodness of affluent urban viewers to help their fellow               man. The photographs did so by capturing &#8220;not only what a               place or a thing or a person looks like, but it must also tell the               audience what it would <em>feel</em> like to be an actual witness               to the scene.&#8221;[12] Lange became a stand-in for the viewer,               a surrogate who allowed the viewer of published images to feel like               he or she was participating in the moment. Yet by showing the viewers               a vision of a social class and region of the country that was very               different from their own, the images also kept the viewer from truly               stepping into the other person&#8217;s shoes &#8211; and this in               fact affirmed the subject&#8217;s position as the much less fortunate               &#8220;other,&#8221; or as the subject of the &#8220;gaze.&#8221;[13]</p>            <p class="second">Ever mindful of the audience of the photographs,               Lange and other F.S.A. photographers worked to convey the message               that the possible recipients of federal relief programs were not               <em>lazy</em>, but that they were decent, hard-working people who               were victims of something they alone were powerless to change, the               Great Depression. Affluent urbanite viewers of the photograph in               its popular published form (Figure 3), after all, were well aware               that President Roosevelt had a year earlier, at their insistence,               finally eliminated a New Deal program which gave open-ended cash               payments to the unemployed.[14] (In the words of Roosevelt, &#8220;To               dole out relief in this way was is to administer a narcotic, a subtle               destroyer of the human spirit. &#8230;Work must be found for able-bodied,               but destitute workers&#8221;).[15] By creating and distributing               an image of <em>only</em> the plantation owner &#8211; proud, able-bodied               and down-to-earth, Lange&#8217;s photograph was altered to fit the               explicit mission of the Farm Security Administration perfectly.               We see a man with spirit who seeks no pity, works hard and deserves               our help.</p>            <p class="second">But curiously, given the opportunity to frame and               capture this very image (Figure 3) herself, Lange chose <em>not</em>               to move closer to the plantation owner and focus solely on him.               Instead she made the conscious choice to frame the portly white               man in front of the black plantation workers, who sit and stand               idly behind him. (Figure 1) The workers are thin and diminutive               in comparison to the presence of the landowner, who dominates the               image.[16] When the viewer looks past the plantation owner to consider               the men on the porch, suddenly visions of fortitude and the &#8220;American               Dream&#8221;&#8217;s availability to all hard-working people are               destabilized. Lange prompts us to face the fact that in 1936 in               Mississippi, the notion of equality and the promise of unbridled               opportunity to all citizens did not apply to all people of all races               &#8211; no matter what the Declaration of Independence or Roosevelt&#8217;s               &#8220;Four Freedoms&#8221; speech might have promised.[17] Lange&#8217;s               photograph is intentionally provocative, and it unveils inequalities               and presents problems inherent in the myth of America as a land               of equal opportunity. But the very capturing of this image in a               time and a place where lynchings were still commonplace &#8211;               and were executed by white upper classes (if we recall, viewers               of published F.S.A. photographs were also white and were from the               upper classes) &#8211; was a risky political endeavor.[18] Because               Lange&#8217;s images were so racially charged, and because they               critiqued America&#8217;s social problems at a time when the country&#8217;s               economic infrastructure was in shambles and the New Deal was needed               to reassure affluent white voters of their elevated status, the               F.S.A. created a generously-cropped version of the original image               which is devoid of any reference to the plantation workers (except               for the tiny distant head of a black man who peeps over the front               of the car, just below the Coca-Cola sign). (Figure 3) This image               seems to have been altered in the darkroom to darken both the Cola-Cola               sign and the black man&#8217;s face until the ode to capitalism               sang loudly and the black man&#8217;s face tellingly fell into obscurity               in the background. Thus, the image&#8217;s political content was               reframed to meet the mission of the F.S.A. and to promote Roosevelt&#8217;s               politics while downplaying or rather, eliminating, Lange&#8217;s               own political view.</p>            <p class="second">But another important level of reinterpretation               and recontextualization of Lange&#8217;s photographs occurred after               they left the hands of Roy Stryker and the F.S.A. and were adapted               to meet the varying needs of individual publications. By virtue               of the F.S.A.&#8217;s policy of allowing publishers unrestricted,               unsupervised reproduction of the images, Lange&#8217;s &#8220;Plantation               Overseer. Mississippi Delta, Near Clarksdale, Mississippi&#8221;               was among thousands of images which were reinterpreted by editors               or art directors at various media outlets by re-cropping the photographs,               by positioning them next to other images, or by adding text.[19]               These subtle decisions altered possible interpretations and guided               readers to view the photographs in differing contexts at the unfettered               discretion of individual publications. The F.S.A. asserted no claim               or control over the use of the images.[20]</p>            <p class="second">For example, when the poet Archibald MacLeish aspired               to write a book-length poem in response to images from the F.S.A.&#8217;s               archives, he selected the cropped version of Lange&#8217;s image               (Figure 3) as one of 88 photographs to illustrate his short book               <em>Land of the Free</em> (1938).[21] (Figure 4) The photograph               that appears in MacLeish&#8217;s book is even more tightly cropped               than the F.S.A. version.[22] (Figure 3) The plantation owner&#8217;s               hat is skimmed by the edge of the frame, providing a point of tension               at the top of the photograph and suggesting that the exact cropping               of the image was subject to production and printing constraints.               In this case, however, the most radical reinterpretation of the               image is not the way it was cropped, but its complete recontextualization               by nearby literature. MacLeish&#8217;s poem (Figure 5) shares an               open-page spread with Lange&#8217;s image. The entire poem spans               the length of the book and its basic plot unfolds as follows: (1)               Because &#8220;we&#8221; owned our land and were self-sufficient,               &#8220;we Americans&#8221; were free. (2) Now those days are over,               and dust storms, droughts and the Great Depression have forced &#8220;us&#8221;               to leave our land, &#8220;we&#8221; wonder if our freedom is gone,               too. (3) &#8220;We&#8221; wonder whether rugged individualism &#8211;               the very spirit that raped and conquered America &#8211; has passed.               MacLeish suggests that &#8220;we&#8221; must band together to survive               and must fight against the social and natural forces that oppress               us. &#8220;We&#8221; can no longer be free without each other.[23]               Thus, MacLeish proposes in 1938 that the notion of human solidarity               is necessary in our industrial-minded, interdependent society. </p>            <table width="625" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td width="296"><img src="images/belden5.jpg" width="296" height="300"></td>                <td width="26">&nbsp;</td>                <td width="303"><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Archibald MacLeish,                   poem accompanying Lange&#8217;s image in Land of the Free.</td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">A version of Lange&#8217;s image without the black               laborers present is adjacent to the part of the poem in which &#8220;we&#8221;               connect our freedom to our land-ownership (Figure 4). (This is step               one of the poem&#8217;s plot. On the next two pages we see a dramatic               turn as Lange&#8217;s <em>Migrant Mother</em> appears next to the               words &#8220;Now we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;)[24] Within the imposed               literary context, we see Lange&#8217;s plantation owner as he thinks               about his freedom. He tells himself he is free because he is just               &#8220;that kind,&#8221; because he knows that freedom is just &#8220;a               grit in your craw.&#8221; Our plantation owner&#8217;s freedom and               apparent grit were bestowed upon him by the Battle of Bunker Hill               and the Constitution. Freedom is his birthright. It is his presumption.               He owns land, therefore he is free. (Therefore, it seems logical               that the black farm workers be excluded from this image because               they do not own land, and following MacLeish&#8217;s logic, they               must not be free. Thus, MacLeish re-contextualizes Lange&#8217;s               photograph of racial oppression and changes it into a sympathetic               portrait of a rural American ruminating about freedom). </p>            <p class="second">But MacLeish&#8217;s poem then takes command of               the plot of this man&#8217;s life and implies that the plantation               owner is two pages away from losing everything he owns. Yet no information               provided by Lange supports the implication that this man lost his               land in the Great Depression or in the onset of mass farming.[25]               In addition to adapting photography such as Lange&#8217;s to suit               the needs of the poem, MacLeish gives real humans an unreal voice.               This may (and likely, does) present an inaccurate distortion of               the photograph&#8217;s subjects&#8217; life stories. According to               John Rogers Puckett, the possibility of allowing the subjects of               the photographs to speak for themselves is tempting:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Here its [the poem&#8217;s] use seems a bit condescending,                 for it undercuts the dignity of the people pictured by making                 them seem as vague, lost and inarticulate as the poem&#8217;s                 persona appears to be. Had these people been interviewed and allowed                 to speak for themselves, any inarticulateness would be more acceptable                 &#8211; at least their voices would be authentic.[26]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">But this position raises interesting questions about               suppositions of authenticity. Curiously, no readers object to the               inherently subjective nature of MacLeish&#8217;s writing. Yet when               the poems are coupled with photographs &#8211; which are assumed               to somehow be more &#8220;objective&#8221; than words &#8211; concerns               about the possible exploitation of the photographs&#8217; subjects               abound.[27] MacLeish&#8217;s assumption of the task of giving these               photographs a new narrative story may have been because their status               as recognizable icons or symbols invites reinterpretation in the               absence of hints of literary specificity.[28] According to Martha               Rosler, images which become &#8220;symbolic&#8221; are &#8220;debased&#8221;               and have &#8220;content-free content.&#8221;[29] (Although it seems               more likely that the images contain an entirely new and just as               politicized content). In other words, because these pictures cannot               tell us their stories in their own words, we are eager to assume               the task and to become their voices. But in this process, the stories               inevitably become politically motivated. Allan Sekula suggests that               the relationship of photographs to their discourse (whether that               discourse is determined by the context in which each of Lange&#8217;s               images are used, or the context of the discourse she might have               intended when she shot the photographs) is always inherently tied               to specific interests, and the resulting photographs speak with               a &#8220;voice of anonymous authority and preclude the possibility               of anything but affirmation.&#8221;[30] Every image has an argument               and is endowed with a motivated &#8211; and thereby politicized               &#8211; message. The many versions of Lange&#8217;s <em>Plantation               Overseer. Mississippi Delta, Near Clarksdale, Mississippi</em> are               certainly no exception. Despite the F.S.A.&#8217;s reformist aspirations,               it was an organization which had a mission to promote the Roosevelt               administration&#8217;s social policies through humanist appeals               to an upper-class audience &#8211; while doing little to challenge               the problematic assumptions of the American myth (such as equality               for all citizens). A study of several versions of Lange&#8217;s               <em>Plantation Overseer</em> photograph reveals that political motivations               were manifest at every stage of the image-making process &#8211;               from Lange&#8217;s composition and selection of the photographs,               to Stryker&#8217;s editing, cropping and distribution of them in               order to promote the goals of the F.S.A., to the individual publications&#8217;               recontextualization of the photograph to convey another specific               but often different message. Each time the photographs were used,               they were endowed with a new set of political meanings and interpretive               possibilities. But given their role as publicity devices for Roosevelt&#8217;s               reform program, this seems only appropriate. </p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Kris Belden-Adams</strong> is working on               her doctoral dissertation on photography's complicated relationship               to time at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>            <p class="second">[1] One notable exception is a book published about               40 years later, which featured the image as an illustration of sharecropping.               (Figure 6) See F. Jack Hurley, <em>Portrait of a Decade: Roy Stryker               and the Development of Documentary Photography in the Thirties</em>               (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972), 19. However,               Lange&#8217;s original lengthy caption does not identify the farm               workers as sharecroppers. It is very possible that the men were               temporary workers or &#8220;wage hands&#8221; instead, according               to Melvyn Dubofsky and Stephen Burwood, <em>The Great Depression               and the New Deal: Women and Minorities During the Great Depression</em>               (New York and London: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1990), 170-217.               The potential misidentification of the men in Lange&#8217;s image               as &#8220;sharecroppers&#8221; was a result of the picture&#8217;s               proximity to re-contextualizing verbiage. (Incidentally, in contemporary               journalistic practice, leading a reader to make misidentifications               due to intentional or unintentional text/photo association is regarded               as a form of libel against the subjects of the image.) These misleading               uses of F.S.A. photography were very common, and they resulted from               the organization&#8217;s policy of giving up the control of the               use of their photographs by outside publications. Stryker himself               admits this in a 1973 essay; see Roy Emerson Stryker, &#8220;The               F.S.A.

In order to distance the administration               from the previous policies &#8211; which included making cash payments               to the unemployed &#8211; the 1935 policy shift prompted the re-labeling               of the entire relief-program institution as the &#8220;Second New               Deal.&#8221; Ironically, in another brilliantly spin-doctored move,               F.D.R.&#8217;s administration was also criticized for over-taxing               the lower classes to pay for these very programs, rather than taxing               the upper classes. In response to these criticisms, Roosevelt&#8217;s               administration publicized a drive for &#8220;soak the rich&#8221;               taxation, which Amenta argues was largely rhetorical in nature because               it produced no new revenue.

In this book, Puckett               discusses the interaction of photography and text as it relates               to the use of New Deal photographs in the following projects: <em>You               Have Seen Their Faces</em>, <em>Land of the Free</em>, <em>12 Million               Black Voices</em>, <em>An American Exodus</em> and <em>Let Us Now               Praise Famous Men</em>.<br>              [21] Ibid., 50.<br>              [22] MacLeish, 7-8.<br>              [23] Ibid. The use of a phantom, undefined &#8220;we&#8221; persists               throughout the poem. &#8220;We&#8221; appears to unite the author,               a Chicago native who lived in major cities throughout his life,               with the rural poor subjects of the photograph and with the viewer/reader.               &#8220;We&#8221; is a social-class-transcendent term which serves               to unite all Americans while conveniently ignoring obvious social               and racial differences. It should be noted that while this poem               was not popular, MacLeish won two Pulitzer Prizes for poetry-writing               during his lifetime, and was lauded as one of America&#8217;s best               formalist poets.<br>              [24] Ibid., 9-10.<br>              [25] Legally speaking, MacLeish would be committing an act of libel               for presenting the plantation owner in a &#8220;false light&#8221;               if indeed the plantation owner never lost his property &#8211; and               if MacLeish implied that in editions of his book published after               1964 (<em>New York Times vs. Sullivan</em>). <br>              [26] Puckett, 49.<br>              [27] Ibid., 50 and Allan Sekula. &#8220;On the Invention of Photographic               Meaning,&#8221; <em>Photography in Print</em> (New York: Simon and               Schuster, 1981). F.S.A. photographs in particular occasionally walk               the line between reportage and metaphor, according to Sekula.<br>              [28] Rosler, 185. This is especially the case with Lange&#8217;s               Migrant Mother, Rosler argues.<br>              [29] Ibid. It should also be noted that Rosler believes that these               &#8220;debased&#8221; images cease to have a political dimension.               I would argue that just the opposite is true, because the photographs               carry the meaning for which they became symbolic. This set of references               is assigned and encouraged by the entity that enabled them to be               symbolic images to begin with (in the case of the images I am discussing,               that entity is the F.S.A.). <br>              [30] Sekula, 453.</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>For Further Reading:</strong></p>            <p> Amenta, Edwin. <em>Bold Relief: Institutional Politics and the               Origins of Modern American Social Policy</em>.
