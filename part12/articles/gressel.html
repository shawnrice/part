But unlike the typical newscast,                 this story had a different twist: youth represented themselves.[1]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">On June 9, 1994, 220 teenagers assembled in 100               cars on a rooftop garage in Oakland, CA. They came together to talk               openly, with predetermined topics but no script, in front of &#8220;eavesdropping&#8221;               audiences and cameras. These 100 simultaneous conversations addressed               topics relevant to teens such as sex, violence and gender roles.             </p>            <p class="second">The <em>Roof is on Fire</em> performance was the               culminating event in a series of collaborative activities between               artists Suzanne Lacy and Chris Johnson, artist/producer Annice Jacoby,               public school teachers, and Oakland youth under the Acronym TEAM               (Teens + Educators + Artists + Media Makers). <em>Roof</em> was               also the first of a series of large-scale TEAM projects that took               place between 1991-2000, including <em>Youth, Cops, and Videotape</em>,               a video from a workshop that continues to be used in police training.[2]               In her work with TEAM, Lacy hoped to empower youth, impact larger               social policies, and challenge uses of mass media.</p>            <p class="second">Suzanne Lacy&#8217;s work is difficult to categorize.               A project such as <em>The Roof is on Fire</em> could be considered               visual art, performance art or film, but could just as easily be               education, social work, or political intervention. The TEAM projects               exemplify Lacy&#8217;s desire to contribute to the existing discourse               of public art by creating, defining, and critiquing interdisciplinary               new art forms. In &#8220;Cultural Pilgrimages and Metaphoric Journeys&#8221;               (1993), Lacy defines her work as &#8220;new genre&#8221; public               art, or &#8220;art that uses both traditional and nontraditional               media to communicate and interact with a broad and diversified audience               about issues directly relevant to their lives&#8230;based on engagement.&#8221;[3]               Artists like Suzanne Lacy are considered pioneers in the field of               public art because of their ability to address political subject               matter through engaging the talents and voices of others. Lacy also               uses mass media techniques and highly publicized venues to bring               this art into a wider arena than that associated with previous community-based               public art. </p>            <p class="second">In &#8220;Cultural Pilgrimages,&#8221; Lacy also               addresses the problem of evaluating the impact of this genre of               socially-engaged art, which many artists define in terms of a complex               web of relationships rather than tangible artistic products. Lacy               describes how &#8220;all art posits a space between the artist and               the perceiver of the work, traditionally filled with the relationship               between artist and audience&#8230;for some, [this] relationship               <em>is</em> the artwork.&#8221;[4]</p>            <p class="second">When considering this type of art, must we identify               and evaluate the types of relationships created rather than any               one artistic &#8220;product?&#8221; In &#8220;An Unfashionable Audience&#8221;               (1995), public art curator Mary Jane Jacob suggests that the effectiveness               of art as an &#8220;instrument for social change&#8221; can be evaluated               based on a series of different relationships: The first is &#8220;emblematic,&#8221;               defined by the ability of artworks to relate to &#8220;the social               problem&#8230;or by their presence in a public setting&#8230;inspire               change.&#8221; The second is &#8220;supportive,&#8221; defined by               the ability of the work to &#8220;ultimately feed back into an actual               social system&#8221; or directly relate to other viable social services.               The third is &#8220;participatory,&#8221; defined by the ability               of the artwork to grow out of a collaborative process that involves               complex relationships between artists, community participants, and               audiences.[5] <em>The Roof is on Fire</em> is considered exemplary               of all three relationships Jacob describes, in its ability to attack               the social problem of the stereotyping of youth by the media; feed               into a complex system of institutions that shaped youth education               and policy; and engage those most affected by the project&#8212;the               youth themselves&#8212;in its creation. </p>            <p class="second">Recent critiques of socially engaged public art,               however, have identified two problematic aspects of this type of               art (and the evaluation criteria posited by Jacob): its inability               to produce real and lasting institutional change, and its rejection               of conceptual or formal rigor in favor of the suggested social benefits               it brings to nebulously defined &#8220;communities.&#8221; Patricia               Phillips cites critic Miwon Kwon, among others, as &#8220;questioning               this community-based work for its opportunistic involvement of individuals               in order to produce work with little lasting significance for the               community that it employs (or exploits).&#8221; According to Kwon,</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">In recent years, efforts have&#8230; become formulaic:                 artist + community + social issues = new (public/critical) art...                 In turn, these &quot;communities,&quot; identified as &quot;targets&quot;                 for collaboration in which... members will perform as subjects                 and co-producers for their own appropriation, are often conceived                 to be ready-made and fixed entities rather than fluid and multiple.                 The result is an artificial categorization of peoples and their                 reasons for coming together.[6]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">In her 2002 seminal work on site-specific art, <em>One               Place After Another: Site Specific Art and Locational Identity</em>,               Kwon critically assesses a work of Suzanne Lacy&#8217;s, <em>Full               Circle</em>, as an example of a &#8220;community of mythic unity&#8221;               which highlights the presence of common beliefs or characteristics               in a group of people, most often united by race, gender, or cause.[7]               Kwon critiques &#8220;mythic unity&#8221; collaborations on the               grounds that while they might involve the community in decision-making,               the collaborators&#8217; role is most often to &#8220;perform and               signify the decentralization of the artist&#8217;s authority in               defining the &#8216;content&#8217;&#8221; of the project. The act               of &#8220;delegating authority&#8221; makes the artist herself an               authority; thus these types of projects do not, in Kwon&#8217;s               mind, break traditional boundaries between artist and community.[8]               They also favor a &#8220;mythically&#8221; united &#8220;community&#8221;               over personal narratives. </p>            <p class="second">For Lacy, however, it is important to retain a sense               of herself as the &#8220;artist&#8221; in all of her projects; in               &#8220;Cultural Pilgrimages&#8221; she explicitly states that she               does not want to &#8220;discard the model of isolated authorship.&#8221;[9]               As I will discuss later, while much of the project-planning in <em>The               Roof is on Fire</em> involved a collaborative process between Lacy,               co-artist Chris Johnson, artist/producer Annice Jacoby, and the               youth and educators in TEAM, the idea of staging youth-led conversations               on a rooftop grew out of Lacy&#8217;s original vision. Does the               inventiveness of an individual artist contribute to a collaborative               project&#8217;s social or educational impact, or does such artistic               leadership detract from the decision-making and empowerment that               participants can experience? Why is it important that such political               advocacy projects be identified as works of art? </p>            <p class="second">Critic Claire Bishop implies that community-based               projects are in danger of losing their artistic rigor if they are               evaluated solely on their social impact:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">The urgency of this political task has led to                 a situation in which such collaborative practices are automatically                 perceived to be equally important artistic gestures of resistance:                 There can be no failed, unsuccessful, unresolved, or boring works                 of collaborative art because all are equally essential to the                 task of strengthening the social bond. I would argue that it is                 also crucial to discuss, analyze, and compare such work critically                 as art.[10]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">If such works are to be evaluated as &#8220;art,&#8221;               can they be discussed by traditional methods of art criticism that               consider their visual and formal elements? To answer this question,               In <em>Conversation Pieces: Community + Communication in Modern               Art</em> (2004), Grant Kester defines a new aesthetic of <em>dialogical</em>               art. Discussing projects such as Lacy&#8217;s works with TEAM, he               attempts to qualify the discursive process behind such work, or               as Jacob might define it, the relationships that it creates. Kester               describes this new aesthetic as a rejection of both the concept               of a finished work of art, and of an artist&#8217;s individual authorship.               Instead, he describes dialogical art as a process in which the interactions               that take place between artists and audiences are defined as the               work of art itself: </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">The emphasis is on the character of this interaction,                 not the physical or formal integrity of a given artifact or the                 artist&#8217;s experience in producing it. Further, the physical                 object remains essentially static. Dialogical projects, in contrast,                 unfold through a process of transformative interaction.[11]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">In his final chapter, after discussing Suzanne Lacy&#8217;s               TEAM projects, Kester admits that one of the things he has omitted               from his discussion is &#8220;the visual dimension of these projects.&#8221;[12]               It is certainly important to critique a work like Lacy&#8217;s in               terms of the quality of the exchange between its artists, participants,               and audiences and how they contribute to a larger framework of social               change. I therefore do not reject Kester&#8217;s or Jacob&#8217;s               idea of creating a discursive or relational aesthetic in order to               characterize new genre public art projects. I will argue, however,               that the artists or orchestrators of such projects do often devote               a great deal of attention to traditional &#8220;physical or formal&#8221;               qualities; Lacy&#8217;s tight aesthetic control over her works contributes               to their social impact. Bishop suggests that there is value in a               work of socially engaged art which, in the traditional Modernist               sense, surprises audiences with unexpected images and ideas, and               engages them through multiple points of contact. <em>The Roof is               on Fire</em> can serve as one example of how art objects and formal               structures of visual art and performance exist alongside and in               fact complement and enable discourse and social action, both for               the participants in the piece and for a larger audience of immediate               and future viewers. </p>            <p class="second">While I will explore the types of social and institutional               relationships fostered by <em>Roof</em>, I will also use it as an               example of the role of &#8220;artful&#8221; elements in political               action or community building strategies. I will argue that the complex               formal qualities of such a work, including individual &#8220;objects,&#8221;               play a vital role in creating a non-traditional space for dialogue,               giving participants new tools to express themselves and providing               a tangible way for current and future audiences to engage in a longer-term               dialogic relationship with the piece. Finally, I will consider how               <em>The Roof is on Fire</em> exemplifies a specific type of aesthetic               that can be an integral component of socially-engaged, dialogue-based               art. </p>            <p align="center" class="second">**********************</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> There are a number of contemporary artists and                 art collectives that have defined their practice precisely around                 the facilitation of dialogue among diverse communities. Parting                 from the traditions of object-making, these artists&#8230;are                 &#8220;context providers&#8221; rather than &#8220;content providers.[13]<br>                ~ Grant Kester</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"> <em>The Roof is on Fire</em> has been characterized               by Suzanne Lacy herself, co-organizer Annice Jacoby, and critics               such as Kester as a multi-stage process rather than a singular cultural               product, which at each juncture addressed problems facing inner               city youth and the institutions that perpetuated these problems.               Through acting as artists and participants in this process themselves,               the teenagers involved in <em>Roof</em> were empowered to challenge               these stereotypes. </p>            <p class="second"><em>The Roof is on Fire</em> was created as a direct               response to the social and cultural climate of Oakland in the early               1990s. Yet unlike many works of political and public art that restrict               themselves to very specific issues, <em>Roof</em> also challenged,               on a large scale, social phenomena perceived by its organizers as               significant national trends of the early 1990s: deep-seeded misperceptions               of poor neighborhoods and youth of color perpetuated by the mass               media. Oakland was a prime breeding ground for negative portrayals               of youth in the media, altruistic desires to remedy the situation,               and fascination with the culture and ideas of youth, in particular               inner city youth. </p>            <p class="second">Lacy&#8217;s writings on TEAM in a later artist&#8217;s               statement imply that she was drawn to its &#8220;history of political               activism, diversity and culture&#8230;with a public school population               of 55% African American, 20% Latino/a, 20% Asian American, and 5%               European American students.&#8221;[14] Yet Oakland was also highly               divided. In addition to its historically African-American demographic,               the city was experiencing an influx of Mexican-American immigrants,               and corresponding negative media campaigns directed against the               two million illegal immigrants in the state of California.[15] Wealthier               residents occupied the outlying Hills, geographically separated               from areas of poverty. </p>            <p class="second">Lacy also recognized that Oakland&#8217;s youth,               which comprised 25% of its population in 1990, were &#8220;beset               with high rates of violent crime, poverty and school drop-out.&#8221;[16]               The arrest rate among Oakland youth had increased by 35 percent               during that decade.[17] The number of 15-to-19 year-old sexual assault               victims had risen 26 percent between 1990 and 1991.[18] Statistics               compiled in 1995 from a variety of sources, including the National               Center for Health Statistics, Journal of the American Medical Association               and the Office of the Attorney General of California, showed increasing               youth violence in American culture and the state of California in               particular: in 1990, 4,941 children in the U.S. under the age of               19 years died from gunshot wounds, with 538 of these children shot               unintentionally. Homicide was the second leading cause of death               among all young people ages 15 to 24, and the leading cause of death               among young African American males. One-fifth of all murders of               youth in the country occurred in California.[19]</p>            <p class="second">In addition to the shocking statistics being published,               mass media coverage of young people emphasized the problem of youth               violence. Most public knowledge of &#8220;inner-city&#8221; communities               such as Oakland&#8217;s came from sensational media coverage of               catastrophic events such as the 1991 Rodney King riots. A 1993 study               by the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania               exposed the fact that minorities were being stereotyped on TV as               violent, un-educated, and without ambition.[20] TEAM&#8217;s organizers               believed that, particularly at this moment, it was difficult to               challenge mainstream communication channels. According to project               co-organizer Annice Jacoby, after 1990, television and news sources               had become increasingly monopolized by large corporations. She describes               the mass media at that time as a particularly &#8220;impenetrable               fortress&#8230;mostly in the hands of the few who had control of               television broadcasts and major newspapers.&#8221;[21]</p>            <p class="second">No group was more endangered by this trend than               the teenagers themselves, and this decade also saw a rising awareness               and concern with the influence of the media on the young and impressionable.               A 1994 Department of Education study demonstrated that academic               achievement dropped sharply in students who watched more than ten               hours of television per week.[22] However, TEAM&#8217;s organizers               perceived that most low-income youth in particular were not being               taught at home or in school to critically analyze violent, racist,               and sexist media stereotypes. Bombarded with negative stories being               told <em>about</em> them by others and lacking educational and social               resources with which to challenge these stereotypes, these youth               were &#8220;at risk&#8221; of having no reason to believe that their               own lives could follow an alternate course the one presented by               the mass media.</p>            <p class="second"> Besides being feared by the public, low-income               youth were commonly lumped together as victims of a corrupt system,               a sociological &#8220;problem&#8221; to be solved. In Oakland, local               leaders focused on issues pertinent to urban youth. When TEAM was               first conceived, Oakland was governed by Elihu Harris, an African-American               mayor who earned the reputation of a &#8220;people&#8217;s champion&#8221;               for his efforts to revitalize Oakland after a 1989 earthquake and               a 1991 firestorm, as well as his support of innovative ways to address               community issues. Harris had a particular interest in children and               education, launching educational endeavors such as Camp Read-A-Lot               and Project 2000, Ready to Learn.[23] Oakland had also recently               become part of the first youth violence prevention advocacy program               in the United States, Teens of Target (TNT), a project of Youth               ALIVE. Through TNT, core groups of urban youth in Oakland and Los               Angeles put together a training manual to help teach their peers               leadership skills. The support of both government and community               leaders would be essential to the success of <em>Roof</em>. Lacy               describes Oakland as a &#8220;nationally recognized center for urban               youth culture&#8221; and &#8220;the site of a developing public               voice for youth&#8230;home to celebrities Danny Glover, M.C. Hammer,               and Tony! Toni! Ton&eacute;!&#8221;[24]</p>            <p class="second">Situated within this contradictory climate of both               fear and well-intentioned outreach towards inner-city youth, <em>Roof</em>               posed a challenging question: Has anyone sought to listen to what               these teenagers themselves have to say about their lives? TEAM was               founded on the belief that Oakland youth should have the chance               to both deconstruct media stereotypes and express their individual               voices and talents in mass media venues. This would ideally provide               a powerful antidote to the mass media&#8217;s negative portrayals               of the inner city and manipulation of teen audiences. </p>            <p class="second">To allow Oakland teenagers to tell their stories,               Lacy and her collaborators had to function more as facilitators               than artists, designing the means for <em>others</em> to express               themselves. In order to make teens&#8217; voices heard in mainstream               arenas, the artists also had to act as educators and event-planners,               and include diverse constituencies in the artistic process. Lacy               and her team first sought to give youth the tools to deconstruct               mass media messages. In 1991-2, Lacy and Chris Johnson collaborated               with four teachers at Oakland Technical High School to create and               teach a media literacy curriculum. Next, teenagers were empowered               to address their own situation rather than rely on the well-intentioned               efforts of outsiders. This empowerment took the form of dialogue-based               performance art combined with leadership opportunities. After participating               in the workshops for a year, the initial group of students from               Oakland Technical staged <em>Teen Age Living Room</em>, a small               performance sketch at California College of Arts and Crafts that               provided the vision for <em>The Roof is on Fire</em>. The year after               that project, Lacy and Johnson approached the school district and               created, for a series of fifteen nominated faculty members from               all eight public high schools, a class on media literacy. The weekly               series of workshops, with special guests in education, sociology,               and media, provided the teachers with a way to develop their own               curriculum materials on these topics. Several of the fifteen teachers               decided to work with the two artists the following semester on a               performance, which would become <em>The Roof is on Fire</em>. Each               of these faculty members selected a group of students from his or               her classes and brought approximately forty of these leaders to               weekly meetings after school.[25]</p>            <p class="second">From this group, fifteen students were elected for               the Youth Steering Committee, which participated in all aspects               of production and media coverage for the event. Other students served               as recruiters.[26] Design, promotion, and content decisions were               made collectively by the artists and this steering committee, making               youth leadership an integral part of the work. This aspect of the               project was not without controversy. As the performance date approached               and tensions grew, some youth organizers, according to Lacy, &#8220;felt               like the adults didn&#8217;t give them as much leadership as they               wanted&#8230;[there were also controversies] between the youth as               they struggled over what issues to address&#8212;homosexuality was               quite loaded for example&#8212;and there was a struggle for the               image, including whether the performance would take place in cars               or on a bus.&#8221;[27] Perhaps the act of working through these               issues in itself had value for the youth involved; Lacy&#8217;s               careful assessment of this process suggests that she saw them as               key decision-makers with respect to both content and design. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Roof</em> was conceived as a project which,               unlike most educational collaborations, would have an impact in               a larger public sphere beyond the classroom or even the schools.               Suzanne Lacy&#8217;s particular background enabled her to advocate               at high administrative levels as well as at the grassroots level               in order to create a large-scale public arena where diverse viewpoints               could be heard. As dean of the School of Fine Arts at the reputable               California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, she had access               to colleagues and students to help carry out the project. Collaborating               artist Chris Johnson was a well-known photographer and also CCAC               faculty. Lacy&#8217;s connections to Oakland&#8217;s top officials,               including mayor Elihu Harris, helped her secure both the highly               public venue of the rooftop parking garage, and access to mainstream               news channels that would air the performance. Working closely with               both teachers and government officials would eventually allow Lacy               and TEAM to actively participate in crafting new youth-related policies,               moving from discourse to concrete action.</p>            <p class="second"> <em>Roof</em> was also distinguished from other               youth/artist collaborations by its direct relationship to mass media.               The final and perhaps most important principle behind Roof was that               youth empowerment activities must receive as much media attention               as portrayals of youth as criminals, victims, or entertainers. Thus               publicizing the event was essential, and this involved artistic               as well as practical decisions borrowed from traditions of both               media documentation and popular advertising. The performance was               aggressively advertised as free and open to the general public.               Media specialist Annice Jacoby organized all aspects of promotion               and news coverage. She worked with youth from the Leadership committee,               teaching them how to approach the media, and working with them to               create the poster slogan &#8220;Shut up and listen.&#8221; <em>The               Roof Is On Fire</em> aired as a one-hour documentary by the Bay               Area&#8217;s local NBC affiliate and was covered extensively on               local and national news stations, even weeks after the event itself.               However, instead of simply acting as a &#8220;service to the art,&#8221;               the media became &#8220;the platform and medium itself.&#8221;[28]</p>            <p class="second">The orchestrators of <em>Roof</em> were not only               ambitious in the scope of the audiences they wished to reach, but               in the demands they made on these audiences. At the event, instead               of a traditional theatrical set-up, cars contained different conversations               taking place simultaneously. People accustomed to watching plays               or concerts from their seats were challenged to wander from car               to car, view the performance from several angles, and make choices               about the messages they wished to absorb. Audiences also had to               accept that there would be no universal conclusion at the end of               the performance; each individual could potentially walk away with               a slightly different narrative. However, while given the autonomy               to selectively listen, audience members were not permitted to participate               in the conversations or pose questions, the way they might at a               symposium or panel discussion. The performance highlighted the importance               of being an &#8220;audience&#8221; in the broadest sense of the               word: the importance of listening. Without the safe distance from               their audience associated with performing on stage, the youth &#8220;performers&#8221;               also faced challenges. They spent weeks practicing speaking freely               and ignoring audiences in simulated situations. Youth accustomed               to being judged or talked back to by adults had to suspend traditional               notions of their relationship to listeners. </p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/gressel2.jpg" width="200" height="132"></p>            <p class="second">The significance of this final performance was heightened               by the fact that in June 1994, a youth &#8220;riot&#8221; occurred               at the city&#8217;s annual summer festival, days before the <em>Roof</em>               performance was slated to take place. According to the description               of the media coverage of this event on Suzanne Lacy&#8217;s Web               site, </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Later investigation revealed the role of the police                 in escalating what began as a minor incident, but an enduring                 legacy was a television news clip of a youth putting his foot                 through a plate glass window -- an instant replay that captured                 the imagination of a country afraid of its own offspring.[29]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The subsequent news coverage and documentary of               <em>Roof</em> allowed audiences at this key moment to contrast the               riot images with a very different picture of Oakland&#8217;s &#8220;offspring.&#8221;               In the video, teens&#8217; individual voices surface, especially               youth who were interviewed extensively about their lives, such as               Brandy Thomas, a sixteen-year-old single mother earning top grades               in high school. After listening to Brandy we can no longer accept               common assumptions that teen mothers have no hope of escaping a               life on welfare. In this video youth are neither riotous criminals               nor victims; they are ordinary people with ambitions who can converse               intelligently about the world in which they live. </p>            <p align="center" class="second">**********************</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> The problem with the media is that it has the                 tendency to evaporate the next day.[30]<br>                ~ Annice Jacoby</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"> In evaluating all of her work, Suzanne Lacy seeks               to determine whether such collaborative, socially-charged events               can act as catalysts for more widespread change. She has written               about how this is extremely difficult to measure, partly because               of the challenge of tracking audiences, or linking artistic causes               to social effects. The evidence Lacy has collected to show the long-term               impact of TEAM is mostly anecdotal and on the individual level:               a recent phone call from a young woman who, now an adult, was a               participant in <em>Roof</em> at age 15 and still remembers the project;               the five past participants with whom Lacy is still in touch who               are now pursuing graduate degrees or doing youth development work               themselves.[31]</p>            <p class="second">In &#8220;Debated Territory: Toward a Critical Language               for Public Art&#8221; (1995), Lacy suggests that &#8220;continuity&#8221;               can be a &#8220;measure of both the artist&#8217;s responsibility               and the work&#8217;s success.&#8221; She defines this as &#8220;sustaining               or continuing a connection begun through the artwork as an expression               of personal responsibility.&#8221;[32] In some cases continuity               can merely involve the artist giving community leaders the tools               to continue the work he or she has begun. It could be argued that               Lacy was successful in achieving &#8220;continuity&#8221; with the               Oakland community and therefore &#8220;success,&#8221; simply because               she is still in contact with many of the original participants,               and <em>Roof</em> and TEAM sparked a ten-year artistic collaboration               that overlapped with fields such as public policy, youth/police               relations, and education reform. This sense of commitment provides               a model for new genre public art collaborations to offer more comprehensive               and concrete solutions to social problems than the creation of the               temporary, &#8220;mythically unified&#8221; community.</p>            <p class="second">Yet in &#8220;Finding Our Way to the Flag: Is Civic               Discourse Art?&#8221;(2003), published a few years after the last               TEAM project, Lacy claims that</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">After ten years of highly public programming,                 several large performances, scores of televised reports and documentaries,                 over 1,000 youth in art and video workshops, and models invented                 for police training programs and student-teacher interventions,                 the institutions that would continue to effect the lives of Oakland                 youth remained substantially unchanged.[33]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Did <em>Roof</em> therefore fail to achieve its               political advocacy goals? More quantitative research could track               the number of people impacted and other changes in institutional               data. Yet Lacy herself does not necessarily believe this type of               evaluation is appropriate for her work, and instead suggests that               because it is meant to be &#8220;art,&#8221; it must be measured               according to more abstract criteria. She describes how</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">methods traditionally used to measure change,                 drawn from the political or social sciences, are never, to my                 knowledge, actually applied [to new genre public art projects].                 The language for doing so is not in place, and even if it were,                 we are reluctant to reduce our critical evaluation to one of the                 numbers, or even, for that matter, to personal testimonies. Concrete                 results in the public sphere, and how those reflect the artist&#8217;s                 intentions, may occasionally be illustrative of a work&#8217;s                 success but fall short, as they do not capture all the varied                 levels on which art operates.[34]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The absence of comprehensive empirical measurements               of <em>Roof</em>&#8217;s impact on youth is in itself an argument               for the importance of evaluating the formal, or &#8220;artistic&#8221;               qualities of the work devised by the project&#8217;s organizers,               and how they contributed to the multiple stages of the project.               In &#8220;Finding Our Way to the Flag,&#8221; Lacy also states her               belief that &#8220;it is of critical importance to the arts to locate               these art practices within the trajectory of art history, to give               real texture and meaning to the notion of artist citizenship and               in doing so accomplish the reconstruction of the civic relevance               of art.&#8221;[35]</p>            <p class="second">In a work that incorporates practices of radical               education, mass media, and public advocacy and provokes new definitions               of art and aesthetics, what formal or object-based components surface               and what is their relevance to true &#8220;civic discourse?&#8221;               To begin this discussion, it is best to look at the artists and               art forms that Lacy and critics cite as influences for her work.               While it would be impossible to show how these aesthetic elements               contributed to social impact without establishing a clearer criteria               for evaluating social impact itself, I will pose ideas about how               the &#8220;artistic&#8221; decisions relate directly to the project&#8217;s               sociopolitical goals.</p>            <p align="center" class="second">**********************</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Whether the art operates as a concrete agent of                 change or functions in the world of symbolism (and how such symbolism                 will affect actual behavior) is a question that must inform a                 more complex critical approach.[36]<br>                ~ Suzanne Lacy </p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">According to Moira Roth, &#8220;image is paramount               in Lacy&#8217;s performances. Her overall design, theme and colors               are always tightly controlled. The visual aspects of her performances               are beautiful in the traditional artistic sense and unify their               diverse elements.&#8221;[37] In all of her collaborative projects,               Suzanne Lacy is concerned with specific formal structures that also               &#8220;affect actual behavior.&#8221; In the case of <em>Roof</em>,               the color and placement of the cars, the symbolic use of road signs,               and the flow of bodies between vehicles were practical as well as               symbolic decisions; like any stage manager or event-planner, Lacy               had to consider how people can move through a space with minimal               chaos. Lacy&#8217;s choice of the rooftop garage as a public venue               was also visually symbolic; it forced audiences to look &#8220;up&#8221;               to teenagers rather than looking down on them. Being on a rooftop               also symbolized the fact that the youth participants were temporarily               detached from, and looking reflectively down upon, the city streets               that represented many of the issues in their lives. </p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/gressel3.jpg" width="300" height="199"></p>            <p class="second">Such decisions also symbolize Lacy&#8217;s desire               to blur distinctions between art and everyday life. This concept               has roots in the happenings and performance art of the 1950s and               60s, associated with, among others, artist and theorist Allan Kaprow.               Lacy describes the relationship of new genre public art to happenings:             </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">The artists [of happenings] appropriated the real                 environment and not the studio, garbage and not fine paints and                 marble. They incorporated technologies that hadn&#8217;t been                 used in art. They incorporated behavior, the weather, ecology,                 and political issues. In short, the dialogue moved from knowing                 more and more about what art was to wondering about what life                 was, the meaning of life.[38]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">As with happenings, the source material for <em>Roof</em>               was &#8220;everyday life&#8221;: the social situation of Oakland&#8217;s               youth and the prevalence of mass media. Using this as the source               material for art could call attention to, and challenge, these social               trends. </p>            <p class="second">A work like <em>Roof</em> is aesthetically similar               to a happening both in its relationship to popular culture and in               its incorporation of simultaneous events or performances (in this               case, the conversations in the different cars). <em>Roof</em> lacked               what Michael Kirby refers to as &#8220;information structure,&#8221;               or &#8220;all the elements needed for the presentation of a cause-and-effect               plot or even the simple sequence of events that would tell a story.&#8221;               [39] Youth were given prompts for their discussions in the cars,               which were also &#8220;rehearsed&#8221; in classroom sessions prior               to the final performance. Yet as in traditional happenings, each               car in <em>Roof</em> also contained what Kirby refers to as &#8220;non-matrixed               performance,&#8221; which rejects the idea of &#8220;an intentionally               created and consciously possessed world&#8221; or invented story               line.[40] As in a happening, the performance itself was not fixed               but came into being as the event progressed. This allowed participants               to have conversations that unfolded organically and related directly               to their lives. It also gave the event&#8217;s audience a window               into the &#8220;real lives&#8221; of teenagers. Lacy was inspired               to infuse a social dimension into the framework of the happening               by early feminist artists, such as Judy Chicago, who gathered the               source material for their unscripted events not only from &#8220;everyday               life&#8221; but from prevailing political issues. Chicago&#8217;s               <em>Womanhouse</em> (1971) invited different women to create individual               rooms of a house that each expressed an issue relating to women&#8217;s               confinement in the home. </p>            <p class="second">Lacy&#8217;s aesthetic of nonmatrixed performance               gave the participants&#8217; narratives a credibility they might               otherwise lack. In order to allow many conversations to take place               at one time in <em>Roof</em>, she also drew from the &#8220;compartmentalized               structure&#8221; found in happenings, &#8220;based on the arrangement               and contiguity of theatrical units that are completely self-contained               and hermetic. No information is passed from one discrete theatrical               unit&#8212;or &#8216;compartment&#8217; to another.&#8221;[41] Each               car on the rooftop can be considered a &#8220;self-contained&#8221;               compartment. The compartmentalized structure enables complex conversations               to exist within a larger symbolic visual frame, and has been used               in many of Lacy&#8217;s other projects. Her 1985-1987 <em>Crystal               Quilt</em>, for example, featured simultaneous conversations between               elderly women sitting at tables. Arranged by Miriam Shapiro, the               tables together created a patchwork quilt pattern, a tribute to               collaborative women&#8217;s work. This was intended to help the               women and outside viewers perceive the individual conversations               as part of a larger feminist movement. The organizers of <em>Roof</em>               hoped that youth participants would feel ownership over their individual               conversations while also considering how these conversations related               to a greater social framework. The goal of the TEAM projects was               largely to, as Kester aptly states, encourage people normally pitted               against one another, such as youth from different neighborhoods,               or youth and police officers, to perceive each other &#8220;not               as abstractions, but as specific individuals.&#8221;[42] One of               the challenges for collaborative artists is designing projects that               empower individual participants to tell their stories, yet still               contain powerful, unifying narratives or visual statements. Within               a less lucid formal framework, the stories of specific individuals               in <em>Roof</em> might have been lost, if not to the participants               then to the audience attending the event.</p>            <table width="469" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">              <tr>                 <td width="1">&nbsp;</td>                <td width="250"><img src="images/gressel4.jpg" width="250" height="191"></td>                <td width="15">&nbsp;</td>                <td width="203">Suzanne Lacy,<em> The Crystal Quilt</em>, 1985-87</td>              </tr>            </table>            <p class="second">Their status as physical components of a work of               visual art, or &#8220;living painting,&#8221; may also have helped               participants engage freely in dialogue. Jennifer Fisher has compared               Lacy&#8217;s work to the <em>tableaux vivant</em> of the nineteenth               century, in which human participants staged scenes from paintings               or sculptures. Fisher discusses how in contemporary performance               art, methods of <em>tableaux vivant</em> are used to create &#8220;zones               of interperformance by which the terrain of fixed representation               is transformed.&#8221; These tableaux contain what Fisher calls               the &#8220;aesthetics of becoming,&#8221; or the imitative learning               of social traits through mime and performance. In the nineteenth               century <em>tableaux vivant</em>, Victorian women staged conventions               of social etiquette. These living pictures at the turn of the century               evolved into public performances and street theater in which immigrants               were &#8220;socialized&#8221; in acts of &#8220;individual and collective               social transformation.&#8221;[43] Fisher compares these <em>tableaux               vivant</em> to Lacy&#8217;s staged feminist performances which &#8220;[addressed]               the &#8216;absence&#8217; of women through the framing of situations               that assert their &#8216;presence.&#8217;&#8221; These performances               &#8220;frame situations and shape connective activity to effect               what she has called &#8216;sculptures in dialogue.&#8217;&#8221;[44]</p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/gressel5.jpg" width="300" height="201"></p>            <p class="second">In <em>Roof</em>, &#8220;tableaux&#8221; of teenagers               in cars created a means by which young people could practice being               heard in a large-scale venue, in effect, &#8220;performing&#8221;               the customs of speaking about the issues that mattered to them.               This was meant to promote &#8220;individual and collective social               transformation.&#8221; Speaking as part of a visual tableau was               perhaps considered less threatening for participants than speaking               at a traditional forum on youth issues that did not have the symbolic               detachment of a &#8220;work of art.&#8221; Rather than participating               in a series of dialogues confined to a classroom, or even a series               of educational videos, the participants in <em>Roof</em> were part               of a large and highly visible live statement whose symbolism borrowed               directly from a youth culture associated with consumerism, street               life, and peer relationships (all symbolized by groups of young               people in cars). This situation asserted the &#8220;presence&#8221;               of individual adolescents in a society accustomed to dismissing               or stereotyping them, and asserted their ability to function as               a self-contained community (or living tableau) which they themselves               had created and produced independently of mainstream media. </p>            <p class="second">The relationship of the project&#8217;s visual symbolism               to popular culture also may have contributed to its ability to engage               youth. In her review of Lacy&#8217;s 1999 TEAM performance between               youth and police officers, <em>Code 33: Clear the Air</em>, Megan               Wilson discusses its &#8220;theatrical display with its incredibly               detailed and contrived choreography&#8212;the roles, the uniforms,               the colors, the music, the helicopter, the synchronized dance&#8230;&#8221;               she also describes a poster advertising the event that referenced               MTV, comparing the event to &#8220;an early prototype for the current               reality show craze.&#8221; Wilson asks, </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Under what other guise would it be possible to                 gain the trust of so many youth and convince them to participate                 in a series of discussions with their perceived (and often real)                 enemy? Could the debates have reached the same level of candidness                 without the slick performative apparatus? Would an event of the                 same nature organized at the YMCA, held in a gymnasium with folded                 chairs and everyone in plain clothes, have generated the degree                 of community interest and media coverage that &#8220;Code 33&#8221;                 did? Finally, why shouldn&#8217;t the conflict resolution process                 also be fun?[45]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Wilson&#8217;s assessment implies that Lacy&#8217;s               youth&#8211;oriented performances contain elements of pageantry,               hype, and pop-cultural symbolism that help attract both participants               and audiences, especially if they perceive themselves as actors               in a television show rather than the players in a high-stakes real               life scenario. <em>The Roof is on Fire</em> was more modest than               some of Lacy&#8217;s later TEAM performances like <em>Code 33</em>,               which featured costumed dance performances. Yet it established the               tradition of borrowing from conventions of popular sensational news               broadcasts and sound bites, as well as the materialism associated               with contemporary youth culture (colorful cars, fancy AV equipment               and posters, and directional road signs, a product of the artists&#8217;               trip to Oakland&#8217;s sign factory, lent the modest rooftop garage               a kitsch reference to the American road trip). In <em>Conversation               Pieces</em>, Grant Kester rejects evaluating collaborative artworks               by a &#8220;formal, pleasure-based methodology that cannot value,               or even recognize, the communicative interactions that these artists               find so important&#8230;because the critic gains no sensory stimulation               or fails to find the work visually engaging, it is dismissed as               failed art.&#8221;[46] Wilson, Fisher, and Roth, however, clearly               see the &#8220;sensory stimulation&#8221; in Lacy&#8217;s work as               essential to engaging youth participants, attracting viewers, and               ensuring that the audience fully grasps the connection between the               project and the conventions it aims to challenge. </p>            <p class="second">While incorporating imagery and content from everyday               life, the symbolic and aesthetic frame of <em>Roof</em> provided               a space where participants and audiences could &#8220;see&#8221;               and experience relevant issues in a new way. It disrupted people&#8217;s               day to day lives to pinpoint the specific experiences of young people,               and zoom in on the ability of these young people to address their               own problems through dialogue and creative action. This tradition               of altering the conventions of mass media and popular culture through               imagery and performance can be seen in the work of artists and collectives               like Barbara Kruger or the Adbusters Media Foundation. These artists               appropriate and alter mass media forms to subvert their pervasive               messages. <em>Roof</em> restructured a scene typically used to depict               youth negatively (teenagers hanging out in cars or on street corners,               up to no good). This symbolism was heightened by the coincidental               juxtaposition between <em>Roof</em>&#8217;s performance and the               especially chilling scene of teenagers on the evening news days               before. An even more striking example of the use of altered media               objects within the <em>Roof</em> project were the posters that advertised               the event, including billboards erected along major freeways, which               contained some of the same prompts used to start the teenagers&#8217;               conversations in the cars. These billboards were intended to spark               a dialogue about the themes of <em>Roof</em> prior to its actual               performance and provide alternative messages in the urban environment               from consumerist advertisements. </p>            <p align="center" class="second"><img src="images/gressel6.jpg" width="300" height="199"></p>            <p class="second">The resulting documentary video about the event               can also be viewed as an art object that employed formal documentary               film techniques to both highlight the individual stories of youth,               and provide a lasting alternative narrative to typical news broadcasts.               It can still be used to disseminate both the content and methods               of the <em>Roof</em> project to future audiences and educators,               along with the curricular materials used in the teen workshops.               This tangible documentation of the project allowed <em>Roof</em>               to continue to serve as a teaching tool and undoubtedly help spark               the other TEAM collaborations that followed. I have already mentioned               the video created through the subsequent TEAM project, <em>Youth,               Cops, and Videotape</em> that was later used in police training.               We cannot underemphasize the practical importance of the multiple               visual objects produced through these projects in aiding the educational               and institutional exchanges that took place. </p>            <p align="center" class="second">**********************</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Suzanne Lacy is one of the few performance artists                 who has been able to get off the stage and into the streets without                 sacrificing her experimental integrity and striking imagery.[47]<br>                ~ Lucy R. Lippard </p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">While it is important to assess a project like <em>The               Roof is on Fire</em> in terms of the quality of exchange between               its participants and its relationship to a larger social context,               it is also valuable to recognize the aesthetic or artistic elements               of the piece and how they helped create the conditions in which               these relationships could take place. In contrast to the dialogical               aesthetic he proposes, Grant Kester describes how, </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">beginning in the early 20th century the consensus                 among advanced artists and critics was that, far from communicating                 with viewers, the avant-garde work of art should radically challenge                 their faith in the very possibility of rational discourse&#8230;Art&#8217;s                 role is to shock us out of this perceptual complacency, to force                 us to see the world anew&#8230;in each case the result is a kind                 of epiphany that lifts viewers outside the familiar boundaries                 of common language, existing modes of representation, and even                 their own sense of self.[48]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"><em>Roof</em> was successful largely because of               its potential to create such epiphany, for both the viewers of the               event and its documentary and the participants who were lifted out               of their normal &#8220;sense of self.&#8221; Kester describes how               in a work such as <em>Roof</em>, such an attitude shift occurs through               social exchanges rather than physical stimuli. Kester associates               more sensory aesthetic experience with disinterested isolation rather               than the consensus building so important to achieving the social               impact of dialogical public art. Yet it is important to consider               the many ways in which <em>Roof</em>&#8217;s organizers used sensory               experiences to initially inspire people to take part in the dialogues               or even listen: the billboards and posters, the spectacle of elaborately               placed cars and teenagers milling around a rooftop, even the soundtrack               of the documentary. Kester is correct in recognizing the importance               of the ongoing, gradual process of transformation in dialogical               art but the importance of epiphany in sparking the dialogues cannot               be overlooked. Similarly, a powerful visual art object or performance               may initially strike a viewer and inspire a more prolonged thought               process. This sustained &#8220;dialogue&#8221; with a work of art               or an artist usually occurs because of the presence of nuances and               contradictions rather than consensus. As Claire Bishop describes,</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">discomfort and frustration-along with absurdity,                 eccentricity, doubt, or sheer pleasure-can&#8230;be crucial elements                 of a work's aesthetic impact and are essential to gaining new                 perspectives on social conditions. The best examples of socially                 collaborative art give rise to these-and many other-effects, which                 must be read alongside more legible intentions, such as the recovery                 of a phantasmic social bond or the sacrifice of authorship in                 the name of a &quot;true&quot; and respectful collaboration.[49]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Bishop&#8217;s aesthetic criteria for socially-engaged               art is an aesthetic of both epiphany and complexity. Lacy&#8217;s               work operates on deeper levels than the shock value of large-scale               &#8220;interventions&#8221; in urban life or the alteration of mass               media; she is able to incorporate multiple narratives into a work               like <em>Roof</em> without sacrificing its overall symbolic impact.               The unusual juxtaposition of a municipal rooftop garage and teenagers               in cars, the harsh content of some of their life stories, and the               provocative nature of some the ads for the event may have been shocking,               but they held together in a more harmonious image. More importantly,               to this day they symbolize the fact that the participating youth               were able to come together as a self-contained community to realize               the project. Lacy has found a way to incorporate long-term exploration               of social issues, including disagreement and debate, into projects               that retain their aesthetic integrity and symbolize, as well as               allow, the empowerment of the participants who create them. Perhaps               this is why Lacy herself says,</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">In spite of the political uses to which notions                 of invention are put, a very real sense of beauty&#8212;the ahhah                 experience&#8212;results from reassembling meaning in a way that,                 at that moment, appears new and unique to the perceiver. This                 paradox must be grappled with in new genre public art: the desire                 for what has not been seen and the politically isolating demand                 for originality. The perception of beauty, subject as it is to                 cultural training and political manipulation, is still a necessary                 aspect of human existence. The quality of imagery and use of materials,                 including time and interaction, must be included in critical analysis                 of new genre public art.[50]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">While it may be presumptuous to assume that one               work of socially-engaged, collaborative public art can radically               change prevailing cultural attitudes or the lives of a large number               of participants, it can add to an archive of ideas about how art               can respond to and challenge a sociopolitical problem, and how artists               can overcome traditional notions of cultural object, producer, and               audience to create thought-provoking new art forms. It may be best               to consider <em>The Roof is on Fire</em> mainly in terms of its               impact on the field of public art. According to Jacoby, in terms               of both its social content and methodology, <em>The Roof is on Fire</em>               was very much a product of its time, designed to give youth a voice               in the mass media when the definition of &#8220;mass media&#8221;               did not yet include the &#8220;more democratic and accessible Internet.&#8221;[51]               Yet <em>Roof</em> can continue to serve as an example of how collaborative               artists can design projects that operate on multiple levels (engaging               participants, contemporary audiences, and future audiences) and               incorporate more traditional definitions of &#8220;art&#8221; and               aesthetic and sensory stimulation in order to do so. In the words               of Suzanne Lacy, this type of new genre public art &#8220;might               be a model for artists themselves, stretching the boundaries, incorporating               new forms, [and] giving permission for invention.&#8221;[52]</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Katherine Gressel</strong> graduated from               Yale in 2003 with a B.A. in painting, and has a strong interest               in community-based public art.
