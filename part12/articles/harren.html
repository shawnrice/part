On one hand, the rapid construction of new and expanded arts               institutions and a greater dedication to community-focused programming               stresses the importance of locatedness and regionalism. Meanwhile,               metropoli worldwide are scrambling to enter the international biennial               and triennial circuit, and major museums are adding temporary installation               series to their exhibition programs. The latter's proponents talk               excitedly about collaboration, nomadism and international dialogue.               On the vanguard of this movement is Utopia Station, a multifaceted               project of curators Hans-Ulrich Obrist and Molly Nesbit and artist               Rirkrit Tiravanija, which attempts to reinvigorate utopia as a conceptual               impetus for forward-looking collaboration. It has been the organizing               principle of numerous exhibitions, symposia, and performances. Similar               to the political formation of the multitude, as theorized by Antonio               Negri and Michael Hardt, all Utopia Station&#8217;s projects strive               to orient individuals of varying perspectives toward collective               action. One of its earliest manifestations was <em>Utopia Station</em>,               an exhibition included in the 2003 Venice Biennale. Its critical               reception was dismal. Critics called the show a &#8220;directionless               sprawl,&#8221; a &#8220;confusing cornucopia,&#8221; &#8220;particularly               pretentious,&#8221; and &#8220;fatally separate.&#8221; After an               extravagant three-day opening celebration, to later visitors <em>Utopia               Station</em> was less an exhibition than the garbage-strewn scene               of yesterday&#8217;s party. Despite its good intentions, <em>Utopia               Station</em> did not inspire genuine interaction. It manufactured               the multitude. </p>            <p class="second">The fiftieth anniversary of the Biennale di Venezia               in 2003 marked a rupture in the fair&#8217;s 100-year history. Rather               than formulating in the Arsenale, the Biennale's central exhibition               space, a singular diagnosis of the current field of visual arts               (a strategy trademarked by twice-Biennale curator Harald Szeemann),               elected curator Francesco Bonami invited eleven others to organize               separate shows in the mile-long stretch of gallery space. The result               was a succession of intense, cacophonous installations of widely               varying scope that, as one traversed the building&#8217;s length,               took viewers on an overwhelming and disorienting ride. Assuming               one had enough energy to reach the end of the gargantuan presentation,               she would happen upon <em>Utopia Station</em>, the joint curatorial               project of Obrist, Nesbit, and Tiravanija.</p>            <p class="second"><em>Utopia Station</em> occupied the final room               of the Arsenale and spilled out onto an adjoining lawn. A number               of plywood constructions occupied the interior space. Circular benches               and tables designed by Liam Gillick sat before a stage-like platform               equipped with a public address system. The stage was connected to               a larger plywood structure that marked out a series of roofless               rooms with doors, each devoted to a small installation or video.               <a href="http://www.universes-in-universe.de/car/venezia/bien50/foto-tour/img/tour-6-1.jpg" class="link_underline">Outside</a>,               several independent, architectural constructions dotted the haggard               turf. Over 150 artists designed small posters on the topic of utopia,               and these were pasted throughout the entire space&#8212;within,               on, and throughout the individual projects on display. <em>Utopia               Station</em> was a scene of both organized and spontaneous performances,               lectures, panel discussions, workshops, and film screenings. The               exhibition&#8217;s haphazard organization and absence of interpretive               literature, in combination with the amorphousness of many of the               artworks, made the correct authorial identification of most displays               impossible. It offered widely varying experiences to viewers depending               on the time of their visit and was, at different times, a space               for discussion, argumentation, relaxation, refreshment, meditation,               and celebration. </p>            <p class="second">The sprawling spatiotemporal presentation of <em>Utopia               Station</em> makes it difficult to describe, but Obrist, Nesbit               and Tiravanija&#8217;s curatorial statement provides the conceptual               framework that aspires to bring the entire project together.[1]               They describe <em>Utopia Station</em> as a &#8220;way-station,&#8221;               a &#8220;flexible&#8221; &#8220;conceptual structure&#8221; that               &#8220;doesn&#8217;t present itself as a finished picture.&#8221;[2]               It is &#8220;a place to stop, to contemplate, to listen and see,               to rest and refresh, to talk and exchange.&#8221;[3] It is &#8220;completed               by the presence of people and a program of events. Performances,               concerts, lectures, readings, film programs, parties, the events               will multiply. They define the Station as much as its solid objects               do.&#8221;[4] Furthermore, Obrist, Nesbit and Tiravanija conceived               of <em>Utopia Station</em> as one amongst many Utopia Stations.[5]               The project lives beyond the 2003 Biennale, extending before it               in time as meetings in Paris, Venice, Frankfurt, Poughkeepsie, and               Berlin, and after it as various gatherings and exhibitions led by               any or all of the three curators, in Munich and Sindelfingen, Germany,               Porto Alegre, Brazil, and New Jersey, as recently as March 2006.</p>            <p class="second"> The Venice exhibition curatorial statement is the               first published declaration of the <em>Utopia Station</em> project               as a whole, and in it the authors declare, &#8220;There is no hierarchy               of importance between the gatherings, meetings, seminars, exhibitions               and books; all of them become equally good ways of working.&#8221;[6]               <em>Utopia Station</em> provides a conceptual framework for organizing               a series of separate but linked projects, all situated in the visual               arts but which are becoming, contra the scrambled message of <em>Utopia               Station</em>, overtly political.[7] Between October 7, 2004 and               January 16, 2005, <em>Utopia Station</em> appeared as a series of               gatherings at the Haus der Kunst in Munich, and the program included               a lecture by Antonio Negri, co-author of <em>Empire</em>. The Munich               program also included a press conference with Yoko Ono, a seminar               by Martha Rosler, a discussion between Obrist, Nesbit and Tiravanija,               lectures by Bruce Sterling and Edouard Glissant, and an open mic               with Steve McQueen, Philippe Parreno, Anton Vidokle, Yona Friedman               and Carsten H&ouml;ller, among others. Shortly thereafter, <em>Utopia               Station</em> emerged as a platform for discussion at the World Social               Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Utopia Station</em> has amounted to a project               much more vast and unruly than the already-overwhelming Venice exhibition               because it was designed to be so. The curators&#8217; declaration               of <em>Utopia Station</em> poses the concept not as a finished statement,               but as a mode of working inspired by utopia. They write:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">We use utopia as a catalyst, a concept so much                 useful as fuel. We leave the complete definition of utopia to                 others. We meet to pool our efforts, motivated by a need to change                 the landscape outside and inside, a need to think, a need to integrate                 the work of the artist, the intellectual and manual laborers that                 we are into a larger kind of community, another kind of economy,                 a bigger conversation, another state of being.[8]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">This statement encapsulates two crucial characteristics               of <em>Utopia Station</em> as a general project. First, it redefines               &#8220;utopia&#8221; as a process rather than as a place, so that               utopia now refers to utopic thinking in the present rather than               to a space that is separate from here, is somewhere else, or is               &#8220;over there.&#8221; Second, its success requires the collaboration               of diverse individuals working cooperatively toward a shared goal.             </p>            <p class="second">This second condition rings eerily similar to a               concept of political organization preceding <em>Utopia Station</em>,               which has undoubtedly influenced its formation&#8212;Antonio Negri               and Michael Hardt&#8217;s idea of the multitude.[9] Though not stated               explicitly by its curators, <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s foundation               rests on Hardt and Negri&#8217;s theorization of the multitude because               the exhibition relies on the concept's ability to reconcile the               singular with the collective. But, conversely, <em>Utopia Station</em>               has something to lend to <em>Empire</em>. Obrist, Nesbit and Tiravanija               use a multiplicious production strategy to reinvigorate the idea               of utopia, which Hardt and Negri, in their immanent fever, have               cast aside. Each project illuminates, complements and bolsters the               other, sending light to unexplored corners and pushing the other               forward to those places where it has not been able to go. The multitude               and utopia, it turns out, travel hand in hand toward these new horizons.</p>            <p class="second"> In their watershed text <em>Empire</em>, Hardt               and Negri introduce a political formation they call &#8220;the multitude,&#8221;               a postmodern revision of the proletariat that respects the singularity               of subjects working collectively. The importance of the multitude,               the authors insist, is that it is the only political formation capable               of launching a counter-Empire. In their subsequent work <em>Multitude:               War and Democracy in the Age of Empire</em>, Hardt and Negri fully               explicate the genealogy, role, and potential of the multitude within               Empire.[10] In a particularly exuberant passage, the logic of the               multitude is aligned with Mikhail Bakhtin&#8217;s notion of carnevalesque               narration, which, through dialogue or &#8220;polyphony,&#8221; creates               narrative through the interaction of many subjects.[11] In carnevalesque               narration there is no central referent of meaning; rather, meaning               is created out of free, spontaneous and collective exchange between               individual subjects. Hardt and Negri liken contemporary forms of               protest to Bakhtin&#8217;s carnevalesque to show how the multitude               can embody the conflicting ideals of singularity and collectivity:               structurally, in that protests are based on a decentralized network               structure of different groups working collaboratively, and representationally,               in their use of dance, song, puppetry, etc. Here is Hardt and Negri&#8217;s               dramatic conclusion:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> Today&#8217;s new and powerful movements seem                 to elude any attempt to reduce them to a monologic history; they                 cannot but be carnevalesque. This is the logic of the multitude                 that Bakhtin helps us understand: a theory of organization based                 on the freedom of singularities that converge in the production                 of the common. Long live movement! Long live carnival! Long live                 the common![12]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The polyphonic logic of carnevalesque narration               is also that of the multitude.</p>            <p class="second"> The secondary importance of the carnevalesque is               that it provides an avenue to utopistic thinking about the construction               of new worlds, which is the desire of the multitude.[13] Recalling               Obrist, Nesbit, and Tiravanija&#8217;s statements on <em>Utopia               Station</em>, then, the carnevalesque would also be the logic that               brings together participants in their project. The multitude, &#8220;a               theory of organization based on the freedom of singularities that               converge in the production of the common,&#8221; could be, more               specifically, &#8220;a theory of organization based on the freedom               of singularities that converge in the production&#8221; of <em>Utopia               Station</em>. <em>Utopia Station</em>, as a nebulous, continuously               evolving project, would not be possible without the conceptualization               of subjectivity offered by the multitude. Yet, while the curators               of <em>Utopia Station</em> proposed the exhibition as a space for               and by the multitude, it is a false representation of the multitude.               In the spirit of carnival, the curators conceptually foreground               interpersonal exchange to the display of objects, but in reality               the exhibition must still rely on conventions of visual display.               After an ecstatic opening program of events, the festival exhausts               itself. The artworks-turned-props can only suggest actions and interactions               that are no longer spontaneous but forced, at best. <em>Utopia Station</em>               merely manufactures the multitude.</p>            <p class="second"> Before further drawing out the relationship between               <em>Utopia Station</em> and Hardt and Negri&#8217;s multitude, it               is important to understand first the concept of the multitude. Hardt               and Negri introduce it in their text <em>Empire</em>, which argues               the existence of a recent global shift from modern sovereignty,               based on the nation-state, to imperial sovereignty, or Empire, wherein               supranational powers unite under the singular logic of capitalism.               This shift is caused by the gradual re-investment in immanent rather               than transcendent forms of knowledge and power that began with the               European Renaissance. Hardt and Negri trace the discovery of this               &#8220;plane of immanence&#8221; through the thought of Dante Alighieri,               Francis Bacon, and Benedictus de Spinoza. Rather than being invested               in the church, the crown, or even the People (for Hardt and Negri               also a transcendent concept), imperial power is deterritorialized,               decentralized, and distributed across a network rather than invested               in the church or crown. In its immanency, imperial sovereignty erases               the division between inside and outside; thus, any effort at resisting               Empire must be made from within it. This leaves the multitude as               the only political formation capable of raising a counter-Empire.</p>            <p class="second"> Hardt and Negri locate the origin of this notion               of the multitude in Spinoza&#8217;s Ethics, wherein he presents               democracy as the only form of government proper to knowledge couched               in the plane of immanence because democracy is ruled by the multitude,               which satisfies desires for both individual and collective political               representation.[14] This is the key for Hardt and Negri&#8212;that               the multitude respects differences as it collectivizes. It is unlike               the notion of the People, which, although embraced by contemporary               democracies, is tied to monarchical systems and social purification               programs, and maintains the integrity of the nation-state. The People               is a concept that unifies and homogenizes the identities of a diverse               population. The multitude, conversely, is &#8220;a multiplicity,               a plane of singularities, an open set of relations&#8230;&#8221;[15]               It is &#8220;an open network of singularities that links together               on the basis of the common they share and the common they produce.&#8221;[16]               The multitude is not united by identity but by its collective production,               and it is an inclusive constituency. It occupies the void between               the People and the individual, adopting the virtues of both. </p>            <p class="second">In <em>Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of               Empire</em>, Hardt and Negri&#8217;s follow-up to <em>Empire</em>,               they utilize two conceptualizations of the multitude. The first               is the multitude <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em>, the always-already,               ontological multitude without which we could never have imagined               the possibility of refusing authority.[17] The second is the potential,               historical, not-yet multitude that lays in wait for a political               project to bring it into existence. It is pure potential. The authors               stress that these two conceptions are not separable, for &#8220;if               the multitude were not already latent and implicit in our social               being, we could not even imagine it as a political project; and,               similarly, we can only hope to realize it today because it already               exists as a real potential.&#8221;[18] This doubled articulation               of the multitude was already latent in Spinoza&#8217;s thought,               being that the multitude signified an &#8220;absolute democratic               power&#8221; at the same time that it already possessed the tools               for political revolution.[19]</p>            <p class="second">Under imperial sovereignty, these tools are not               limited to those of the industrial worker. Hardt and Negri place               so much emphasis on the multitude because it is seen as a necessary               postmodern rearticulation of the terms of class politics. The proletariat,               associated with a dialogical power structure, industrial labor,               and modern (transcendent) sovereignty, is subsumed under the multitude,               an expanded term that claims a generalized proletarianization of               labor, so that &#8220;labor&#8221; can include newer, immaterial               forms (service, communication, management, etc.). Membership is               open to all laborers; it is guaranteed, but optional. </p>            <p class="second">The multitude is empowered by its &#8220;will to               be-against,&#8221; which becomes all the more significant in Empire,               where there is no outside.[20] &#8220;If there is no longer a place               that can be recognized as outside,&#8221; Hardt and Negri write,               &#8220;we must be against in every place.&#8221;[21] And the way               the multitude does this is through nomadism, desertion, and exodus,               which, rather than modern forms of dialectically positioned sabotage,               take an &#8220;oblique or diagonal stance&#8221; in order to &#8220;push               through Empire to come out on the other side.&#8221;[22] This suggests               that the multitude must work within and throughout Empire in its               production of a counter-Empire. It must be mobile and based on a               network structure, i.e. immanent, just as power and knowledge have               become. </p>            <p class="second">These charges are shared by <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s               triumphant curatorial statement, which introduces the show not as               a representation of utopia-as-plan, but as a field of dialogue containing               a plethora of incommensurable viewpoints all groping toward utopia.               The curators recount various responses artists gave to the idea               of utopia: &#8220;Liam Gillick asked us to avoid utopian mirage,               instead asking for utopia to become a functional step moving beyond               itself&#8230;Jonas Mekas warned of obsessions with ideas, since               the dream, he said, could only succeed if we forget them&#8230;Nancy               Spero sent a morphine dream. Agnes Varda sent us the song of the               Cadet Rousselle.&#8221;[23] These ideas are not for the curators               to evaluate, but to bring together in conversation. The participating               artists represent not utopia but a multitude working toward utopia.</p>            <p class="second">Structurally, like the multitude, <em>Utopia Station</em>               was a network of its own. The artworks on display were often self-regenerating,               rhizomatic projects. <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/people/robinson/Images/robinson6-16-39.jpg" class="link_underline">Yoko               Ono</a> invited visitors to stamp the words &#8220;imagine peace&#8221;               onto a map of the Middle East. A layer of ink built up so thickly               around war-torn areas that place-names became illegible, but the               words &#8220;imagine peace&#8221; were also to be seen on the map&#8217;s               edges, on the surrounding plywood walls, in other rooms, and on               visitors&#8217; skin, to be displayed wherever they decided to wander.               <a href="http://www.superflex.net/tools/supercopy/pics/guaranapowerinst.jpg" class="link_underline">Superflex</a>               distributed bottles of GUARAN&Aacute; POWER, a drink they helped               Brazilian farmers to produce, which quickly became empty containers               littered over the outdoor lawn, the Arsenale and much of southeastern               Venice. German artist Christoph Schlingensief constructed a creepishly               quaint <a href="http://www.church-of-fear.net/pics/bildergalerie/church_2.jpg" class="link_underline">outdoor               chapel</a> for his <em>Church of Fear (COF)</em>, a parodic religion               seeking to cultivate fear in its followers. Viewers were invited               to establish their own COF congregation at home. Hundreds of posters               designed for <em>Utopia Station</em> were pasted throughout the               exhibition, but they also appeared elsewhere in Venice and on the               Internet, where one could freely download, print, and post them               anywhere.[24] The limitless possibility of expansion for many of               <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s artworks relied on participation               from viewers, who, in bringing the works to life, added to the carnevalesque               narrative on utopia taking place.</p>            <p class="second"><em>Utopia Station</em> is one node in a network               of events called Utopia Station; another parallel of the multitude&#8217;s               network structure. Obrist has said, &#8220;After an initial appearance               at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003, the Station has developed into               a kind of an evolving system. From being a very horizontal concept               in Venice, it was transformed into occupying a &#8216;receptive&#8217;               zone, which can at any point be animated.&#8221;[25] <em>Utopia               Station</em> has morphed through various incarnations as web site,               exhibition, lecture series, performance program, or whatever other               form its curators might envision, and it has appeared in various               places at various times throughout the world. Obrist&#8217;s phrase               &#8220;receptive zone&#8221; parrots the form of Empire, which Hardt               and Negri have called &#8220;a superficial world, the virtual center               of which can be accessed immediately from any point across the surface.&#8221;[26]               If imperial sovereignty functions as a network, so must the multitude,               and with it, <em>Utopia Station</em>. In this light, <em>Utopia               Station</em> assumes the shade of a fiercely political project,               one that attempts to mobilize the multitude against Empire within               a visual arts context. Remember the words of its organizers: </p>            <blockquote>              <p class="second">We meet to pool our efforts, motivated by a need                 to change the landscape outside and inside, a need to think, a                 need to integrate the work of the artist, the intellectual and                 manual laborers that we are into a larger kind of community, another                 kind of economy, a bigger conversation, another state of being.[27]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Regardless of whether or not <em>Utopia Station</em>               achieved its goal of creating &#8220;another state of being,&#8221;               we can see that this turn of phrase is really the multitude in disguise.               The exhibition was never really about accessing utopia, or as <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/projects/utopia/art/004baldessari/2.jpg" class="link_underline">John               Baldessari&#8217;s contribution</a> to the poster might suggest,               bringing the &#8220;there&#8221; over &#8220;here.&#8221; Rather,               <em>Utopia Station</em> was clearly attempting to mobilize, or at               the very least to represent, the multitude.</p>            <p class="second">The somewhat awkward equivalence I am trying to               pose between the multitude and <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s collective               imagining of utopia points to the fundamental incongruence between               the understandings of utopia held by the authors of <em>Empire</em>               and <em>Utopia Station</em>. Can a political formation mirror utopia,               that which is literally a non-place? It is possible because Obrist,               Nesbit and Tiravanija redefine utopia in terms of imperial sovereignty.               Instead of an &#8220;over there,&#8221; it becomes a <em>working-toward</em>               the &#8220;over there.&#8221; They situate utopia in the plane of               immanence, changing its significance from noun to verb, a concept               to work with rather than a place of which we dream but can never               reach. Meanwhile, Hardt and Negri have netted all transcendent forms               of knowledge and politics in the plane of immanence but leave the               island of Utopia still floating just beyond reach. When Hardt and               Negri mention utopia in <em>Empire</em>, it is in opposition to               multitude. They invoke Spinoza to suggest that the multitude is               already equipped with the tools it needs to form a counter-Empire,               but they detach this revolutionary potential from utopian thinking:               &#8220;[A]ny postmodern liberation must be achieved within this               world, on the plane of immanence, with no possibility of any even               utopian outside.&#8221;[28] Their definition of utopia assumes a               modernist dialectical structure of inside/outside, wherein utopia               is always a place that is &#8220;not here.&#8221; Such a utopia               belongs to the tradition of Thomas B. More, who in 1516 invented               the name to describe an island society so ridiculously perfect that               many readers thought his account to be non-fiction. </p>            <p class="second">More&#8217;s utopia is invested in modern sovereignty               on two accounts. First, the citizens of Utopia are united by their               belief in a transcendent power known as Mithra. More writes:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> They believe there is one divinity, which is                 unknown, eternal, unmeasurable, inexplicable, beyond the capacity                 of man&#8217;s understanding, and present through the universe,                 though not as a physical body, but rather through its influence.[29]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">There could perhaps be no better definition of transcendence               than this. The Utopians&#8217; belief in Mithra is what unites them               as a People under the flag of Utopia, a model of citizenship that               answers to the conditions of outdated modern sovereignty. Secondly,               Utopia itself is transcendent. It is ontologically a place outside               of reality; utopia is alive to us only in our dreams and plans.               This is a concept that the plane of immanence rejects. Calling for               a counter-Empire political discourse, Hardt and Negri write, &#8220;There               is not finally here any determinism or utopia: it is rather a radical               counterpower, ontologically grounded not on any &#8216;vide pour               la future&#8217; but on the actual activity of the multitude, its               creation, production, and power&#8212;a materialist teleology.&#8221;[30]               If the multitude is imbued with power in its immanency, if it represents               a materialist teleology, then for it, utopia as a strategy cannot               maintain. Hardt and Negri do not revive utopia because, for them,               it is associated with the power structure they oppose. </p>            <p class="second">Obrist, Nesbit and Tiravanija recognize that utopia               has lost currency in contemporary political and cultural discourse,               but they adopt the term anyhow. Their statement admits, &#8220;The               work done in the name of utopia has soured the concept, left it               strangled by internal, seemingly fixed perspectives, the skeletons               of old efforts which leave their bones on the surface of the body               as if they lived there.&#8221;[31] In a radical gesture, they turn               their attention to a concept deemed frivolous and irrelevant to               production under imperial sovereignty and refashion it in immanent               terms. &#8220;We use utopia as a catalyst,&#8221; they write, &#8220;a               concept so much useful as fuel.&#8221;[32] Beginning with <em>Utopia               Station</em> in 2003, they have gradually coaxed utopia back into               cultural debates. In 2005, they brought their platform to World               Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where over 150,000 people               comprising thousands of diverse civil groups converged under the               slogan &#8220;another world is possible.&#8221; If the multitude               wants to claim that another world is possible, don't we still need               utopia to imagine what this other world might be? Yes, but it must               be refashioned for the plane of immanence because it has been trumped               by Empire. &#8220;[T]he clearly defined crisis of modernity gives               way to an omni-crisis in the imperial world,&#8221; Hardt and Negri               write. &#8220;In this smooth space of Empire, there is no <em>place</em>               of power&#8212;it is both everywhere and nowhere. Empire is an <em>ou-topia</em>,               or really a <em>non-place</em>.&#8221;[33] The repositioning of               utopia, fundamental to Obrist, Nesbit and Tiravanija&#8217;s project,               is able to reconnect it intimately to the activity of the multitude               and the creation of a counter-Empire that, like Empire, must operate               in the non-place of immanent power.</p>            <p class="second">What rescues utopia from rhetorical purgatory is               the term &#8220;station.&#8221; When the curators asked him about               utopia, Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami &#8220;refused the long               perspectives of utopia altogether. He preferred to fix matters in               the present, taking each day one hill at a time.&#8221;[34] Kiarostami&#8217;s               take is Hardt and Negri&#8217;s, that the island of Utopia is a               stale fantasy, archaic in the face of Empire. The curatorial team               compromises: &#8220;We in turn have set our sights on the middle               ground between the island and the hill. We will build a station               there and name it utopia station.&#8221;[35] Utopia as station becomes               a way of connecting production for the present to production for               a desired future. <em>Utopia Station</em> is about working with               Utopia in mind, not producing the thing itself. It is an inspired               process. </p>            <p class="second">This place between the hill and the island is much               like another pairing of Hardt and Negri&#8217;s: the virtual and               the real. These two terms can be linked by the possible, i.e. production,               but are held forcibly apart by imperial powers. &#8220;Living labor               is what constructs the passageway from the virtual to the real;               it is the vehicle of possibility,&#8221; Hardt and Negri write.[36]               And of course it is the multitude that is charged with building               this passage. <em>Utopia Station</em> is not possible without the               multitude, and counter-Empire is not possible without a resurrection               of utopia within the plane of immanence. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s catalogue includes               texts by Immanuel Wallerstein and &Eacute;tienne Balibar to give               nuance to the idea of immanent utopia. Wallerstein calls it &#8220;efficacious               utopia,&#8221; or his neologism Utopistics&#8212;the study of utopia.[37]               The essence of utopia is its connection to imagination, not the               creation of a definite plan, for &#8220;perfect societies not only               do not exist, but in fact, <em>cannot</em> exist.&#8221;[38] Imagination               and production are foregrounded to prediction and prescription.               Balibar&#8217;s utopia is &#8220;an imagination of the present rather               than an imagination of the future.&#8221;[39] Utopia attends to               the here and now, not there and then. It is not a destination, but               a state of working toward utopia, a point en route to itself. Or,               by way of the statement accompanying Trisha Donnelly&#8217;s poster               for <em>Utopia Station</em>: &#8220;The true Rome is man&#8217;s               hope for the true Rome.&#8221;[40] In short, utopia is alive in               process, not plan or product. That said, it is due time to shift               our analytical focus from theories to practices. It is one thing               to set one&#8217;s sights between the hill and the island and quite               another to bring this vista to form. </p>            <p class="second">The practice of Rirkrit Tiravanija, a <em>Utopia               Station</em> curator and artist, undoubtedly provided the working               model for the reconceptualized utopia. Since the late 1980s, Tiravanija               has made the process of exchange and collective production the focus               of his work, inviting viewers to converse, eat, cook, dance, perform,               sleep and relax together. He is known best for serving traditional               Thai meals in gallery and museum spaces, a gesture he began experimenting               with in 1989. His first cooking project, <em>Untitled, 1989</em>               (&#8230;) at Scott Hanson Gallery, New York, featured several plinths               displaying plates of curry in different stages of the cooking process.               The cuisine&#8217;s enticing aroma infused the gallery, but viewers               were not invited to eat. In the earliest manifestation of Tiravanija&#8217;s               long-term culinary project, the focus was on the active transformation               of raw materials/vegetables into a visual and olfactory gift only.               This gesture was brought to its logical conclusion, or rather its               new horizon, when for his next project, <span class="link_underline"><em><a href="http://www.gavinbrown.biz/images/imagetirivanija/RT-(free)c.jpg" class="link_underline">Untitled,               1992 (Free)</a></em></span> at 303 Gallery, New York, Tiravanija               was in the exhibition space cooking and serving Thai food every               day during the show&#8217;s duration. All that was on display was               the artist&#8217;s makeshift kitchen and the continuous performance               of cooking and eating. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Untitled, 1992 (Free)</em> begins a run of seemingly               inexhaustible permutations of interactive encounters centered around               spaces or actions. For <em>Untitled 1996 (Tomorrow's Another Day)</em>,               Tiravanija reconstructed his New York apartment and opened it to               the public 24 hours a day. <em><a href="http://www.gavinbrown.biz/images/imagetirivanija/RT-Studio6(b).jpg" class="link_underline">Untitled               1996 (Rehearsal Studio No. 6 Silent Version)</a></em> was               a free, equipped music rehearsal studio (Figure 7). The apartment               installation has appeared in Germany, New York and London; the studio               in Japan, Switzerland, and Germany. Meanwhile, Tiravanija re-presented               the cooking project at various times and places. By the late 1990s,               he had established a trademark practice that raised challenging               questions about process, exchange, institutionalization, temporality               and representation. For example: Where is the artwork located in               Tiravanija&#8217;s practice? Looking at the interpersonal relations               created by his projects, what happens to exchange when it is institutionally               framed? What behavior is proper to a museum or gallery? How can               his work be represented or documented? My point is not to answer               these questions, but to suggest that, besides expanding the field               of what is acceptable to arts institutions, Tiravanija has played               a major (if not the central) role in bringing these questions to               the forefront of both debates on contemporary art and the trajectory               of art production itself. His approach makes a fitful companion               to the working methods of the multitude and thus to <em>Utopia Station</em>.</p>            <p class="second">One of Tiravanija&#8217;s most complicated projects               to date immediately preceded his involvement in <em>Utopia Station</em>.               It was an installation entitled <em><a href="http://www.secession.at/art/2002_tiravanija_e.html" class="link_underline">Untitled               2002 (He Promised)</a></em> at Secession, Vienna&#8212;a steel and               chrome, reflective, stage-like construction designed after architect               Rudolf Schindler&#8217;s 1921 Los Angeles home (Figure 8). The original               Schindler house was designed to achieve a seamless flow between               inside and outside in order to maintain a sense of flexibility and               spontaneity for domestic space and our actions within it. In Tiravanija&#8217;s               homage, potted plants, cushions, and a television accessorized the               platform and could be rearranged at will. An integral part of work               was a program of lectures, performances, film screenings, and concerts.               Despite the work&#8217;s title, there was no promise of continuous               activity at the installation, but always the tension of the potential               for activity to take place. Individuals would coalesce in significant               events, stragglers would cross in and out, visits were a few minutes               or several hours. The structure remained whether it was being used               or not, though any person entering the space would activate it at               some level, at least as much as his reflection would jump from surface               to surface. It was a space to be used, not for anything in particular,               but particularly for use. There was also a sense of incompleteness,               a characteristic Tiravanija wanted to maintain. At the time of the               work&#8217;s construction, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re basically               going to build it through the &#8216;opening&#8217; so that there               is no opening. There has never really been an opening for me. And               I never feel the need to fix a moment where everything is complete.&#8221;[41]               <em>Untitled 2002 (He Promised)</em> was a location for planned               or chance meetings, open and flexible for different uses. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Untitled 2002 (He Promised)</em> was for Tiravanija               a station, a concept and format he has been working with since 2000               when he founded the Namdee Publishing Station in Bangkok.[42] He               has created television stations, magazine stations and demo recording               stations. He works with stations because they are a &#8220;fluid               construction&#8221;; they create a place where people can meet and               disperse, which can themselves be transported or multiplied.[43]               In a 2003 interview, Hans-Ulrich Obrist asked Tiravanija where his               idea of the station came from, giving clear indication that the               idea to use it as a conceptual framework for the Venice exhibition               came from the Thai artist.</p>            <p class="second"> Looking to <em>Utopia Station</em>, we certainly               see the traces of Tiravanija everywhere. The exhibition is basically               a Tiravanijan project writ large, and at this scale, the normally               charming details of his improvised, boundariless aesthetic become               somewhat incomprehensible and grotesque. To begin, <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s               plan, arranged by Tiravanija and Liam Gillick, divided the space               into several loose zones designed to maximize interaction amongst               visitors and with the various installations. A stage and public               address system near the entranceway signaled that <em>Utopia Station</em>               was a place for use, not just visual delectation. Circular benches               were offered as seats for a proscenium-oriented audience or for               intimate group discussions. But the invitation to utilize this equipment,               however, was not accepted by many people outside the program organized               by the curators. Beyond this first architectural arrangement, the               eye followed a maze of small plywood cubicles, each enclosing a               miniature exhibition, and commissioned posters were sporadically               fly-posted along the walls. None of these spaces or works were clearly               labeled. Outdoors, there was an unmanned GUARAN&Aacute; POWER kiosk               offering (at the time of my visit) nothing&#8212;its inventory had               become the garbage strewn across the lawn. Atelier van Lieshout               had made an environmentally friendly toilet that no longer worked.               The performance and discussion program had taken place during the               first three days of <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s run, and so               for visitors unable to attend opening weekend, it seemed that the               party had already left and followed the curators to their next station               (an exhibition of the commissioned posters in Munich that opened               before <em>Utopia Station</em> closed). <em>Utopia Station</em>&#8217;s               schedule of events created a predetermined fullness, which reinforced               a palpable emptiness when the space went unused. It recalls a project               Tiravanija created for the 1993 Venice Bienniale, <em>Untitled 1993               (twelve seventy one)</em>, where he served Cup O&#8217; Noodles               from a boat and left the garbage-filled vessel as evidence of the               event. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Utopia Station</em> was heavily criticized for               its incomprehensibility and emphasis on exclusive opening weekend               events. <em>Artforum</em> critic Scott Rothkopf wrote, &#8220;[I]t               appeared somehow more meaningful to its actors than its audience&#8230;[T]he               overall presentation suggested a sort of troubling solipsism couched               as activism, an insider&#8217;s conversation in the guise of global               outreach and engagement.&#8221;[44] Michael Kimmelman of the New               York Times called it &#8220;by far the sloppiest, most uninspired,               enervating and passionless biennale that I can recall.&#8221;[45]               Barry Schwabsky had this to say:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> <em>Utopia Station</em> reminded me of nothing                 so much as the Earth Day fair my daughter's school in New York                 used to have every spring, with its hastily constructed booths,                 its posters and flyers, and its slightly embarrassing opportunities                 for interaction with the exhibits&#8212;and above all with its                 implication that just being there one has already shown one's                 good will and begun to do right.[46]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The major critique of <em>Utopia Station</em> goes               for much of Tiravanija&#8217;s work as well: the idealism of the               gesture is undermined by the fact that it cannot continue forever.               All that remains after the celebratory unveiling is a collection               of garbage and unused objects. The temporality of the carnevalesque               is something that both Hardt and Negri and the curators of <em>Utopia               Station</em> ignore. As a revolutionary tactic, its power is its               ceremonious brevity; it upsets conventions, but only temporarily.               When the carnival ends, its objects become lifeless oddities, artificial               significations of joyful activity, and unused tools for manufactured               relations.</p>            <p class="second"> There were a few projects within <em>Utopia Station</em>               that more or less succeeded in involving viewers, because they had               a life outside of the exhibition. The curators&#8217; commissioned               poster project, Superflex&#8217;s GUARAN&Aacute; POWER, and Christoph               Schlingensief&#8217;s <em>Church of Fear</em> gained strength from               being carried out at a larger scale than the Venice presentation.               If disused in Venice, they had been engaged with at some other time               and place. The displayed history of their previous use gave them               a small breath of life.</p>            <p class="second"> It seems that the most successfully interactive               work represented in <em>Utopia Station</em> had the same qualities               as the <em>Utopia Station</em> project as a whole, which emerges               not from a set of objects but from the actions of Obrist, Nesbit               and Tiravanija. <em>Utopia Station</em> is collaborative and mobile,               or rather, an example of the multitude working in the non-place               of Empire. With every iteration, these qualities of the project               have been exaggerated and its politics made explicit. Just before               bringing <em>Utopia Station</em> to the World Social Forum in 2005,               Nesbit wrote:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> The decision to take <em>Utopia Station</em>                 to Porto Alegre sends a jolt into the path of the project&#8212;it                 is tantamount to completely changing its institutional ground,                 which heretofore has been indebted to universities, a biennale,                 a museum and a theatre. This week <em>Utopia Station</em> will                 find itself in a situation where the rules for art's behaviour                 have not been set and the ground from which those concerned proceed                 is in fact a globalized view of the world that does not yet have                 a single project or a name.[47]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The trajectory of <em>Utopia Station</em> raises               a deeply disturbing question. If, to be effective, the counter-Empire               must work within the non-place of Empire&#8212;must &#8220;push               through Empire to come out on the other side&#8221;&#8212;then political               aesthetics must become placeless as well. To suggest political transformation,               must the art object and the museum be replaced by nomadic, performative               practice?</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"> <strong>Natilee Harren</strong> is a doctoral student               in art history at the University of California, Los Angeles.
