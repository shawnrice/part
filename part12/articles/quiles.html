The artist&#8217;s personal book collection               (more than 7,500 titles) was installed in the gallery space, and               visitors were permitted to photocopy whatever they wanted (the books               were not lent out).[3] The library was thus always all there, its               sculptural-architectural presence preserved. For books can be &#8220;books&#8221;               in the sense of their function (able to be opened and read), but               also sculpture (when closed): mere things, rectilinear volumes.               They are both receptacles and mute representations of a given set               of possibilities for knowledge (depending on the capabilities of               the reader). They are like tombstones; silent, perhaps about to               speak. </p>            <p class="second">I wandered around Rosler&#8217;s books oscillating               between self-congratulatory familiarity and discomfited awe. There               were so many books I had never seen before, hadn&#8217;t read yet,               needed to order via Internet that instant. Rosler had her share               of hipster oddities&#8212;etiquette manuals for women, communist               Chinese children&#8217;s books&#8212;but I was transfixed by the               thick, imposing <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/projects/library/books.php" class="link_underline">theory               tomes</a>: Adorno&#8217;s <em>Negative Dialectics</em>, Deleuze&#8217;s               <em>Difference and Repetition</em>, Marx&#8217;s <em>Capital</em>               (all three volumes, no less). It was not that the books presented               a picture of Rosler&#8217;s artistic sensibility, however, so much               that &#8220;Rosler&#8221; seemed a synecdoche for the books, for               all of that knowledge, or, more precisely, non-knowledge, the unknown;               that which I have yet to read, let alone comprehend, and all possible               action such knowledge might catalyze. This is the sort of &#8220;action&#8221;&#8212;art,               activism, art activism&#8212;generated by &#8220;critical theory,&#8221;               in all of its diversity, when Rosler was a young artist in the 1960s               and 1970s: her renowned collage series <span class="link"><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Enavva/photo/index.html" class="link_underline"><em>Bringing               the War Home: House Beautiful</em></a></span> (1967-72), in which               Pop technique was used to expose the nexus of American consumerism               and militarism, or her many influential videos, among them <a href="http://www.ubu.com/film/rosler.html" class="link_underline"><em>Semiotics               of the Kitchen</em></a> (1975), an early marriage of feminist critique               with post-structuralist theory.[4] Her art, this &#8220;library&#8221;               hail from a now-ubiquitous earlier moment (not the moment in which               the books were written, but one in which they were <em>read</em>               in a certain way, together), a double-decade invoked by a weighted               yet unspecific phrase: &#8220;the 1960s and 1970s.&#8221; Not just               an anxiety of influence, then, but something like an anxiety of               <em>era</em>&#8212;a particular era&#8217;s action and ethicality.             </p>            <p class="second">December 8, 2006: the Democrats have new life&#8212;dubious               comfort. At Storefront for Art and Architecture in SoHo, in connection               with an <a href="http://www.clipstampfold.com/" class="link_underline">exhibition</a>               of architectural &#8220;little magazines&#8221; from, as the exhibition               puts it, &#8220;196x-197x,&#8221; <em>October</em> editors Rosalind               Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, and Hal Foster improvise short talks about               their participation in the journals <em>October</em> and (in Bois&#8217;               case) <em>Macula</em>. I was there with what seemed to be every               single person involved in art in New York who had not journeyed               down to <a href="http://www.artbaselmiamibeach.com/ca/cc/ss/" class="link_underline">Art               Basel Miami Beach</a>. We crowded into the miniscule space standing               up, as though at a rock concert, the proverbial &quot;choir&quot;               in all its glory, the latest incarnation of a public or set of publics               that first emerged during the exhibition's ambiguous time frame.               Krauss, clearly bemused by the turnout, spoke very briefly. She               repeatedly noted that the editors at <em>Artforum</em> &#8220;all               hated each other&#8221; prior to her and Annette Michelson&#8217;s               departure from the glossy commercial magazine to form the iconoclastic               <em>October</em>, and recalled the well-known fact that the warring               was between the &#8220;social possibilities&#8221; of art criticism               and history versus &#8220;formalism&#8221; (one which used poststructuralist               theory to decipher aesthetic experience). Bois gave a very short               history of his journal <em>Macula</em> as a site for translation               of various texts, and offered the DIY encouragement that &#8220;if               you&#8217;re going to start a journal, you don&#8217;t need money.               You just need a printer who will agreed to be paid back after six               months or so.&#8221;[5] </p>            <p class="second">Then it was Foster&#8217;s turn. He first admitted               that, being younger, he had not really been part of the era in question.               Indeed, it was obvious that the reasons he was speaking were that               a) Princeton architectural history students had curated the show               and b) he was a later, yet highly significant, addition to the <em>October</em>               circle who is today indistinguishable from it. As every art historian               knows, with Benjamin Buchloh these scholars comprise a Big Four.               They are the public face of the journal and what is perceived as               its consistent ethos, and have thus been dubbed &#8220;Octobrists&#8221;               and &#8220;Octoberites&#8221;&#8212;nicknames that exaggerate the               journal&#8217;s reference to the October Revolution.[6] Foster discussed               the importance of <em>Situationist International</em> and <em>Utopie</em>,               among others, as well as the Institute of Architecture and Urban               Studies, for his generation of young scholars in the early 1980s.               In closing, he offered a telling caveat that evinced his awareness               of his mediating position between Krauss&#8217;s generation and               that which the group was addressing:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">In a way I think a terrific project would be to                 carry on this exhibition. That said, one thing that does concern                 me&#8230; it&#8217;s an anxiety about many projects today&#8230;                 about premature historicization. I think this field is still wide                 open in many ways, and I think there&#8217;s a way in which we                 have to be careful as we historicize the near past.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">In the question and answer session that followed,               Foster was asked to clarify this seemingly contradictory position               (future scholars, make sure to write about these magazines&#8212;but               not too much!). &#8220;The book is not yet written on some of these               magazines,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;even ones that are long dead...               I just don&#8217;t want them to be turned into doctoral projects               one by one, and murdered in that way.&#8221;</p>            <p class="second">What would it mean to &#8220;murder&#8221; a little               magazine, or a journal such as <em>October</em>? Could it be that               there are right and wrong ways of coming to terms with this recent,               intimidating history of artistic and intellectual production? Or               can Foster be taken more literally&#8212;is he perhaps inadvertently               speaking of the &#8220;murder&#8221;&#8212;via consignment to a               history, however vaunted&#8212;of Krauss, Bois, even himself?</p>            <p class="second">In his book <em>Specters of Marx: The State of the               Debt, the Work of Mourning, and the New International</em>, Derrida               argues that Marxism has persisted since its origins (and in a way               fully anticipated by Marx himself) as a &#8220;specter,&#8221; a               ghostly presence from the past, that exerts pressure on the present.               Why a specter, a ghost? Because Marxism is always already dead,               always already finished as a politics of any worth, and was from               its inception. It lingers as a delusory ideal with virtually no               practical possibility, but also, simultaneously, as an unfinished               project, a desire unfulfilled, a duty that has now fallen to us               (the ever-shifting &#8220;us&#8221; of whoever is alive at present).               As such, this specter is all the more powerful, for it is not only               past but <em>future</em>&#8212;it is orderly time collapsed&#8212;it               comes from the past, dead, to invoke what must be done.</p>            <p class="second">As a figure for this phenomenon, Derrida uses the               Ghost from <em>Hamlet</em>, who arrives from the past to foretell,               or more specifically to demand, the future. Hamlet&#8217;s father               is dead, he is in the past, yet he returns to compel Hamlet to avenge               his death. His impossible projection&#8212;from the past into the               present to determine the future&#8212;sets up the protagonist&#8217;s               legendary bind. Likewise, the incomplete revolutions of the past               haunt the present; we are charged with &#8220;avenging their deaths&#8221;               by fulfilling their legacies of commitment and sacrifice. </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">A messianic promise, even if it was not fulfilled,                 at least in the form in which it was uttered, even if it rushed                 headlong toward an ontological content, will have imprinted an                 inaugural and unique mark in history. And whether we like it or                 not, whatever consciousness we have of it, we cannot not be its                 heirs. There is no inheritance without a call to responsibility.[7]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">It is the texts of Marx himself, these traces of               his voice(s), which make up the substance of the specter, its affective               matter:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> Marx, for his part, announces and calls for a                 presence to come&#8230; The <em>Manifesto</em> calls, it calls                 for this presentation of the living reality: we must see to it                 that in the future this specter&#8212;and first of all an association                 of workers forced to remain secret until about 1848&#8212;becomes                 a <em>reality</em>, and a <em>living</em> reality. This real life                 must show itself and manifest itself, it must <em>present itself</em>                 beyond Europe, old or new Europe, in the universal dimension of                 an International.[8]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The specter is thereby susceptible to Derrida&#8217;s               edict that language always produces effects of deconstruction: the               haunting that Marx&#8217;s specter achieves is to have Marx&#8217;s               own discourse be mutated into various interpretations, various &#8220;voices,&#8221;               all of which might aspire to fulfill their spectral historical destiny.             </p>            <p class="second"> &#8220;A masterpiece always moves,&#8221; writes               Derrida, &#8220;by definition, in the manner of a ghost.&#8221;[9]               How curiously close he is here to Harold Bloom, whose <em>Anxiety               of Influence</em>, of 1973, makes for both hilarious and maddening               reading today. This flamboyantly outmoded work of literary theory               is filled to the brim with romantic, sexist, absolutely traditional               notions of poetic &#8220;greatness.&#8221; As opposed to a critique               of authorship, this is an attempt to explicate and legitimize authorship,               as myth, once and for all. Yet it is also the source (if Bloom would               not cede this to Freud) of a theory quite close to Derrida&#8217;s:               a poet&#8217;s great struggle is with his (or her&#8212;I am cleaning               up Bloom&#8217;s own anachrony here) most profound influence, his/her               artistic &#8220;father.&#8221; This father lays down the &#8220;law&#8221;               that is his great oeuvre, with its particular rules and innovations,               and the younger artist must surpass this earlier work, must &#8220;kill               the father&#8221; (even if he is already dead) by doing something               new. Bracketing Bloom&#8217;s patriarchal economy for the moment,               is not this artistic fore-parent in fact Derrida&#8217;s specter,               that ghost from the past who demands vengeance, even if <em>upon</em>               him- or herself? &#8220;The ephebe who fears his precursors as he               might fear a flood is taking a vital part for a whole, the whole               being everything that constitutes his creative anxiety, the spectral               blocking agent in every poet.&#8221;[10] The various strategies&#8212;&#8220;poetic               misprision,&#8221; &#8220;completion,&#8221; &#8220;repetition and               discontinuity,&#8221; and so on&#8212;that Bloom outlines for getting               through, around, or away from the spectral text/author parallel               Derrida&#8217;s description of Marx&#8217;s dissemination:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> Guaranteed translatability, given homogeneity,                 systematic coherence in their <em>absolute forms</em>, this is                 surely (certainly, <em>a priori</em> and not probably) what renders                 the injunction, the inheritance, and the future&#8212;in a word                 the other&#8212;<em>impossible</em>. <em>There must be</em> disjunction,                 interruption, the heterogeneous if at least <em>there must be,                 if there must be</em> a chance given to any &#8220;there must                 be&#8221; whatsoever, be it beyond duty.[11]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second"> For both Derrida and Bloom, movement into the future               is conditioned by an anxious eye toward the past, necessitating               painful, seemingly impossible divergence from the earlier work or               act.<br>              <br>              The ghost which now haunts &#8220;us&#8221;&#8212;for my purposes,               today&#8217;s rising generation of art critics and scholars, but               also certainly artists as well&#8212;is not so much these earlier               revolutions in the name of bourgeois or proletarian rights but the               entire double-decade of the &#8220;1960s and 1970s.&#8221; It is               here that Derrida&#8217;s specter meets Bloom&#8217;s artistic parent:               it is a dual legacy of activism and culture that seems unsurpassable.               Thus we are beyond a single author and instead struggle under the               weight of an entire spectral/&#8220;fatherly&#8221; <em>era</em>:               multiple parents, contradictory messages and edicts. And not just               Marx, I would argue: Marx is one important element, but so is, for               example, feminism, which, however much it can be likened to earlier               struggles of marginalized subjects versus a dominant order, was               simultaneously fundamentally opposed to the prioritization of the               Marxist agenda. </p>            <p class="second">The 1960s/1970s operate on different levels, the               first and broadest being the political. In 1968, the pivotal year               of the spectral &#8220;1960s/1970s,&#8221; the failed &#8220;revolution&#8221;               which took place on university campuses and in streets across much               of the West&#8212;a momentary uprising against various formations               of power&#8212;set a standard that seems impossible today. The very               extremes of political action at that moment, particularly the progression               from peaceful protest in the 1960s to the more militant groups of               the 1970s, account for contemporary skepticism towards activism.               What can we try that they didn&#8217;t? Is there any value in rehashing               the strategies of the past? As noted by many, the nonviolent antiwar               protests of recent years, even the very well attended ones, have               provided such a meager sense of accomplishment, the melancholy of               obligation without the hope of supersession (even the seemingly               novel turn of certain antiglobalists to violence, beginning in 1999               during the WTO protests in Seattle [13] and later elsewhere, was               by no means novel, and in fact precisely echoed the futility of               violent leftist groups in the 1970s such as the Weather Underground               and Baader-Meinhof). The key is that these efforts end in failure,               in the dismal 1970s, with states having largely succeeded in containing               revolutionary zeal and leftist movements having been rent apart.               That is what is conveyed by the &#8220;and&#8221; of the phrase               &#8220;1960s and 1970s&#8221;: not just an era but a narrative,               a progression, a story of failed ambitions that is the strangest               and most greedy of legitimations. That is, the era retains an aura               of purity because of na&iuml;vet&eacute; about its own futility,               whilst we in the present are not allowed such a luxury&#8212;our               efforts seem doomed from the start. </p>            <p class="second">Another, closely interrelated, level on which the               specter operates is of course culture&#8212;for my purposes here,               art and &#8220;art writing&#8221; (curatorial, critical, historical).               The rhetoric of failure is just as evident here, exemplified in               Ian Burn&#8217;s contention that &#8220;perhaps the most significant               thing that can be said to the credit of Conceptual Art is that it               <em>failed</em>.&#8221;[14] Yet it is just as important to isolate               and recognize the multiplicity of approaches that 1960s optimism               produced. As Frederic Jameson argues in his article &#8220;Periodizing               the 60s,&#8221; the dialectic of power in the Vietnam War between               East and West, &#8220;developed&#8221; and &#8220;developing&#8221;               countries, exploiters and exploited, became an analogy for power               relations in cultural spheres.[15] Artists in the United States,               for example, saw themselves as acting politically when they protested               (or devised art that interrogated) powerful art institutions such               as museums, which were fit into the empowered side of the equation               against the powerless artist or viewer. Collaboration in artistic               practice was seen to parallel or contribute to its political variant,               organized action, as were the myriad attempts to undo, in conceptual               art and elsewhere, the commodification of the artwork (which include               the conceptualist expansion of the artwork beyond the discrete object,               the development of alternative exhibition spaces, the publication               of little magazines, the insertion of art into magazines, and so               on). </p>            <p class="second">Subsequent art criticism has, perhaps artificially,               shaped this era into two general threads. On the one hand much art               of the 1960s, for example Minimalism, Post-Minimalism, Earthworks,               and Body Art, was abstract and non-referential, even as concessions               were made toward the experience of the viewer and an increasing               awareness of the gallery context. On the other, many artists, including               many of the same artists, engaged in explicit protest. Art institutions               such as the Museum of Modern Art became targets for, among other               things, their lack of consideration for how artists wanted their               work exhibited. Larger political issues, in particular the Vietnam               War, were directly addressed in projects such as the San Francisco               <em>Peace Tower</em> of 1966, which was recently recreated for <em>Day               for Night</em>, the 2006 Whitney Biennial. In Latin America (not               to mention myriad other contexts), activist projects such as Argentina&#8217;s               <em>Tucum&aacute;n Arde</em>, a collaboration with a leftist union,               voiced opposition to local dictatorships, risking censorship and               worse.[16] Although these two approaches might seem fundamentally               opposed, there are numerous cases of artists quite simply doing               both: in some cases separating their abstract art from their personal               activism (Donald Judd), and in others gradually addressing the institutional-political               register through conceptual strategies (most visibly Hans Haacke               and Martha Rosler, but also many others). </p>            <p class="second">The manner in which art historians now come to learn               of the 1960s, however, is through the turn in art criticism inaugurated               by the founding of <em>October</em> in 1976.[17] Contra <em>Artforum</em>               and other art magazines of the 1960s, it was <em>October</em>&#8217;s               contention, as implied by its title, that politicality was not in               fact to be found in propagandistic reference to existing political               struggles but within the aesthetic field itself, in a revolution               in formal analysis that was to perhaps mirror but never open onto               revolution in the political sphere. As Bois explained at Storefront:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">The notion that the structure of a work of art                 is revealing of its implications was something that was carried                 on by the structuralists and the poststructuralists&#8230; I think                 that <em>October</em> and <em>Macula</em> shared this view that                 of course there was a deep political commitment among the editors,                 but we were not qualified to be simply directly political. We                 thought that giving the tools for semantic or structural analysis                 through what might be called the &#8220;formalist method&#8221;                 was actually a kind of political act.</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The overt politicality of the 1960s was thus displaced,               deferred onto the interpretive practice of formalism and those modes               of art that best supported such interpretation. </p>            <p class="second">Some details are necessary here for a more accurate               picture of <em>October</em>&#8217;s initial project. Annette Michelson,               who initially interested Krauss in structuralist and poststructuralist               theory, co-founded the journal with Krauss, and it was thus dedicated               equally to art and film. Of far more importance for the early years               of <em>October</em> than Bois (who first published in the Autumn               1979 issue) or Buchloh (Spring 1980 as a contributor, Spring 1981               with a full article) were Douglas Crimp, who was executive editor,               and Craig Owens (whose death in 1990 has virtually expelled him               from the historical record), both of whom began as formalists in               the Krauss vein and later turned to queer theory (precipitating               a nasty schism over the Crimp-supervised, overtly political Winter               1987 special issue on AIDS). It was thanks to these scholars that               the journal gained its initial foothold in the academy, joining               in the culture wars with other journals sympathetic to French theory               such as <em>Critical Inquiry</em> in instituting a, well, more critical               inquiry across disciplines. Foster did not publish in the journal               until the Autumn 1985 issue, nearly a decade into its run. While               the journal translated many usual suspects such as Foucault, Barthes,               and Derrida, it also published many things we might not normally               associate with it: Futurist poetry, for example, or film reviews               from the Argentine literary journal <em>Sur</em>. The specter, however,               is composed of precisely our present associations, which tie Krauss&#8217;s               formalism to Buchloh&#8217;s rigid historical determinism: a <em>telos</em>               of twentieth-century art that sees artists continually battling,               via rigorous formal methods, the commodification of their work and               competencies, leading up to the ascetic practices of orthodox conceptualism&#8212;the               noble failure that diminishes our present, the call to action that               is simultaneously a call to doubt.</p>            <p class="second">In trying to think around Buchloh&#8217;s dismal               schema, Foster figures our present moment purely in terms of the               specter: &#8220;[O]ur condition is largely one of aftermath&#8212;that               we live in the wake not only of modernist painting and sculpture               but of postmodernist deconstructions of these forms as well, in               the wake not only of the prewar avant-gardes but of the postwar               neo-avant-gardes as well.&#8221;[18] What, then, are artists, art               critics, and art historians looking for appropriate objects of study               to do? Like the historian, they must acknowledge this condition               first and foremost, making &#8220;living-on&#8221; the foundation               of their practice: </p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">I can only sketch a few versions of this living-on,                 which I will call &#8220;traumatic,&#8221; &#8220;spectral,&#8221;                 &#8220;nonsynchronous,&#8221; and &#8220;incongruent.&#8221; &#8230;Even                 as the practices I have in mind often treat given genres or mediums                 as somehow completed, they do not pastiche them in a posthistorical                 manner. &#8230;These practices point to a semi-autonomy of genre                 or medium, but in a reflexive way that opens onto social issues&#8230;                 Through formal transformation that is also social engagement,                 then, such work helps to restore a mnemonic dimension to contemporary                 art, and to resist the presentist totality of design in culture                 today.[19]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The problem here is that he who has staked an art               historical project on the notion of the failure of 1960s upheaval               would have us labor melancholically under this failure&#8217;s onus,               forever confirming art&#8217;s (and perhaps even art history&#8217;s)               &#8220;exhaustion.&#8221; </p>            <p class="second">I do not want to overstate the impact of <em>October</em>,               nor its uniqueness. There are certainly many other specters from               this period, even equally prescriptive ones, such as Art &amp; Language,               the Whitney Independent Study Program, T.J. Clark&#8217;s ongoing               project of social art history, feminist criticism, and so on.[20]               There are also certainly plenty of other accepted approaches to               art history currently proliferating in the academy, from non-theoretical               social history to Friedian close reading&#8212;although many of               these, I would argue, are quite self-consciously <em>not</em> prescriptive.[21]               <em>October</em>, however, makes for an excellent case study of               the 1960s/1970s specter: the Big Four are prominently installed               in the art history programs at Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia               (Krauss, now emerita, continues to teach and influence the program).               In addition, their recent publication of the &#8220;undergraduate               level&#8221; twentieth-century art history textbook <em>Art Since               1900: Modernism, Antimodernism, Postmodernism</em> (New York: Thames               and Hudson, 2005) constitutes the most visible effort to date to               canonize their ideas and render them gospel for generations to come.               Synopsizing key movements in Western art by addressing one year               at a time (some years receive more than one section, and others               are skipped entirely), the book gradually recapitulates the history               of its four authors&#8217; arguments about twentieth-century art               in all of their difficulty. Dense introductory sections on theory               (&#8220;Psychoanalysis,&#8221; &#8220;Poststructuralism,&#8221;               etc.) and even a glossary constitute very optimistic attempts to               make this material more accessible to undergraduates. </p>            <p class="second"><em>Art Since 1900</em> is a quite deliberate self-spectralization               (as is, of course, all writing&#8212;but there is nothing more didactic               than a textbook). As many critics of the project have noted, the               history that is sketched includes value judgments, which is logical,               given that all of the Big Four began their careers as critics.[22]               In short, <em>Art Since 1900</em> not only provides a canon but               is quite explicit about what might be called &#8220;kosher&#8221;               and &#8220;unkosher&#8221; twentieth-century practices: Dada over               <em>rappel &aacute; l&#8217;ordre</em>, Rauschenberg over Kienholz,               conceptual art over feminism. It is clear that these value judgments               are read back through the period of the 1960s and 1970s (through               Minimalism and institution critique in particular), of which 1968               is the watershed. Pamela Lee notes the slight stature of the year               1969 in <em>Art Since 1900</em>. &#8220;1969,&#8221; she writes,               &#8220;represents the moment at which artists begin to labor under               the long shadow of 1968&#8230; one could argue, the year 1968 more               and more acts like 1945 once did in the literature on twentieth-century               art, the invisible line in the sand announcing the &#8216;then&#8217;               and &#8216;now&#8217; of modernism&#8217;s larger project.&#8221;[23]</p>            <p class="second">In the roundtable that concludes <em>Art Since 1900</em>,               this amusing exchange starts things off:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"><strong>RK:</strong> We&#8217;ve structured our                 entries on twentieth-century art through the analytical perspectives                 that each one of us tends to favor: Hal&#8217;s is a psychoanalytic                 view; Benjamin&#8217;s, a social-historical view; Yve-Alain&#8217;s,                 a formalist and structuralist view; and mine, a poststructuralist                 view. One way to look back on the development of postwar art is                 to consider what happened to those methodological tools&#8212;how                 their relevance grew or diminished.<br>                <strong>YAB:</strong> None of us is married to a particular method.<br>                <strong>HF:</strong> Right: my commitment to psychoanalysis is                 not as strong as you suggest&#8230;[24]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Bois and Foster&#8217;s disavowals cannot mask the               truth that it does not contradict the widespread accusations of               hegemony that the approaches of the Big Four are in fact varied               and sometimes even contradictory. That is, representing a wider               range of critical perspectives, all of which are thus &#8220;kosher,&#8221;               means that the Octoberites in fact cover more ground, and are that               much harder to dispute. Krauss and Bois&#8217; formalism, for example,               lionizes artists such as Barnett Newman or David Smith, who Buchloh               might condemn as insufficiently political&#8212;thereby coopting               this critique in advance. </p>            <p class="second">It is thanks to Buchloh&#8217;s withering Adornian               pessimism that the Octoberites have an reputation for an ascetic,               closed-minded attitude towards new art and new practices. In the               roundtable Buchloh repeatedly blasts contemporary artists such as               Matthew Barney and Bill Viola as &#8220;spectacle&#8221;&#8212;clearly               a catch-all for too much illusion, obscuring of technique, and/or               pop-cultural reference. While snap dismissals of new practices mark               certain of Krauss&#8217;s writings (such as &#8220;Video and the               Aesthetics of Narcissism&#8221; and the &#8220;No To&#8230;&#8221;               chapters in the <em>Informe</em> book), she has been just as likely               to produce models for the &#8220;expansion&#8221; of practices&#8212;here               I am thinking of &#8220;Sculpture in the Expanded Field&#8221; and               <em>A Voyage on the North Sea</em>. Using what she calls her &#8220;poststructuralist               view,&#8221; Krauss has provided models for comprehending practices               that quite literally extend beyond medium specificity and are thus               still quite relevant for today&#8217;s most cutting-edge art. Her               recent proposal for a &#8220;postmedium condition,&#8221; in which               &#8220;medium&#8221; is redefined as a &#8220;&#8216;recursive structure&#8217;&#8212;a               structure, that is, some of the elements of which will produce the               rules that generate the structure itself&#8230; Further, that this               recursive structure is something made, rather than something given,               is what is latent in the traditional connection of &#8216;medium&#8217;               to matters of technique&#8230;&#8221;[25] In the concluding <em>Art               Since 1900</em> roundtable, the other Octoberites reject this model               as a regression to modernist medium-specificity, but it may yet               prove one of the best tools for understanding the move to multimedia               circa 1960 that today is taken for granted as our (non-)paradigm.               Krauss&#8217;s writing might thus be said to &#8220;differ from               itself,&#8221; as one founding poststructuralist might have put               it.</p>            <p class="second">&#8220;The poet <em>in every reader</em>,&#8221;               argues Bloom, &#8220;does not experience the same disjunction from               what he reads that the critic in every reader necessarily feels.               What gives pleasure to the critic in a reader may give anxiety to               the poet in him, an anxiety we have learned, as readers, to neglect,               to our own loss and peril.&#8221;[26] Derrida concurs, &#8220;There               has never been a scholar who really, and as scholar, deals with               ghosts. A traditional scholar does not believe in ghosts&#8212;nor               in all that could be called the virtual space of spectrality.&#8221;[27]               Yet I contend that art historians are by no means exempt from this               poetic negotiation, in writing, with the specter. This accords with               the art historical lineage of what Krauss termed &#8220;the paraliterary&#8221;               (works of earlier critics such as Michael Fried and T.J. Clark can               also be included here): &#8220;instead of a work&#8217;s being &#8216;about&#8217;               the July Monarchy or death and money, it is &#8216;about&#8217;               its own strategies of construction, its own linguistic operations,               its own revelation of convention, its own surface.&#8221;[28] In               a Krauss class that I audited, she described her impulse in writing               her least accessible book, <em>The Optical Unconscious</em>, as               that of &#8220;wanting to write a novel.&#8221; This more poetic               or literary form of academic discourse, however, can be extended               to the less opaque offerings from Octoberites and non-Octoberites               alike. There is no doubt that Krauss struggled with Greenberg as               a specter hanging over her formalism; in the very application of               &#8220;theory&#8221; to art there is a <em>creative</em> move that               is more apiece with literature than reportage (indeed, it is this               practice that is the most consistent aspect of the <em>October</em>               legacy, allowing, &aacute; la the <em>Martha Rosler Library</em>               for a plethora of sometimes oppositional source texts to congeal               into an imposing, self-legitimating base). It is those scholars               who successfully take up this challenge who are the most prominent               art historians today. For there is a rarely uttered suspicion, true               or not, fair or not, that anyone can spend months in archives digging               up minutiae and crafting history but only certain scholars can assimilate               and work with theory in a convincing manner. </p>            <p class="second">A key characteristic of the specter is that even               an attempt to deny it, or to structure a model in opposition to               it, reaffirms its original/ating power as the starting point, the               law or command. Think of a banker&#8217;s son who rebels by fashioning               himself a stoner spiritualist. This son is still made in his father&#8217;s               image; he has merely achieved an opposite that perpetually invokes               its source, its productive obverse. In opposition (of sorts) to               Foster&#8217;s &#8220;living-on,&#8221; then, I will consider several               contemporary strategies of &#8220;moving forward&#8221;: responses               to the art historical specter of the 1960s and 1970s. These methods               are not exclusive of one another; they can and have been combined.               I will sully this moving-forward with a simultaneous moving-backward,               juxtaposing, with deliberate irony, Bloom&#8217;s outmoded lexicon               with such new attempts to broaden our field. While I primarily will               be addressing art historians, it will be evident that many of these               ideas have also entered art practice (a symptom of the lasting influence               of <em>October</em> even in that arena, thanks to the ubiquity of               theoretically oriented MFA programs). Again, this is not to posit               <em>Art Since 1900</em> as the lone spectral pressure out there;               it merely makes for a convenient center around which to group responses               because of its clear prescriptions and established position within               the field.</p>            <p class="second"><strong>1. The &#8220;Non-West,&#8221; or <em>clinamen</em>:</strong>               Bloom&#8217;s famous &#8220;misprision&#8221; or &#8220;swerve&#8221;               away from the precedent is here geographical, defined negatively               by the very problematic power relation that designates such a non-place               as &#8220;non-West&#8221; in the first place. Foster himself alludes               to this as an insufficiently explored category in the concluding               roundtable in <em>Art Since 1900</em>: &#8220;Other possibilities               also opened up in other parts of the globe, especially in various               encounters with different modernisms. &#8230; It&#8217;s a narrative               of cultural <em>differ&aacute;nce</em>&#8212;of avant-garde practices               in other place-times.&#8221;[29] Of course, the notion of the &#8220;non-West&#8221;               is absurd, far too general, and immediately breaks down into unrelated               subcategories; but this absurdity is also <em>real</em> insofar               as there is still so much left to be said about these myriad peripheries.</p>            <p class="second"><strong>2. The &#8220;wrong&#8221; artists, or <em>tessera</em>:</strong>               wherein a project of &#8220;completion&#8221; of the Octoberite               project in fact necessitates a gross violation of <em>October</em>&#8217;s               prescriptions. This means the use of theory to take seriously the               very folks that <em>October</em> never took seriously or used as               straw men, among them artists who shamelessly engaged &#8220;myth&#8221;               such as Josef Beuys, Yves Klein, Vito Acconci, Hannah Wilke, etc.               An excellent example of this is David Joselit&#8217;s critique of               Krauss&#8217;s position on video art in his article &#8220;The Video               Public Sphere,&#8221; in which he argues that instead of merely               pointing at himself on the video screen, Acconci and other video               artists were reaching out to the viewer.[30] </p>            <p class="second"><strong>3. Visual culture, or <em>kenosis</em>:</strong>               this &#8220;break&#8221; with the specter can be linked to the present               vogue for applying theoretical analysis to the wider field of visual               content throughout culture, as in the work of someone such as W.J.T.               Mitchell. In this shift of object of study there is a refusal of               the question of quality altogether that opens art history onto the               field of anthropology. In anthropology, everything is &#8220;interesting&#8221;&#8212;all               of human activity is of equal relevance to the field. I would argue,               however, that this is merely a momentary escape from the question               of quality. For the scholar must still convince us, using superior               interpretive skill, that a given visual object warrants attention               over so many others; &#8220;quality&#8221; is in some sense shifted               onto the writer contributing unique knowledge about the object.             </p>            <p class="second"><strong>4. The cooptation of new theory, or <em>daemonization</em>:</strong>               Bloom cryptically indicates that &#8220;the later poet opens himself               to what he believes to be a power in the parent-poem that does not               belong to the parent proper.&#8221;[31] For us this &#8220;power&#8221;               is theory, the original texts that inspired the canonical <em>October</em>               writings (consider Krauss&#8217;s eschewing of citation in her early               texts). One strategy here is to unearth newer or less-utilized theoretical               texts for our source of interpretive &#8220;power&#8221;; recent               vogues for Gilles Deleuze/Felix Guattari, Giorgio Agamben, and Jean-Luc               Nancy come to mind. Two of the best new critical paradigms, which               may someday soon displace the Octoberites as reigning models for               contemporary art, have been advanced by Nicolas Bourriaud and Okwui               Enwezor.[32]</p>            <p class="second"><strong>5. Subject-positioning, or <em>askesis</em>:</strong>               the &#8220;movement of self-purgation&#8221; before the spectral               precedent is given to the already waning practice, in great vogue               in the 1980s and early 1990s, of &#8220;self-positioning,&#8221;               that is, writing art history from an admittedly partial perspective,               which opens naturally onto art that privileges such perspectives               in relation to race, sexual orientation, gender, etc. Amelia Jones               rightly observes of <em>Art Since 1900</em> that &#8220;the authors               convey a general methodological suspicion of the subjective, accompanied               by an erasure of the specificity of bodies and desires (including,               most specifically, their own), while writing in a highly authoritative               manner, stating opinions as fact.&#8221;[33] Of course, this comment               compels me to ask whether we really want to know the desires of               these scholars, but at the very least this stance is admirable for               its commitment to non-authoritative knowledge, the utter obverse               of the textbook&#8217;s aims. </p>            <p class="second"><strong>6. The &#8220;right&#8221; artists, or <em>aprophades</em>:</strong>               Bloom&#8217;s &#8220;return of the dead&#8221; is a very complicated               notion, as it contends on the one hand that the specter &#8220;wins&#8221;               and is easily recognizable in the later work, and on the other that               the later author can somehow magically reverse the terms of spectrality               and make the earlier work seem subservient, or contingent upon,               the new. Those who focus on the <em>October</em> stable (particularly               the postwar artists) undertake the daunting task of conversation               with highly regarded arguments, and must solve the spectral dilemma               of whether to simply esteem these earlier perspectives, diminishing               the importance of one&#8217;s own project, reject them (which, as               explained above, does more or less the same), or somehow meet them               on even ground. We do not, however, have to look at this notion               solely in terms of trumping predecessors. It can be useful to acknowledge               their presence in our work no matter what we write about, situating               ourselves in a lineage of ethical scholarship. In this way, <em>not</em>               being a poet&#8212;having footnotes at our disposal, for example&#8212;can               come in handy. </p>            <p class="second">In this final sense, <em>aprophades</em> links all               the approaches above, in that no matter how one &#8220;swerves&#8221;               away from one&#8217;s predecessor, some trace will still persist               of this earlier writer or paradigm, even if only the ethical trace&#8212;the               specter&#8217;s command&#8212;which had motivated us to write (or               make art, or act&#8230;) in the first place. Derrida characterizes               this ethical call as a &#8220;debt&#8221; that we have accrued without               knowing it, an unexpected burden. In terms of the specter of the               1960s/1970s that I have sketched above, debt functions within a               continual project of re-visitation, revision, and expansion. Our               debt to a writer such as Krauss, for example, entails a re-writing,               or deviation, from her project(s) that is nonetheless true to her               spectral edict for us. I have shown how such a split persists in               Krauss&#8217;s own writings, between open-ended, ever-expanding               interpretive models and at times quite rigid notions of good and               bad. Perhaps our debt is to combine such oppositional tendencies,               even if against themselves: to open art history beyond the dominant               canon on the one hand while nevertheless taking stands on &#8220;quality,&#8221;               whether in terms of form, politics, historical self-awareness (including               that of media), or a combination thereof.</p>            <p class="second">An important caveat: however much any of these options               has been celebrated as politically or academically salvific, however               much a corrective to <em>October</em> or the larger art historical               record in general any of them may be, they all remain compatible               with the until-now obfuscated dimension of this spectral economy&#8212;the               economy itself. Good critique and good scholarship mean good job               security (if we&#8217;re lucky!). Negotiating the specter may entail               the excavation of ideas from a radical past, but such work is also               a quite practical dimension of our careers. The academic field thrives               on the ever new, on repeated reconfigurations of fields, and on               our ability to adapt and contribute to such real or perceived progress.               To champion the cause of the obscure vernacular practices, neglected               artists, or peripheral art scenes is to simultaneously expand competencies               and job opportunities; it is to create new specializations. I do               not believe that this state of affairs necessarily invalidates or               cheapens what we do or dulls its exigency; but it must be conceded               as a conditioning factor. It literalizes Bloom&#8217;s least tasteful,               macho dimension&#8212;his taste for crass competition: we are all               competing for jobs.</p>            <p class="second">To end where I begin: in April 2006, I attended               a rather disorganized reading group in conjunction with the <em>Martha               Rosler Library</em> project. The readings, several different texts               by Walter Benjamin, had been chosen hastily and seemed to lack an               overall focus. Once the group got underway, it was apparent that               there was little direction to the discussion; to fill the void,               Rosler held forth on a variety of subjects. She lambasted the 2006               Whitney Biennial for defanging Richard Serra&#8217;s <em>Defeat               Bush</em> poster, which had originally appeared in <em>Artforum</em>               as a work of pure agit-prop, by framing and hanging it among so               many other artworks. She discussed the reproduction and sale of               her own <em>Bring the War Home</em> collages in the 1980s, explaining               why at a certain point she simply opted to convert them into commodities.               A sense of despair hung over the proceedings. All current political               strategies, in art or the larger political sphere, seemed ineffective.               Rosler had no answers. At one point, with the group increasingly               frustrated with the formlessness of the discussion, 1960s-style               peaceful protest came under fire. The familiar lament surfaced that               today&#8217;s protests accomplish nothing, that there is no point               in even going to them anymore. Suddenly Rosler came angrily to life.</p>            <p class="second">&#8220;No, no, you don&#8217;t understand!&#8221;               she exclaimed. &#8220;Protests are <em>all we have</em>. People               going into the streets&#8212;that is our only way citizens can express               dissatisfaction with what a government is doing. It is a mode of               public embarrassment for that state. The value of that gesture is               never going to go away.&#8221;</p>            <p class="second">A beat of shamed silence followed.

The &#8220;Octoberites&#8221;               could just as well be called &#8220;MITites&#8221; for their longstanding               association with The MIT Press, which distributes both Zone and               October Books and has published a great many of the writers associated               with <em>October</em>, including all of the Big Four as well as               Douglas Crimp, Jonathan Crary, Thierry de Duve, Anthony Vidler,               Pamela Lee, Brandon Joseph, Miwon Kwon, and many more.<br>              [7] <em>Specters of Marx</em>, p. 91.<br>              [8] Ibid, p. 102.<br>              [9] Ibid, p. 18.<br>              [10] <em>The Anxiety of Influence</em>, p. 57. My emphasis.<br>              [11] <em>Specters of Marx</em>, p. 35.<br>              [12] I do not intend here to neglect or dispute the extensive critiques               of Bloom&#8217;s project, nor the prior situating of the text by               intellectual historians as not a Freudian reiteration of Romantic               notions of self-realization (via &#8220;finding one&#8217;s father&#8221;)               but as a Romantic text itself. My hope is that in a productive integration               of Bloom&#8217;s text with Derrida&#8217;s that some of its romantic               ties might be loosened. My aim is not to mystify academic writing               or artistic practice, but to retain the category of &#8220;anxiety&#8221;               as a kind of awareness of limited options in the face of, for lack               of a better word, &#8220;strong&#8221; precedents. Such a framework,               however, is not incompatible with the highly un-romantic purview               of Pierre Bourdieu. One only needs to think in terms of the notion               of competency in the academic or artistic marketplace. To produce               the &#8220;new&#8221; contributions, the capital, that is necessary               for all of us to advance in our careers, this creative negotiation               with the past still needs to take place. A truly cynical Bourdieuian               perspective might argue that the &#8220;specter of the 1960s and               1970s&#8221; is a convenient marketing tool/structuring discourse               for the current fields of contemporary art and art history&#8212;one               very much already in operation and arguably the dominant paradigm               in contemporary art history. In art, clever references to this hallowed               recent past have become a requisite form of demonstrating intelligence;               in art history, acknowledging the importance of this period has               become a routine signifier of competency. As I find such a perspective,               with its complete disregard for the potential value of creative               activity, depressing, I prefer to focus on practice. This is my               central question here. Adding Derrida&#8217;s take on Marx to Bloom               allows us to consider an &#8220;influence of anxiety&#8221; that               is not directed at a lone &#8220;father&#8221; figure, but at an               entire historical period with heteroclite, even contradictory, achievements               and lessons.

While on the one hand the &#8220;political               art&#8221; included in the show was a noble attempt to acknowledge               recent political history, on the other they a) disastrously suggested               that such political art was merely one approach among many others               (such as the &#8220;neo-gothic&#8221; tendency that has been much               discussed) and b) in the case of the <em>Peace Tower</em> reconstruction,               overseen by Rirkrit Tiravanija and Mark di Suvero, the 1960s are               problematically positioned as a precursor to our own era, suggesting               that artistic strategies of protest for that moment can simply be               revived now, an ironically <em>ahistorical</em> way of viewing the               history of political art as a kind of unchanging, ongoing protest.               For more on openly political art in the 1960s and 1970s, see Therese               Schwartz, &#8220;The Politicization of the Avant-Garde, Parts I-III,&#8221;               <em>Art in America</em>, vols. 59 (pp. 97-105), 60 (pp. 70-79),               &amp; 61 (pp. 67-71).

In this essay, which I do not have time to go               into here, Foster is addressing in part the host of contemporary               artistic practices that engage the art of the 1960s and 1970s spectrally,               among them those working with deliberately obsolete technologies               such as Stan Douglas, or those engaging social experience as a medium,               such as Rirkrit Tirivanija. Obviously he is valuating those artists               who demonstrate this historical awareness in their work.<br>              [20] <em>Art Since 1900</em>, discussed in this section as the present               manifestation of the Octoberite specter, is not without precedent;               in the 1990s former Art &amp; Language member Charles Harrison and               others published a series of texts on modernism intended to provide               a missing critical perspective on the introductory level. See Francis               Frascina, Tamar Garb, Nigel Blake, and Briony Fer, <em>Modernity               and Modernism: French Painting in the Nineteenth Century</em>, Gill               Perry, Francis Frascina, and Charles Harrison, <em>Primitivism,               Cubism, Abstraction: The Early Twentieth Century</em>, David Batchelor,               Paul Wood, and Briony Fer, <em>Realism, Rationalism, Surrealism:               Art Between the Wars</em>, and Jonathan Harris, Francis Frascina,               Charles Harrison, and Paul Wood, <em>Modernism in Dispute: Art Since               the Forties</em> (all New Haven and London: Yale University Press               in association with The Open University, 1993). Clair Bishop noted               that Krauss dismissed the Open University series in a roundtable               related to <em>Art Since 1900</em> at the Tate Modern in April 2005:               &#8220;The fireworks finally arrived when someone from the Open               University asked if the book was meant as a riposte to the OU&#8217;s               own textbooks on twentieth-century art. Krauss tried to unravel               their different understandings of modernism and theory and the implications               of each for pedagogy but concluded: &#8216;Those OU books are inept               and confusing, voil&agrave;!&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="http://artforum.com/diary/id=8733" class="link_underline">http://artforum.com/diary/id=8733</a>).               In addition, the Whitney Museum of American Art&#8217;s Independent               Study Program has since the late 1970s strived to disseminate politically               charged art and theory to a variety of practitioners (artists, curators,               and art historians alike). The Octoberites themselves have also               consistently self-anthologized, first with books cataloguing the               &#8220;best&#8221; of their first two decades (the book related               to the first decade is tellingly discontinued) and later with the               <em>October Files</em> books on individual artists. <br>              [21] One counter to the Octoberite blend of criticism and art history               has been mere reportage&#8212;rigorous archival work that takes               for granted that the art being discussed is of interest and that               any additional historical detail is useful and in fact the substance               of art history. Such a position, however, which I have heard advocated               many times at the Graduate Center, is in its own way a specter,               an argument for a particular orientation toward the past that denies               the usefulness of close reading and/or critical theory. Here perhaps               Nietzsche&#8217;s legendary 1873 essay &#8220;On the Use and Abuse               of History for Life&#8221; (<a href="http://www.mala.bc.ca/%7EJohnstoi/Nietzsche/history.htm" class="link_underline">http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/Nietzsche/history.htm</a>),               which demands that the historian take up the burden of determining               what in history is actually relevant for the present, and not simply               interesting for its own sake, might prove instructive. <br>              [22] See Romy Golan&#8217;s contribution to the <em>Art Bulletin</em>               reviews of <em>Art Since 1900</em> (link above in note [6]).<br>              [23] Ibid, Pamela Lee&#8217;s review.<br>              [24] Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Benjamin H.D.

The Octoberites have               had a longstanding tradition of roundtables which are very useful               to read for an understanding of the particular take that each has               on a given question.
