From the Neo-Impressionist belief that formally innovative               works have a politically transformative effect on their viewers               to Wassily Kandinsky&#8217;s promotion of the idea of the artist               as a spiritual leader in a time of political upheaval, such claims               have formed an important part of the avant-garde posture from the               1880s onwards. They have rarely been subjected to any test of accountability,               however, and on the few occasions when they have, the results have               not been impressive. Futurism molded itself to the priorities of               Fascism rather than shaping Fascist policy, and the Surrealists&#8217;               flirtation with the French Communist Party in the late 1920s was               short-lived. </p>            <p class="second">Indeed, modern art&#8217;s emphasis on continuous               formal innovation, and the resulting inaccessibility of its products               to a non-specialist audience, meant that it was inherently unsuited               to addressing a wider public, as genuinely political art must surely               do. Furthermore, the emergence of modern art was linked, from the               beginning, to the growth of the art market, which allowed artists               to make a living producing works that did not meet the requirements               of traditional state and church patronage. Their dependence on the               art market tied modern artists to an upper-middle-class clientele               by what Clement Greenberg elegantly described as an &#8220;umbilical               cord of gold.&#8221; [1] This limited their ability to contest conservative               capitalist systems from a left-wing position&#8212;a significant               limitation since, with the exception of the Futurists, all modern               artists who expressed a commitment to the political positioned themselves               on the left. At the same time, left-wing artists who sought to make               their work politically effective in the late nineteenth and early               twentieth centuries by aligning themselves with the workers&#8217;               movement, and who therefore worked in a realist style expressly               intended to be accessible to those unfamiliar with contemporary               developments, were for the most part branded as artistically retrograde.               As a result of their aesthetic marginalization, the history of these               artists and their work largely remains to be written. [2]</p>            <p class="second">At the beginning of the 1930s, the situation appeared               to be intractable: modern artists made claims to political effectiveness               that they were unable to validate, while realist artists fell short               of achieving artistic recognition. In France, the Great Depression               temporarily disrupted these established positions, and opened, or               appeared to open, the possibility of an artistic middle ground that               combined a commitment to formal innovation with an interest in making               politically effective art. This paper investigates the specific               conditions that led to the temporary closing of the gulf between               modernists and realists in France, and analyzes the different types               of response that these conditions provoked.</p>            <p class="second">Before the onset of the Depression, which affected               the French economy from 1931 onwards, the market for modern art               in Europe had enjoyed more or less sustained growth since the late               1880s. In France, the growth of the market at the end of the nineteenth               century freed artists from their former dependence on state support               and encouraged a culture of self-conscious artistic independence.               The market remained strong throughout the first three decades of               the twentieth century, fostering an economically and socially self-contained               community of artists, dealers, critics and collectors. By the second               half of the 1920s, modern art had decisively outstripped traditional               forms in terms of market popularity. Accordingly, prices for works               by traditional artists remained relatively flat during the decade,               while those for modern works saw often-dramatic increases, prompting               widespread discussion in the art press of the effects of speculative               investment in modern art on artists and their work. [3]</p>            <p class="second">The Depression and the resulting collapse of the               Paris art market had a devastating effect on this community. All               but the most established artists experienced significant financial               difficulties, and in many cases these difficulties caused them to               question their dependence on a group of sympathizers that was both               numerically and socially very restricted. Many expressed an interest               in exchanging their hard-won independence for renewed social and               political engagement, feeling that the closed circuit of production               and consumption that marked the 1920s had driven a wedge between               them and the broader public. These fundamental changes in the way               modern artists perceived themselves and their social role were accompanied               by a considerable quantity of public soul-searching, which allows               us to trace changing attitudes with some precision. In 1935, in               the depths of the Depression, members of the <em>Association des               Ecrivains et des Artistes R&eacute;volutionnaires</em> (Association               of Revolutionary Writers and Artists; AEAR), an anti-Fascist group               linked to the Paris branch of the <em>Maison de la Culture</em>,               a cultural center run by the French Communist Party, conducted a               survey of artists&#8217; attitudes. The survey was published under               the title &#8220;O&ugrave; Va la Peinture?&#8221; (Where is Painting               Going?) in the May and June 1935 issues of <em>Commune</em>, a journal               produced by the AEAR. Three debates investigating similar issues               were then held at the <em>Maison de la Culture</em> in 1936, the               first two of which were quickly published as a book titled <em>La               Querelle du R&eacute;alisme (The Argument over Realism)</em>. </p>            <p class="second">A significant majority of the participants in &#8220;O&ugrave;               Va la Peinture?&#8221; and <em>La Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em>               made some reference to the fact that the Depression had pushed them               towards greater social and political engagement. Given the climate               of the period, in which the French government&#8217;s ineffectual               efforts to address the economic crisis had direct social effects               in terms of unemployment, it is often difficult to draw a clear               line in the contributions between explicit political commitment               and more general affirmations of a desire to reconnect with the               public. Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Ozenfant, for example, held that &#8220;any               artist who willingly holds himself above the political and social               <em>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</em>, believing that this gives him some               kind of an advantage, is in fact depriving himself of any chance               of being in tune with his times&#8221; [4], making no real distinction               between the social and the political. Overall, though, the sense               that it was time for modern artists to break down the barriers that               had grown up between them and the wider public was very strong,               and in the hands of certain artists it was couched in specifically               political terms.</p>            <p class="second">Ideas about the forms that this renewed social and               political commitment should take varied widely between artists,               however. The widest gulf was between those who believed that sufficiently               radical formal innovations could have a concrete political effect               in their own right, and the growing numbers who held that any meaningful               political or social commitment must be accompanied by two things:               relevant content and a form sufficiently legible for uninitiated               viewers to be able to comprehend the work. The first position was               most articulately propounded by an artist who had been arguing this               line since the 1890s, the long-time anarcho-communist Paul Signac.               As early as 1891, Signac had written that &#8220;[the revolutionary]               tendency is encountered much more strongly among the pure aesthetes,               revolutionaries by temperament, who, striking off the beaten path,               paint what they see, as they feel it, and very often unconsciously               supply a solid axe-blow to the creaking social edifice.&#8221; [5]               His point of view had not changed significantly by 1935, when he               continued to assert the importance of form and color over that of               subject matter&#8212;even in the face of some vigorous questioning               from the organizers of &#8220;O&ugrave; Va la Peinture?&#8221; In               terms of efficacy, Signac&#8217;s position seems doubly questionable.               For the anarcho-communism he espoused, a vital political force in               France in the 1890s, had become increasingly marginalized during               the early twentieth century, losing out to the more organized structures               of Socialism and Communism, and his Neo-Impressionist style, radical               in the 1890s, could no longer be held to be progressive by the time               of the Great Depression.</p>            <p class="second">A position related to Signac&#8217;s, combining               political commitment with reluctance to embrace a return to identifiable,               topical subject matter, was advanced by several artists with links               to Surrealism, including Christian B&eacute;rard, Ren&eacute; Mend&egrave;s-France               and Yves Tanguy; it was most elegantly expressed by Max Ernst&#8217;s               metaphor:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second"> Before he goes down, no deep-sea diver knows                 what he will bring back. Similarly, the painter does not choose                 his subject. To impose one on himself&#8212;however subversive                 or exalting it might be&#8212;and to treat it in an academic manner                 will end up producing a work of feeble revolutionary scope [...]                 the ideological content&#8212;manifest or latent&#8212;cannot                 depend on the conscious will of the painter. [6]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Given the Surrealists&#8217; emphasis on the unconscious               as the most important source for the content of their art, the resistance               to predetermined subject matter is predictable. It is worth considering,               however, that the traditional Surrealist belief in the revolutionary               potential of an art derived from the unconscious was the subject               of vigorous debate in the late 1920s and early 1930s, specifically               because certain members of the group questioned its efficacy. The               debate focused on the relationship between Surrealism and the French               Communist Party (PCF), with some arguing that affiliation with the               Party was a precondition of effective political action, others that               it represented an unacceptable constraint on artistic freedom.</p>            <p class="second">The Surrealists as a group had committed themselves               to a revolutionary posture in a 1925 Declaration by the <em>Bureau               de Recherches Surr&eacute;alistes</em>, and they began to contribute               to the Communist journal <em>Clart&eacute;</em> later the same year.               In 1927, Andr&eacute; Breton, the leader of the group, published               the manifesto <em>Au Grand Jour</em>, which came out strongly in               favor of the PCF, and in 1928, those who refused to join the Party               were expelled from the Surrealist movement. This was the moment               of closest engagement between the Surrealists and the PCF, since               in 1929 Breton rejected Stalinism in the <em>Second Surrealist Manifesto</em>.               Breton then struggled to find an accommodation with the orthodox               Communism of the PCF, and eventually broke completely with the Party               in 1933. Louis Aragon, another important early member of the Surrealist               group, followed a very different trajectory. He continued to be               engaged with the PCF throughout the early 1930s, attended the first               Congress of Soviet Writers in Moscow in August and September of               1934 (the conference at which Andrei Zhdanov set out the policy               of Socialist Realism) and published his realist novel <em>Les Cloches               de B&acirc;le</em> in the same year. Aragon was also an influential               figure at the Communist-sponsored <em>Maison de la Culture</em>               in Paris, one of the main organizers of the Communist-inspired <em>Congr&egrave;s               International des Ecrivains pour la D&eacute;fense de la Culture</em>               (International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture) in               1935, and a contributor to both published debates in the <em>Querelle               du R&eacute;alisme</em>.</p>            <p class="second">In his contribution to the first debate, Aragon               expressed a clear vision of the type of realism he believed was               the most appropriate response to the economic and political circumstances               of the period: &#8220;This realism will no longer be dominated by               nature&#8212;in other words it will not be naturalism&#8212;but               will be a conscious expression of social realities and an integral               part of the struggle to modify those realities. In a word, it will               be a socialist realism...&#8221; [7] In line with his endorsement               of the Soviet model, Aragon was critical both of Signac&#8217;s               emphasis on formal radicalism and of the Surrealist dependence on               the subconscious. In the first debate he launched an attack on the               formalism into which modern artists had retreated:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">They desired less and less that their painting                 should represent something, should signify. They drowned themselves                 in the delectation of manner and material. They lost themselves                 in abstraction. Nothing human remained in their canvases. They                 were happy to become demonstrators of technical problems of painting.                 [8]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">Then in the second debate, in an obvious stab at               the Surrealists, he noted: &#8220;Now you are unhappy that great               social upheavals are disturbing the calmness of your chimeras and               the languor of your visual meditations.&#8221; [9]</p>            <p class="second">The party-line Communist Aragon, however, was not               the only contributor to the <em>Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em>               who doubted the political effectiveness of art that was only radical               in the formal sense. Edouard Goerg had studied before the First               World War with Maurice Denis and Paul S&eacute;rusier&#8212;both               of whom had come to prominence in the 1890s as part of the Nabis               group&#8212;and later been influenced by George Grosz&#8217;s highly               politicized brand of Expressionism. Goerg emphasized the link between               the formal focus of artistic practice in the 1920s and the social               isolation of the modern artist:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">...the technical and plastic researches to which                 the painter [...] was led have condemned him, by their very nature,                 to a reinforced isolation, to working in seclusion on a terrain                 prepared in advance. He thus limits himself to the exercise of                 his means as a painter instead of making the use of them that                 his human nature invites him to. He will say that in the end only                 the painter&#8217;s reality matters to the painter and that the                 world does not extend beyond light, form and color, fooling himself                 about the mastery of his means, which he sees as an end in itself.                 [10]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The reference to classic modernist theory is quite               direct here: it is clear that Goerg was thoroughly conversant with               the emphasis on formal properties over subject matter that had underpinned               the development of modern painting since the turn of the century,               and saw it as lying at the root of the sense of ineffectuality artists               were experiencing during the Depression. </p>            <p class="second">The Depression, then, gave rise to a critique of               the formalism of modern art during the preceding decades, a formalism               that had steadily eroded art&#8217;s social and political functions.               The solution most commonly proposed in the context of &#8220;O&ugrave;               va la Peinture?&#8221; and <em>La Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em>,               significantly outweighing the positions represented by Signac and               the Surrealists, was to produce a more accessible art, dealing with               topical subjects and capable of engaging wider audiences. It would               be a mistake, however, to imagine that such opinions represented               an unquestioning embrace of realism. The majority of contributors               were veterans of modern art&#8217;s efforts to distance itself from               the sentimental and anecdotal forms of realism by now associated               with academic painting. For this reason, the exponents of a more               engaged art spent as much time specifying what aspects of realism               they were determined to avoid as they did outlining the forms they               thought it should take. Jean Lur&ccedil;at, whose work of the 1930s               was indebted to Surrealism but who had previously worked in a style               informed by Cubism, pointed out that &#8220;The painter is not just               a recording machine&#8221; and launched an appeal not to &#8220;start               the naturalist experience over without moving things forward&#8221;               [11]. Edouard Goerg, in his comments on the social isolation of               the artist who restricted himself to formal investigations, remarked               that nonetheless &#8220;the painter [...] never finds ready-made               canvases in nature, apt to be cut out and put in a frame.&#8221;               [12]</p>            <p class="second">Motivation to avoid the most transparent forms of               realism came not just from the taint of academicism that such forms               carried but also from the fact that by the middle of the 1930s they               were developing even uglier associations. Since the National Socialists               took power in Germany in 1933, they had been encouraging the production               of an art that was figurative in style and reactionary in content;               an initiative accompanied by an increasingly strident rejection               of modern art. In the Soviet Union, the enthusiasm for modern art               that followed the 1917 Revolution had been eroded during the 1920s               and was decisively supplanted in 1934 by the official imposition               of Socialist Realism, a style believed to be more effective at communicating               the aims of the regime. </p>            <p class="second">One might expect that the artists of the <em>Maison               de la Culture</em>, drawn to the organization by its anti-Fascist               platform, would have wanted to distance themselves most clearly               from the German version of realism. In practice, however, there               is almost no mention of this subject in &#8220;O&ugrave; va la Peinture?&#8221;               and <em>La Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em>. What loomed much larger               was the suspicion among modern artists that they might eventually               be pressured to adopt the Soviet model. This was largely because               the <em>Maison</em> was run by the French Communist Party, which               wielded considerable influence over cultural policy as a key participant               in the recently elected left-wing coalition government known as               the Popular Front. Aragon&#8217;s contribution to the first <em>Querelle</em>               debate, cited above, can only have added to artists&#8217; concerns.               In practice, however, Aragon was almost completely isolated in the               debates. The artists he was addressing were simply not prepared               to give up their hard-won freedom to transform the subjects they               depicted in the pursuit of greater expressiveness, and, for all               their interest in greater social and political engagement, they               were loathe to have their approaches dictated by politicians. </p>            <p class="second">Against this background, the contribution made to               the second debate by Jean Cassou, a Communist poet and art critic               speaking in his capacity as the newly appointed liaison between               the Ministry of Education and the Fine Arts Administration, was               a masterpiece of double-talk. Committed to promoting the Communist               line but clearly cognizant of the concerns evinced by a majority               of the artists present, Cassou chose to elaborate on the concepts               of &#8220;obligation&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221; in art:</p>            <blockquote>               <p class="second">Obligation. It seems to me that artists are frightened                 that in tomorrow&#8217;s society, the society which will begin                 with the dictatorship of the proletariat, they will be made to                 submit to specific obligations. I&#8217;d like to study the concept                 of obligation more closely here, since at the moment its nature                 is a little confused. If I understand the idea people have of                 it, a rather fantastic idea, obligation would apply to the subject                 matter of our future creations. Speaking for myself, I want to                 tell you that I don&#8217;t share any of these pathological fears.                 I don&#8217;t believe anyone can oblige me to treat a particular                 subject in my literary work [...]</p>              <p class="second">I can only express a reality with which I feel                 complete solidarity. As a result, if you truly feel solidarity                 for the reality which is preparing itself as we speak and which                 will constitute tomorrow&#8217;s world, I mean if you have really                 achieved consciousness of your revolutionary state, you will quite                 naturally express this revolutionary reality [in your works].                 And there will be no need to impose any kind of obligation on                 you and your creations. [13]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">The implausible lengths to which Cassou went to               try and justify the coercive effects of the policy of Socialist               Realism&#8212;and we should make no mistake that Socialist Realism,               with the extensive apparatus of state control and predefined subject               matter it entailed, lies behind his remarks&#8212;indicate that               he understood how vigorously French artists would resist any Soviet-style               interference in their work, even as they went in search of greater               political effectiveness. </p>            <p class="second">Indeed, what many of the artists who participated               in the <em>Maison de la Culture</em> were seeking was a middle ground,               a position somewhere between politically ineffectual formalism and               ideologically subservient realism that would allow them to reconnect               with a wider public on the terrain of topical and legible subject               matter without entirely giving up the formal innovations pioneered               by modern artists. Thus Ozenfant suggested </p>            <blockquote>              <p class="second">We owe important works to the Impressionists,                 Fauves, Cubists, Constructivists, abstract artists, works that                 were very much of their time and constitute admirable <em>inventories                 of the means of art</em>. Certainly, we must always experiment&#8212;but                 not do nothing but that! [...] The time is passing when we used                 to worry above all about being revolutionary in <em>form</em>,                 in the means of expression; it is highly likely that a time is                 coming when we will devote ourselves to being revolutionary in                 spirit and will express ourselves in a more open way, though not                 forgetting the achievements of the avant-garde. It is enough to                 say that works will have <em>subjects</em>, the necessary areas                 of agreement between artists and the public. [14]</p>            </blockquote>            <p class="second">He did not, however, provide any real details of               what this new art would look like. Only two artists got down to               the nuts and bolts of describing what form it might take. Goerg,               whose critiques of formalism and reservations about transparent               realism I have cited above, actually laid out a blueprint for the               artistic process in his contribution to the second debate. He started               by suggesting there are two forms of realism. The first involves               disinterested observation of the world; the second, which he favored,               requires the artist to &#8220;take a stand facing reality&#8221;               [15], and obliges him to find a subject that engages his emotions               and resonates with other human beings. The artist then laid out               the precise steps for transforming this subject into a work of art,               with an initial process of abstracting from the motif followed by               a selection and organization of pictorial elements designed to enhance               their expressive aspects and improve the overall visual coherency               of the work. </p>            <p class="second">Goerg was trying to map a middle path between formalism               and abstraction on the one hand and naive realism on the other,               aiming for an art that could resonate with non-specialist audiences               without being stylistically regressive. During the 1930s, he practiced               what he preached, working on a series titled &#8220;Ainsi va le               monde sous l&#8217;oeil de la police&#8221; (&#8220;So goes the               world under the eye of the police&#8221;) in response to the rising               tide of political oppression in Europe. Any systematic assessment               of his achievement as a political artist is rendered very difficult,               however, by the relative obscurity in which he worked for much of               his career. If an artist&#8217;s political effectiveness is determined               as much by their public profile as by the level of commitment exemplified               in their works, then his impact was clearly limited.</p>            <p class="second">No such qualifications need be offered for the second               artist who put forward a model for an art that could communicate               effectively. Fernand L&eacute;ger was acknowledged as a leading               modern artist, in France and internationally, between the wars,               and his continuing status is evidenced by the heavyweight retrospectives               he has been accorded in recent years. [16] In &#8220;O&ugrave; va               la Peinture?&#8221; he proposed that the artist could bridge the               gap between recent innovations in painting and a non-specialist               audience by focusing on the modern object. He developed this argument               in a talk titled &#8220;Le nouveau r&eacute;alisme continue&#8221;               (The New Realism Goes On) in the second <em>Querelle</em> debate,               suggesting that each epoch has its own version of realism and that               the technological advancements of the modern age demand &#8220;a               new realism, quite different from earlier plastic conceptions.&#8221;               [17] L&eacute;ger dates the origins of the &#8216;new realism&#8217;               to Impressionism, and admits that it has not reached a wider audience               because it has traditionally been the preserve of dealers and collectors.               He goes on to argue, however, that this is no reason to return to               past styles. To do so would be to &#8220;... insult these completely               new men, who desire only to understand and to go forward; it is               to decree them incapable of rising to this new realism which is               of their epoch, the one in which they live and work, and which they               have created with their own hands.&#8221; [18] Artists, L&eacute;ger               goes on to say, should forge ahead with the new realism, especially               in the form of collective mural projects that renew the pre-Renaissance               tradition of a truly popular art.</p>            <p class="second">In terms of converting theory into practice, however,               there was a significant problem with the ideas L&eacute;ger was               putting forward. He admitted in his talk at the <em>Maison de la               Culture</em> that the present limitation of modern art&#8217;s audience               to a relatively small group of initiates was a product of the &#8220;current               social order,&#8221; and that only a &#8220;social evolution&#8221;               would allow ordinary people access to this art. [19] It seems he               was thinking not so much of a revolution along traditional Marxist               lines as of the changes he anticipated the new Popular Front government               would bring, since he stressed the importance of increased leisure               time&#8212;a key element of the Popular Front platform&#8212;as               the basis for establishing new audiences for his new realism. The               Popular Front&#8217;s tenure turned out to be rather short, though,               and a number of the socially progressive measures it instituted               were partially rolled back after its final dissolution in April               1938. Thus the social evolution L&eacute;ger envisaged never really               took place, and his dream that modern forms would be widely understood               and endorsed was not realized. [20]</p>            <p class="second">Although L&eacute;ger himself continued to develop               a clearly figurative but identifiably modern style that he hoped               would communicate his faith in social progress, after World War               Two he was in a minority. The historical moment during which a significant               number of artists could imagine an art that split the difference               between modernist hermeticism and naive realism, and thereby achieve               political effectiveness, did not last long. In the second half of               the 1930s Germany and the Soviet Union intensified their efforts               to develop transparent forms of realism with maximum ideological               impact while systematically excluding and oppressing modern artists.               The totalitarian instrumentalization of art frightened off many               of the modern artists who had been motivated to reintroduce legible               subject matter into their art, because it established an ever more               direct link between realism and political authority over the artistic               sphere. By 1938, Paris had essentially returned to the pre-Depression               status quo: modern artists made claims to political commitment but               refused to be held accountable for the effectiveness of their works,               and artists who measured their political commitment in terms of               party membership were increasingly pressured to produce transparently               realist works. These respective positions were exemplified by the               two leading lights of 1920s Surrealism. Louis Aragon continued to               promote the Communist party line, advocating Socialist Realism in               literature and the visual arts, whilst Andr&eacute; Breton co-authored,               with Diego Rivera and Leon Trotsky, the manifesto &#8220;Towards               a Free Revolutionary Art,&#8221; which argued&#8212;under the slogan               &#8220;complete freedom for art&#8221;&#8212;that revolutionary               art cannot be accountable to any political party or regime. [21]               As Europe moved towards war, political and aesthetic positions hardened,               and in the process the vision of an art combining formal innovation               with political effectiveness was lost. The middle ground had been               squeezed out.</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Toby Norris</strong> is Assistant Professor               of Art History at Assumption College, Worcester, Massachusetts.               He completed the dissertation Modern Artists and the State in France               Between the Two World Wars at Northwestern University in December               2005.

Il dira alors qu&#8217;en fin de compte la r&eacute;alit&eacute;               du peintre seule importe au peintre, et que le monde se borne &agrave;               la lumi&egrave;re, &agrave; la forme, &agrave; la couleur, s&#8217;illusionnant               sur l&#8217;usage de ses moyens, qu&#8217;il envisage comme un fin.&#8221;               From <em>La Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em> (Paris, 1936), 43<br>              [11] &#8220;Le peintre n&#8217;est pas seulement un appareil enregistreur&#8221;;               &#8220;Eviter la peinture pure pour tomber dans cet autre exc&egrave;s               que pourrait &ecirc;tre &#8216;le spectacle pour le spectacle&#8217;               [...] ce serait recommencer l&#8217;exp&eacute;rience naturaliste               sans faire avancer les choses,&#8221; from <em>La Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em>               (Paris, 1936), 18.<br>              [12] &#8220;le peintre [...] ne trouve jamais dans la r&eacute;alit&eacute;               de tableaux tout faits, pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; &ecirc;tre d&eacute;coup&eacute;s               proprement et mis en cadre&#8221; From <em>La Querelle du R&eacute;alisme</em>               (Paris, 1936), 44.<br>              [13] &#8220;Obligation.

Je               voudrais ici que nous serrions cette notion d&#8217;obligation.               Car elle n&#8217;a, pour le moment, qu&#8217;un caract&egrave;re               assez confus. Si je comprends bien l&#8217;image qu&#8217;on s&#8217;en               fait et qui est quelque chose d&#8217;un peu fantomatique, cette               obligation s&#8217;appliquerait au sujet de nos cr&eacute;ations               futures. Pour ma part, je veux vous dire que je n&#8217;&eacute;prouve               aucune de ces craintes paniques. Je ne crois pas qu&#8217;on puisse               m&#8217;obliger &agrave; faire porter mes recherches litt&eacute;raires               sur tel ou tel sujet [...] Je ne peux exprimer que [cette r&eacute;alit&eacute;]               dont je me sens intimement solidaire.

Et il n&#8217;y aura               nul besoin de fair agir sur vous et sur vos cr&eacute;ations aucune               esp&egrave;ce d&#8217;obligation.&#8221; From <em>La Querelle du               R&eacute;alisme</em> (Paris, 1936) 126-27.<br>              [14] &#8220;Nous devons aux impressionistes, fauves, cubistes, constructivistes,               abstraits, des oeuvres importantes qui furent bien de leur temps               et qui constituent d&#8217;admirables inventaires des moyens de               l&#8217;art.
