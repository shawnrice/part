With the thriving movie industry of Mumbai               and the growing international attention to literary works emerging               from India, researchers often overlook other significant artistic               production that, while less popular or economically viable, frequently               serves as a vehicle for social change. </p>            <p class="second">Previous work on the queer community in India falls               into a number of different categories&#8212;narratives, historical               and mythological positioning, political struggles and movements,               and cinematic and artistic representations. The emerging queer narratives               in the form of anthologies (Ratti 1993, Sukthankar 1999) recount               &#8220;coming out,&#8221; portray familial pressures and societal               constraints and ultimately give a broader understanding of the personal               and internal struggle that members of the community endure. Research               in the fields of historical and mythological references (Vanita               and Kidwai 2001, Thandini 1997) explores incidences of same-sex               love throughout India. These authors trace mortal and divine same-sex               relationships through Indian literature and scriptures to enlighten               mainstream Indian society about its own erotic past in hopes of               diminishing contemporary stereotypes associated with same-sex love.               These books, however, have been largely confined to the academic               domain and have failed to reach the broader audiences. Political               and social movements and histories have been recorded in works including               <em>Queer: Despised Sexuality, Law and Social Change</em> (Narrain               2004), <em>Humjinsi: A Recourse Book for Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual               Rights in India</em> (Fernandez 2002) and <em>Because I have a Voice</em>               (Narrain and Bham 2005). These books collectively recall the social               restraints facing the queer communities, with a particular focus               on how law and the legal system inherently oppose sexual diversity               and hinder open discussions of sexuality. </p>            <p class="second">Notable endeavors in cinematic and art historical               research also discuss India&#8217;s queer community. Deepa Mehta&#8217;s               1997 film &#8220;Fire&#8221; depicts the intimate relationship between               two married women, while Onir&#8217;s 2005 film &#8220;My Brother               Nikhil&#8221; portrays the difficult situation of a gay man &#8220;coming               out&#8221; to his parents about his sexuality and his HIV positive               status. Other research on the emergence of queer art has been focused               on the openly gay artist Bhuphen Khakar (Devy 2001, Panikkar 2004)               and his attempt to &#8220;normalize&#8221; homosexuality through               art. While such works uncover the hidden angst of this ignored community               and increase the awareness of its existence, the research encompassing               queer performance art and theatrical productions remains derisory.</p>            <p class="second">This paper will link the separate strands of contemporary               Indian performance art and queer politics by first analyzing previous               political activism in both art and alternative sexualities, with               specific focus on the historical heart of colonial Indian art, Kolkata.               Understanding past political positioning of art in India, as well               as the legal issues of the queer community and the laws that directly               affect them, gives insight into the contemporary identity and politics               surrounding the community and its relation to art. Grasping these               political ideologies of the queer community in Kolkata is integral               in comprehending the community&#8217;s structure and its artistic               goals. The paper will then analyze two major plays by Kolkata-based               performance group Sapphire Creations Dance company, <em>The Alien               Flower</em> (1996), India&#8217;s first full-length ballet on homosexual               love and <em>Positive Lives</em> (2004), a performance utilizing               wide varieties of dances styles against the backdrop of photographs               and narratives of HIV positive patients. The analysis of these performances               suggests how the queer movement has developed more nuanced techniques               for activism; in particular, how it uses performative resistance               to educate the audience about the community&#8217;s views on sexuality               and stereotypes and how they battle against keeping sexual identities               hidden under the blanket of staunch heteronormativity and strict               sexual policing in Indian society.</p>            <p class="second">Kolkata has a long history of intersections between               culture and political activism, and provides an interesting starting               point for examining artistic activism in a queer context. An integral               player in the anti-colonial movements against the British, Kolkata&#8217;s               national movement in British India began in the 1890&#8217;s and               employed art as a means to recreate its vision of a purely Indian               identity in a colonial environment. As the first capital of British               India and the birthplace of the Indian national flag,[1] Kolkata               was the prime place to &#8220;recover and rebuild a taste for &#8216;art.&#8217;&#8221;[2]               This recreation of an artistic identity was essential to Kolkata&#8217;s               aspirations for self-improvement, modernization and leadership.[3]               In 1889, the establishment of the Calcutta School of Art, whose               art is known as the Bengali School, became the center for this emerging               Indian identity. Established by EB Havell, the British principal               of the school, and AK Coomaraswamy, the school encouraged young               artists to create a more nuanced Indian aesthetic and refrain from               mimicking modernist works of Western artists such as Picasso and               Gauguin. </p>            <p class="second">The Bengali School of Art taught what scholar Tapati               Guha-Tarkurta calls a &#8220;new Orientalism&#8221;[4] in painting.               Striving to reject the idea of Western art practices in Indian institutions,               this artistic revival carved a space for &#8220;high art&#8221;               in India and reclaimed the lost &#8220;Indian style,&#8221; which               was regarded as a highly aesthetic portrayal of spirituality. Havell               pioneered this &#8220;Indian defense&#8221; aimed at restoring the               spirituality and idealism lost from Indian art during the colonial               period.[5] Yet the Bengali School&#8217;s construction of a new               artistic Indian identity raises many questions about the ultimate               influence of the West in postcolonial India. As a British art critic               and teacher, Havell held a powerful and privileged position, helping               to construct the Indian art school and guiding Bengali artists in               their creation of an Indian identity. Furthermore, the very idea               of &#8220;high art&#8221; and &#8220;new Orientalism&#8221; are               distinct results of Western influence on Indian art theory. Therefore,               even though Havell tried to reject Western artistic traits, his               notions of Indian art, in the end, were heavily influenced and defined               by his Western training. Because of this, Havell influenced how               Indian identity would be characterized and portrayed, with lasting               results in the Bengali School. </p>            <p class="second">Guha-Thakurta has suggested that by 1910 the &#8220;new               Orientalist&#8221; discourse &#8220;was not only reasserting the               glorious past of Indian art, but also attributing it with a present-day               &#8216;national&#8217; identity.&#8221;[6] The success of this movement               remains contestable, however, as the new &#8220;modernist&#8221;               artists, including Amrita Sher-Gil and the Bombay Progressives,[7]               rejected this idealism in Indian art in the 1920&#8217;s and 1930&#8217;s.               Yet despite evident debates around generalized characteristics of               &#8220;Indian&#8221; and &#8220;Western&#8221; art, the fact that               Kolkata used art to create a new Indian identity is important to               its identity as a socially charged environment. This environment               is still alive today through the lasting efforts of Kolkata-born               political activist and poet Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), who               established Shantiniketan in 1921, in an attempt to give Indian               students a broader education with an increased social awareness.             </p>            <p class="second">Just as the national movement in Kolkata during               the early 1900&#8217;s battled to establish an &#8220;exclusive               space for &#8216;high art&#8217;&#8221;[8] and a new identity for               India, the queer movement also employs the idea of art as a form               of protest to counteract the opposing mainstream views on sexuality.               In Kolkata, specifically, this movement against conventional views               on sexuality and HIV positive stereotypes engages with non-normative               methods of resistance. While resistance suggests protests, violence,               or underground movements of political and social opposition, alternate               forms of resistance, such as those utilized by Kolkata performance               artists, use the body and its expressions as a medium to contest               social ideologies. This method of opposition, which will be referred               to as performative resistance, provides for a springboard to discuss               the body and stage as complementary spaces to convey dissension.             </p>            <p class="second">Performative resistance refers to the idea that               activists display their disagreement with mainstream ideologies               to a specific audience through bodily actions and movements. These               body movements are intended to open up a platform for discussion,               convey an opinion or respond to the issues surrounding these ideologies.               While they can be as small as hand and eye movements, they may also               take the form of choreographed actions and full-length performances.               The actual site of resistance is a complex convergence between the               body of the performer and the space and locality of the stage: relative               micro- and macro- spaces that feed into and contextualize one another.               The movements and intentions of the body/bodies legitimate the stage               as a performative space and can transform its &#8220;blank slate&#8221;               into one with an inherent political charge. In tandem, the authority               of the stage as a cultural center commands the audiences&#8217;               attention, thus activating the body. </p>            <p class="second">This union of the body as an object to express resistance               and the stage as the site where resistance is expressed is important               for understanding how these performances in Kolkata are organized               and created. Given the circular nature of this relationship, the               body and stage can move from serving purely as vessels for the expression               of political ideas to being proactive sites with specific agendas               for combating political and social ideologies. </p>            <p class="second">The Kolkata queer movement uses performative resistance               to corporeally convey its opposition to mainstream ideologies through               the performances of the Sapphire Creations dance company. Founded               in 1992 by choreographer Sudarshan Chakraborty, the Kolkata-based               group aims to &#8220;integrate an awareness of tradition in dance&#8230;[they]               have an urge to entertain and a purpose to provoke consciousness.&#8221;[9]               Compared to the more classical performances seen in Kolkata, the               dance company creates unusual, theatrically unique pieces. Using               fusions of music, poetry and prose as soundtracks for the performances,               the group combines various dance forms such as ballet, hip-hop,               Bhangra, classical Indian Bharatnatyam and jazz. Their radical nature               appears most notably when they perform acts that are unspoken taboos               of Indian society, such as having two men engage in an open-mouthed               kiss on stage. Chakraborty further comments that &#8220;I feel that               sexuality and sex is a basic aspect of our existence, and if we               cannot question it, the right, the wrong, the truth&#8230;. lots               of things will remain in the dark. I feel that in India, everything               is hush hush. If the artist community does not bring out these issues               which are wrapped under a blanket, who else will?&#8221;[10]</p>            <p class="second">Understanding the politics behind the queer movement               helps to uncover the reasons artistic activism remains one of the               main avenues the community employs. The state of homosexuality in               India still remains under political attack and social scrutiny.               The last decade of the 20th century saw the emergence of a political               assertion against the private realm of sexuality that has targeted               sexual &#8220;deviation&#8221; in India. This sexual deviation now               targets the &#8220;queer&#8221; community in India and focuses on               the policing of private sexualities of citizens, creating an air               anxiety among queer communities.[11]</p>            <p class="second">The history and politics behind Indian law and the               movement lend themselves to a more specific understanding of the               community&#8217;s contemporary position. Just as British cultural               perceptions had an extensive influence on the role of art in Indian               society and the way art reflects Indian identity, the same influence               is visible in jurisprudence. The long-lasting influence of British               colonial views on sexuality, reverberating primarily through penal               codes, has greatly impacted the political and social mobility of               the Indian queer movement. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code               laid the foundation for the community&#8217;s fight against heteronormativity.               Formulated as part of the Indian Penal Code in 1861, Section 377               states &#8220;any carnal intercourse against the order of nature               with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with a fine, a 10               year sentence or imprisonment for life.&#8221;[12] The law reflected               the patriarchal morality of Victorian England, which condemned oral               and anal sex.[13] This section, however, is rarely used to prosecute               cases of consensual heterosexual sex, but rather, is used to attack,               harass and extort money from men who have sex with men (MSM&#8217;s)               and <em>hijras</em> (transvestites). <em>The Delhi Times</em> writer               Jyoti Sharma, uncovering the ramifications of this section, writes               &#8220;[it] has been used to persecute [the gay] community&#8230;threats               have been used by the police and the goons to extort money from               the gay community.&#8221;[14]</p>            <p class="second">Section 377 has been a catalyst in the queer movement,               propelling activist groups to organize around a common thread of               injustice: to decriminalize consensual adult sexual activity of               any nature. It additionally restricts discussions around sexual               identity, sexuality and homosexuality and increases the anxiety               around activist movements. Shaleen Rakesh of <em>The Times of India</em>               writes that Section 377 &#8220;makes criminals out of innocent men               and boys. It hits at their self-esteem, erodes their self-confidence               and mocks their personal identity.&#8221;[15] While the law was               repealed in Britain in 1967, it is still strongly enforced in parts               of India. For five years NGO&#8217;s, non-profit and queer organizations               prepared a lawsuit against this law for the Delhi High court. Yet               in September 2001, the Delhi High Court dismissed their plea to               revoke Section 377 and the offenses of &#8220;unnatural sex.&#8221;[16]               This national engagement with Section 377 is contemporary India&#8217;s               ongoing link with its heteronormative colonial past. </p>            <p class="second">While Section 377 affects all parts of India, the               development of the queer movement in Kolkata is unique and reflects               more progress than other parts of the country. 1999 ushered the               official &#8220;coming out&#8221; of the public gay movement in               Kolkata when the Integration Society held a &#8220;Friendship Walk,&#8221;               quickly renamed to the &#8220;gay pride march&#8221; the following               year.[17] Led by Rafiquel Haque Dowjah, secretary of the Integration               Society, an organization created to educate Indian society about               homosexuality, it began as a silent march in which fifty gay men               walked through the market streets of Kolkata handing out flowers               to onlookers.[18] Sparking media curiosity, it garnered international               recognition, making Integration Society a leader in the Indian queer               movement. In response to the increase in participants and international               press, the Integration Society changed the name of the celebration               from the &#8220;gay pride march&#8221; to Kolkata&#8217;s &#8220;Rainbow               Festival.&#8221; </p>            <p class="second">One explanation for Kolkata's major successes may               stem from colonial Indian ideas of masculinity and femininity and               their links with contemporary sexuality. Bengali men were often               seen as the &quot;feminine men&quot; of India.[19] Thomas Babington               Macaulay, an Indian Law Member in the 1830&#8217;s, commented, &#8220;the               physical organization of the Bengalee is feeble even to effeminacy&#8230;his               limbs [are] delicate&#8230;during many ages he has been trampled               upon by men of bolder and more hardy breeds.&#8221;[20]</p>            <p class="second">While masculinity during colonial times was often               linked with property and land ownership, the British used corporeal               descriptions of the Bengali men as further evidence of their femininity.               While there was an increase in the number of Bengali gymnasiums               during the 1890's (an attempt to meet the standard of physical masculinity               imposed by the British), the British were convinced of Bengali men's               effeminacy and noted their &quot;feebleness&quot; as a justification               for colonization. Bengali men were therefore exempted from joining               stereotypical &quot;masculine&quot; institutions, such as the army.[21]</p>            <p class="second">Ironically, perhaps the reason for a higher level               of acceptance of alternative sexualities today is the reverse effect               of gender stereotyping. With a history of being judged as effeminate,               Bengali men (more specifically the upper class Bengali men involved               in the queer movement) have used the tolerance towards effeminacy               to help the gay cause. While there is undoubtedly still a reaction               to the stereotype of effeminacy in parts of Bengal, activist circles               and parts of government hold a more relaxed attitude towards sexuality               and do not link &#8220;typical&#8221; representations of manhood               with specific ideas, allowing alternative sexualities the space               to flourish and not be condemned. For example, in Kolkata, Section               377, while still protested, is not fully enforced. Pawan Dahl, director               of the Integration Society, commented, &#8220;Section 377 does not               block the gay movement from moving forward. We have not had as many               arrests, police brutality or hate crimes that we know of, compared               to Delhi.&#8221;[22]</p>            <p class="second">It is necessary to discuss the progress of queer               movement in Kolkata, especially the march, as having a foundation               in Western activism. The westernization of these queer activist               movements in India raises an interesting discussion surrounding               globalization of queer movements. Craig Johnston explores this idea               in his paper &#8220;Social impact assessment of gay hallmark events:               the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.&#8221; According to Johnston               pride marches &#8220;were created by gay activists as part of the               repertoire of the contemporary gay movements&#8230;they are moments               for coming out&#8230;they provide opportunities for cultural expression,               both in the parades and their associated arts festivals.&#8221;[23]               Johnston asserts, however, that there remains a disjuncture for               pride marches in developing nations because they not only negotiate               queer identities but also cultural identities within the realm of               their communities.[24] Therefore, while this increase in pride marches               in developing countries, such as India, suggests an infusion of               Western activist techniques, there still remains a disconnect in               how pride marches are used and performed in specific countries.             </p>            <p class="second">Kolkata&#8217;s gay pride march successfully combined               Indian cultural history with the current Western ideas of queer               activism. Confidently stepping through crowded streets and promptly               stopping traffic, they combine Gandhian principles of peaceful resistance               with the Western idea of a march. The march forces a public acknowledgement               of these alternative sexualities, but doesn&#8217;t mimic the &#8220;march&#8221;               and protest style of loud music, provocative slogans and political               posters such as those seen in gay pride marches of the West. Disobeying               traffic signals, silently demanding attention, forced recognition               of the existence and humanity of queer communities in Kolkata. </p>            <p class="second">The openness of the public setting and the timing               of the march were integral for its success. Because the laws against               homosexual activities force many to conceal their sexual identities,               the group utilized the most public part of the city, the downtown               streets, to reveal their sexuality. In the crowded afternoon streets,               they approached the opposition in a vulnerable state when they could               have been quickly assaulted. Through the simple gesture of handing               out flowers during the march, they conveyed nonviolent principles               of loving their &#8220;opponents&#8221; and essentially created               a hybrid form of queer activism drawing upon both western and Indian               traditions. While the pride marches offer a public space of resistance,               theater and performance both become another activist outlet to educate               a broader population that is often times unaware of the movement.</p>            <p class="second">The development of the Sapphire Creations dance               company reflects the increasing confidence of the queer movement               in Kolkata. In Kolkata &#8220;[the] dance troupe helped set the               stage for a very vocal and loud activist movement,&#8221; Chakravorty               says. &#8220;We&#8217;re not shy at all. We want people to know               about our community and we&#8217;re not afraid of the consequences.&#8221;[25]               The company was founded to decrease social taboos surrounding the               discussion of sexuality and homosexual stereotypes and often found               themselves entangled in the tensions of homophobic Indian society               and apprehensive crowds. Angry protesters ripped down the posters               for the their first ballet piece with a homosexual theme, <em>The               Alien Flower</em>, and insisted that Sapphire take down their &#8220;provocative&#8221;               banner whose headline read &#8220;celebrate your sexuality.&#8221;               The ballet recalled the story of a misunderstood gay man forced               to seek psychiatric help because of his lifestyle. Based on English               poems written by authors Sanjoy Vasa and Pakesh Ratti, the ballet               reproduces these descriptions of same sex-love on stage amidst the               reciting of poetry. <em>India Today</em> columnist Ruben Banerjee&#8217;s               review of the play noted that, &#8220;it deals with the prejudice               facing homosexuals, [and] it also holds out the hope of a more humane               understanding of their sexual orientation.&#8221;[26] Divided into               four main scenes, the ballet goes through the birth and isolation               of the gay child, his marriage search and longing for a partner,               his rejection by society and ultimate death.</p>            <p class="second">The continuous theme of the play remains the protagonist&#8217;s               internal strife and battle against himself and society for acceptance               of homosexuality. In one scene, for example, a group surrounds the               gay protagonist and throws a rope around his neck. Dressed in black               and red, the protagonist struggles to free himself. The leader of               the group, wearing a black mask, stands above the protagonist on               a pedestal to throw the rope around his neck; his knees buckle and               he falls to the ground while the group jeers him. As his body convulses               erratically and jerks sporadically in all directions, the scene               implies the loss of corporeal control for the protagonist; the group               members, however, have controlled and rhythmic choreographed moves               that are performed with detailed hand gestures, fist punches and               kicks. The protagonist is eventually forced into submission. The               obvious message is that society controls the way the homosexual               acts and survives in society&#8212;he is forced into obedience.               This act of struggling against the noose and refusing to be tied               down exemplifies the idea of performative resistance. </p>            <p class="second">In an excerpt of the ballet, the protagonist asks,               &#8220;mummy keeps her jewels in a box full of dreams&#8230;father               waits for the day I bring a crimson bride&#8230;every chapter of               my life written by their hands&#8230;I reach for the pen, will they               understand?&#8221;[27] While society has explicitly conveyed its               stance on homosexuality in the play and forbidden the homosexual               to exist peacefully, familial pressure and opposition compound the               protagonist&#8217;s struggle. The impossibility of the protagonist               bringing home a crimson bride and playing the part written by his               parents is obvious in his gestures during this scene: holding his               head in his hands, he fears his own reality and twists and shudders               as if trying to escape his own existence. This poetic verse insinuates               that larger and wider social acceptance of homosexuality will not               exist without familial support. Suggesting that acceptance starts               on the individual level, the play pleads for audience members and               broader society to see homosexuals as normal.</p>            <p class="second">The finale focuses on the cycle of rebirth and impossibility               of obliterating homosexuality from society. It is an imaginative               sequence in which the group holds a long scarf and surrounds the               protagonist with livid facial expressions and angry bodily gestures               in which they throw their chests forward and kick in the direction               of the protagonist. After he has been strangled, his body is still               only for a moment, because the noose transforms itself into a cradle;               he becomes a newborn child being supported, nurtured and loved.               In this way, the performance ties ideas of reincarnation to homosexuality;               no matter how much society will try to control and constrain sexual               identities, they will still re-emerge. Attempting to educate mainstream               Kolkata that homosexuals should be seen as humans and not as sexual               deviants, the choreographer wanted to show the cycle of life and               death and humanize the lives of the homosexual population, rather               than keep them in the stereotype of &#8220;abnormal creatures.&#8221;               Elucidating the experiences of the queer community through performance,               the company conveyed the helplessness, constraint mockery and hatred               endured by members of an ostracized community. </p>            <p class="second">The dance company tried to further break social               labels attached to homosexuality and queer life in their 2004 dance               performance <em>Positive Lives</em>, inspired by real-life experiences,               anecdotes and case histories of people living with HIV. Set against               the background of Ranjit Sinha&#8217;s photographs of HIV positive               people, the performance employs numerous styles of dance from Bharatnatyam               to Bhangra and hip-hop to modern dance while highlighting the courage               and strength of people living with HIV. The group thus sought to               counter stereotypes of HIV associated with the queer community.             </p>            <p class="second">Organized into five main scenes, <em>Positive Lives</em>               begins by posing the initial question of how to live with HIV. It               explores the manifestation of HIV in the form of a mask&#8212;an               uneven, scaly second skin on the face of the performers. The performers               timidly engage and dance around each other in a slower, almost balletic               performance. Gaining the courage to approach one another and slowly               peel off the mask with wide-eyed curiosity, the scene ends with               a more powerful and erratic dance sequence with confident gestures               and jumps that mirror their newfound strength to live with HIV.             </p>            <p class="second">In another scene, a vertical screen descends and               divides the stage into two separate rooms, each with one dancer.               Reflecting the lack of communication about HIV, the dancers try               to break down this barrier. Even though this black screen separates               the dancers, their movements compliment each other as they rhythmically               turn, twist and jump in synchrony. The two meet in rhythmic glory               as they leap towards each other when the barrier is destroyed via               constant thrashings and violent gestures, and the screen is lifted.               In addition, this act of performative resistance opposes the idea               of living a silent and solitary life with HIV; the scene suggests               the need for an open discourse for people to discuss and learn about               HIV and support each other. </p>            <p class="second">The next scene, featuring a lone female dancer,               explores the pain of the HIV positive mother who experiences both               the joys of motherhood and the stigma and agony of bringing another               infected body into the world. Using a red cloth, symbolic of blood,               fertility and life, to join the mother and the fetus, the dancer               enacts this scene with actions and movements above the stage. Entangled               in this red cloth, tied from either end of the stage and the ceiling,               she falls down in twirling movements and climbs back up the cloth.               Dressed in black, she is entangled in the cloth that hinders her               movements. This symbolically conveys how she is struggling to love               her fetus, but at the same time is fearful of its mere existence.             </p>            <p class="second">Its final scene reverberates with a sense of purpose               as the dancers solemnly march forward from the back of the stage               with intensity in their eyes, towards the audience. On stage, the               performers circulate and share urns filled with water. In previous               scenes, the urns were empty, yet in this final scene the urns overflow               with water and the performers splash each other with the innocence               of children. Implying a rebirth through this use of water as a symbol               of life, the performers then descend into the audience and ritualistically               offer water as a partaking of this new life. In Kolkata, HIV is               most often associated with the gay community;[28] through a female               portrayal of an HIV positive life, the performance forces audience               members to recognize the wide range of people HIV affects. In addition,               <em>Positive Lives</em> suggests the universal vulnerability to               HIV; not necessarily a &#8220;gay&#8221; disease, it suggests that               the heterosexual community is also at risk. </p>            <p class="second">While the bodily gestures and dance actions are               integral to the thematic importance of the performances, the employment               of constraining objects also becomes a curious investigation into               its deeper meanings. The constant presence of restrictive objects,               such as rope, cloth and separators reflects societal stereotypes               homosexuals and HIV positive people are forced to endure. As the               rope becomes the way to control and overpower homosexuality, red               cloth is also used to compound the ideas of control and restraint               in the performances. In <em>Positive Lives</em> the red cloth becomes               a symbol of the connection between mother and child, of life and               support, yet at the same time it pulls the expectant mother in different               directions, forcing her to climb, straddle and dance around it.               Instead of a constant support system, even the life force acts as               a restrictive agent on oppressed communities. </p>            <p class="second">Gender theorist Judith Halberstam examines the idea               of queer space in her most recent book <em>In A Queer Time and Space</em>.               Analyzing spaces where the queer body regains identity and stages               itself as an oppositional force to the mainstream, she writes &#8220;queer               space refers to the place-making practices within postmodernism               in which queer people engage&#8230;it describes the new understanding               of space enabled by the production of queer counterpublics.&#8221;[29]               This suggests not only a space for queers, but also a space where               the queer body &#8220;performs.&#8221; Through the manipulation               of a queer space, queer bodies can create oppositional spaces or               what Halberstam labels &#8220;geographies of resistance.&#8221;[30]</p>            <p class="second">Halberstam&#8217;s ideas of queer communities using               spaces and places as a means of resistance parallels the way in               which queer communities in Kolkata use mainstream space, such as               a theater, to rethink representation. The theatrical performances               are not only activist in theme&#8212;they also convert spaces historically               attached to acceptable aesthetics and employ them as spaces for               education about pertinent social issues. Transforming the theater               into a space for queer activism and taking advantage of a cultural               platform highly respected in Kolkata, these performers push populations               to acknowledge the queer movement not only in extreme and defiant               situations such as pride marches, but also in more subtle and nuanced               forms that can be called theatrical activism. </p>            <p class="second">Yet vital questions should be raised here when discussing               the importance of theater spaces: what kind of audience do these               plays reach and what kind of impact are they actually having on               the queer situation in Kolkata? Unlike the 1999-style march that               is conducive to raising awareness among the unaware and general               population, theater and other &#8220;attended&#8221; events are               conducive to maintaining and deepening awareness among those already               sensitive to the issue though perhaps unaware of the specifics of               the movement. While the company aimed to reach broader audiences,               performing on stages in proper theaters already narrows the audience.               Upper-middle class communities have the luxury and privilege to               go to the theater, while communities in struggling lower socio-economic               standing lack the resources to provide for their families as well               as take them to theatrical events. Additionally, because the performances               use English as their medium of communication, how much of the Indian               population does this exclude? The illiterate and non-English-speaking               communities are unfortunately also left out of being able to watch               and understand the narratives of the performances. An area still               under-researched is the impact of theater performances outside the               spaces of conventional theater, such as vernacular street theater,               and the efficacy of these performances in combating these same stigmas               and stereotypes and reaching homeless and/or lower socio-economic               communities. </p>            <p class="second">Sapphire productions, however, feels confident in               its Bengali impact. India Today reported that the company felt emboldened               by the new consciousness sweeping Bengal, where gays and lesbians               have begun to find greater acceptance.[31] Kolkata is witnessing               a sudden dynamic burst of activity among the gay population; in               2003, when Kolkata&#8217;s gay pride march reached 100 participants,               &#8220;the state government, which would have normally frowned on               such events, gave them unprecedented police protection.&#8221;[32]</p>            <p class="second">Yet the obstacles encountered by the dance company               reinforce the fact that India still remains sexually conservative               and homophobic in many ways. The increased reactions against these               acts of &#8220;sexual defamation&#8221; from the Hindu right wing,               such as the VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) association, only fuel the               activist fire. VHP party president Vishnu Hari Dalmiya commented               &#8220;making homosexuality legal will be an attack on Indian society.               For Hindus, this kind of behavior is not just against nature, it               is against our culture.&#8221;[33] The VHP, an organization known               for its infamous statement that &#8220;a cow&#8217;s life is more               sacred than a human&#8217;s life,&#8221; has tried to ban homosexuality               internationally. In 2000, the VHP protested against the British               government&#8217;s repeal of Section 28 of their penal code, which               stated homosexuality was an abnormality.[34] Gaining much notoriety               for its destruction of M.F. Hussain&#8217;s nude drawings of Hindu               goddesses, the VHP incited violent demonstrations of vandalization               and destruction of his artwork. This anti-Hussain platform, according               to Guha-Thakurta, further shows the kind of &#8220;terror, censorship               and punitive action that sustains the cultural politics of the Hindu               right that does not spare the average artist, citizen or celebrity.&#8221;[35]               Yet in Kolkata, the queer movement has used the negative momentum               from right-wing politics, such as the VHP, to increase their own               political backing. Additionally, the absence of the VHP movement               in Kolkata has helped the activist movement. </p>            <p class="second">The future of the movement will be difficult to               predict because of the ever-shifting political and social atmosphere               in India. It will be interesting to examine the fluid positive and               negative relationships between Western and Indian attitudes towards               sexuality, political expressions (such as marches) and art and its               continual effect on queer activist techniques. Postcolonial India               continuously struggles with new cultural paradigms resulting from               globalization. The activist scene has also used these new paradigms,               such as the importance of marches, to further its own cause. At               this crucial moment when specific localities are tackling political               and social issues in the public sphere, it is important to recognize               how social change benefits from creative and imaginative pathways,               and how aesthetic movements become more charged when they engage               with social ideologies. Performance activism, therefore, will be               integral for this change and development. Through theater, communities               will have the opportunity to impact and to give a voice to often               marginalized, stereotyped and minority communities. </p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Siddarth Puri</strong> is a graduate student               in the department of Art History at UCLA.

Gautam Bham comments, &#8220;Communities               in India associate this category [LGBT] with middle class, educated               and globally connected people in India.&#8221; Stemming from issues               of identity politics and nationalism, the category LGBT is seen               as a Western imposition onto Indian lifestyles. For example, terms               such as &#8220;gay&#8221; are reserved for the &#8220;wealthy upper               middle class, white collar men who speak English.&#8221; While there               is not a single term in Hindi that encompasses communities outside               of the heterosexual space, &#8220;queer,&#8221; for both Indian               and Western scholarship, becomes an umbrella term that comprises               communities practicing activities against the heterosexual model,               such as marriage and procreation, as well as communities who aim               to challenge heteronormative ideas of sexuality and gender. Operating               outside of the heterosexually anointed &#8220;norm&#8221; of sexuality,               &#8220;queer&#8221; offers a broader definition and less stringent               categorical boundaries (Interview with Gautham Bham, 9/4/2004).<br>              [12] Bina Fernandez, <em>Humanjasi: A Resource Book on Lesbian,               Gay and Bisexual Rights in India</em> (Mumbai: Combat Law Publications,               2002), 10.<br>              [13] Tapati Guha-Thakurta, <em>Monuments, Objects and Histories:               Institutions of Art in Colonial and Postcolonial India</em> (New               York: Columbia University Press, 2004), 14.<br>              [14] Jyoti Sharma, &#8220;Section 377 is Misused to Persecute Gays&#8221;               <em>The Delhi Times</em>, September 6, 2004, A2.<br>              [15] Shaleen Rakesh, &#8220;Blame the Law: Section 377 Drives Gays               into a Twilight Zone,&#8221; <em>The Times of India</em>, August               31, 2004, B2.<br>              [16] <em>Hindustani Times</em>, &#8220;HC Dismisses Plea on Homosexuality,&#8221;               September 2, 2004, A3.<br>              [17] <em>The Statesman</em>, [Kolkata]: http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=3&amp;theme=&amp;usrsess=1&amp;id=18938,               accessed on 10/6/2004. <br>              [18] Interview with Rafiquel Haque Dowjah, 9/13/2004.<br>              [19] Peter Van Der Veer, <em>Imperial Encounters: Religion and Modernity               in India and Britain</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press,               2001), 72.<br>              [20] Ibid, 15. <br>              [21] In addition, Mrinalini Sinha&#8217;s examinations of colonial               discourses on sexuality reveal a curious observation between homosexuality               and the masculine men of the colony: &#8220;homosexual practices               were associated with favoured &#8216;manly&#8217; and &#8216;virile&#8217;               native races rather than the effeminate Bengali&#8221; (Sinha, 19).               This ironic colonial discourse links virility with homosexuality               and effeminacy with an overly enervated heterosexuality. Sinha goes               on to talk about how the Age of Consent Controversy in 1891 showed               the &#8220;lack of manly-self control&#8221; (Sinha, 19) by the               Bengali man. Sinha notes how women of the Bengali household were               encouraging the early and possibly premature sexual relations of               young couples. The men did not stand up and fight for the age of               consent bill and therefore were seen as being dominated by the women               of the household and described as &#8220;not masters of their own               houses&#8221; by British writers in Kolkata newspapers (Sinha, 158).               <br>              [22] Integration Society is a queer organization in Kolkata and               was the group that started the pride marches.
