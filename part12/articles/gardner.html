With the willed intensity of a method actor utterly               submerged in a role, the fiercely territorial Kulik, hunched low               to the ground, growled, barked, and generally menaced startled pedestrians               until police, never known for their tolerance of the unusual, broke               the power of the strange performance by applying a pair of cuffs               to the very human wrists. On film, the last record of the performance,               Kulik is escorted, this time as a man standing on two legs, into               the back of a waiting police wagon. </p>            <p class="second">This performance, entitled <em>I Can&#8217;t Keep               Silent Anymore (Stop English Cow&#8217;s Genocide)</em>, was ostensibly               a politically motivated gesture, giving voice to the voiceless,               in the debate over the extermination of British cattle herds during               the height of the Mad Cow Disease epidemic. At first blush, the               scene is ridiculous: a naked man hounding tourists, salarymen, and,               if the political point is correctly understood, harassing the odd               politicians like any good lobbyist with a cause to pitch. To the               calf linked to his neck, Kulik was both guard dog and would-be savior               on behalf of the calf&#8217;s cousins in England. If verisimilitude               is the point of the performance, then Kulik fails miserably because,               quite simply, as a dog he comes up short. In none of his performances               does he attempt to alter or disguise his human appearance with fur               or elongated incisors. His humanness is still intact, albeit subdued               in a performance eradicating the critical distance between animal               and man.</p>            <p class="second">But what is one to make of this performance? Is               it a public stunt devoid of real import beyond spectacle? Is the               artist-dog merely a vagrant character actor wanting only a script?               Kulik does belong to that class of public performers whose art closely               resembles what Richard Sennett would approvingly call &#8220;confrontational               theater,&#8221; whose sheer momentum pairs maniacal energy emanating               from the performer and the abrasive circumstances that arise from               a willed disruption of the placid surface of the quotidian. To Sennett&#8217;s               mind this approach, this sustained anarchy, is less condescending&#8212;and               more effective&#8212;than the carefully cultivated educational atmosphere               of your typical museum that arranges art pedagogically, section               by section, period by period.[1]</p>            <p class="second">Unsurprisingly, pedestrians in Brussels seemed less               enthusiastic, as they offered him a wide berth. Unless clued in               to the fact that this was an artistic performance, they could be               forgiven if they drew the conclusion that this was a man who had               taken leave of his senses. Danger for performer and audience provides               one of the main thrusts for this type of art, as it was for Chris               Burden when he had an assistant shoot him during a performance.               (Kulik himself was hospitalized after cutting himself with glass               during one performance.) The outcome of every performance is never               clear and the audience is exposed to a certain danger. If they are               foolish enough to ignore the posted warnings or wander too close               to the fiercely territorial Kulik, a spectator can face a mauling&#8212;and               in a few cases they have. Kulik is rarely solo on these occasions,               and is often accompanied during performances by Mila Bredikhina,               who serves as artistic partner, explicator, collaborator, wife,               and &#8220;trainer.&#8221; To judge by his behavior, unacceptable               to even the most forgiving pet owner, Kulik sorely needs the discipline.             </p>            <p class="second">Another doggy performance, 1997&#8217;s <em><a href="http://slought.org/img/archive1/1140%2Bpress1.jpg" class="link_underline">I               Bite America and America Bites Me</a></em></span>, brought Kulik               to Deitch Projects in New York City. Before taking to the gallery               and his appointed &#8220;cage,&#8221; Bredikhina took him for a               walk, leashed, through Brooklyn, where he followed the line of previous               performances, never breaking character; a rather unruly presence               to those unsuspecting. Once safely in his cage at the Deitch, visitors               were invited to feed, observe, and, provided they were brave and               willing to don the requisite protective gear, to visit and pet him               within the confines of the gallery&#8217;s constructed cell. Quiet               some moments, affectionate, even tender, during others, Kulik still               mounted the occasional unprovoked attack, always leading with his               human mouth, as if to issue a reminder that his domestication was,               at best, a work in progress. If &#8220;theater happens at the moment               in which a feeling passes between the actor and the audience,&#8221;               then this was a performance desperate to conjure theatricality.[2]               Never once in this or any other performances does Kulik raise his               hand to bring the humiliation to an end or beg for a glass of water               in a human language. His will towards transformation is near total.</p>            <p class="second">His art, including his non-performance sculptures               and paintings, uses animals and the natural world for inspiration.               But his act is not only directed towards a non-Russian audience.               He has taken his art back to Russia and made it political, running               for the presidency as a member of the newly minted Party of Animals,               becoming in the short history of Russian democracy, quite possibly,               the only candidate to sport horns and, perhaps in a nod to decorum,               clothes.</p>            <p class="second">Most of Kulik&#8217;s art mines the same creative               vein with animals as his totemic obsession. He has appeared as Pavlov&#8217;s               dog in Russia and as an attack dog in Sweden. In one performance               that represented something of a departure from the doggy-as-artist               motif, Kulik covered himself with reflective mirrors before mounting               a narrow platform far above a crowd, mimicking in function, if not               strictly in appearance, a dance club&#8217;s mirror ball. These               performances have garnered him a place at major international exhibitions,               including the Manifesta I in Rotterdam, Holland (1996), the Biennal               of Istanbul, Turkey (1997), and the Venice Biennial (1997). </p>            <p class="second">Kulik&#8217;s <em>oeuvre</em>, while perhaps dubiously               successful in terms of political significance (the legislation before               the European Union, for example, passed), nonetheless illustrates               a disruptive trend challenging the curatorial preference for domesticated               art and structured performance. Where, after all, does the artist-as-animal               belong? Indoors? Outdoors? Kulik wears the leash for a reason and               curators have taken note. </p>            <p class="second">Since its beginning, performance art generally and               body art specifically has been notoriously difficult to slot within               the traditional white walled gallery or teaching museum. Performance               art cannot be hung; it cannot be mounted on a pedestal. Indeed,               obsolescence is a crucial component of the performance. The artist               gets up, walks away. And the larger audience, beyond and after the               event, experiences the act in miniature, through reconstructions               on other types of media. For most performances pieces like Kulik&#8217;s               exist only on tape or a processed medium like video or through documents,               catalogues, or, perhaps, rumor and word of mouth.</p>            <p class="second">Performances like these raise a critical question:               Is the museum or gallery sufficient to reflect the political or               social significance of Kulik&#8217;s works, or for that matter any               charged performance? (This is not simply a theoretical or academic               question for Kulik; it is also a practical one. Organizers of one               show in Stockholm, although fully aware of the trouble Kulik stirred               up during a previous show in Zurich, nonetheless called the authorities               to intervene when Kulik began to bite the assembled visitors and               art critics.)[3] Like many challenges to the established art world               order during the 1960s, the fundamental debate turns on cultivating               spaces large enough to house the range of contemporary expression,               from conservative to avant-garde, while exhibiting works encompassing               a political or social dimension to &#8220;reflect the changes taking               place in art and society at large while also meeting the expectations               and challenges posed by such an undertaking.&#8221;[4] And the challenge,               especially in politically contentious times, is to reconcile the               disparate demands. </p>            <p class="second">Of course, edginess is nothing new in the tradition               of performance art, or, as it is alternately known, action art or               live art. Artists have taken risks&#8212;physically, emotionally,               and spiritually&#8212;at least since Dada&#8217;s heyday of Tristan               Tzara and the Cabaret Voltaire in Vienna. In this genre, where open-ended               performances can last days or even weeks, artists willfully endure               privation and worse as they throw themselves&#8212;often literally&#8212;bodily               into the work. Critics like Roberta Smith have already noted the               strong influence of conceptual artists on Kulik, most notably Joseph               Beuys, whose fascination with shamanism and the natural world preoccupied               his work.[5]</p>            <p class="second">Beuys&#8217; performance <em><a href="http://www.greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Images/Ecology/america-xl.jpeg" class="link_underline">I               Like America and America Likes Me</a>, </em>for example, shares               more than a near identical name with Kulik&#8217;s own piece. In               this 1974 performance, Beuys, a German, flew into New York from               Europe, and swathed himself in felt before taking an ambulance to               the gallery, where he was placed in a cage with a wild coyote for               three days before returning to the airport, again covered in a fresh               coat of felt. Not once did his feet touch American soil, nor does               it feel necessary to the overall performance for him to have done               so. After all, his performance embodies his ambivalence about his               experience of America. Here was a European cynical about American               imperialism abroad, particularly in the still raging Vietnam conflict,               coming to the heart of United States for a performance and dialogue               both tender and dangerous. In this dialogue, Beuys did not need               to touch America to engage or approach it. </p>            <p class="second">Unlike Beuys, Kulik&#8217;s art is peculiarly nationalistic.               He is a Russian dog. Kulik, along with other Russian artists like               Ilya Kabakov, is a member of the new breed emerging from the welter               of &#8216;90s Russia, and it shows; it is practically impossible               to separate these artists from their political origins. After all,               it was only a few years before the performance in Brussels, on December               26, 1991, that Russia faced a national and lasting trauma in communism&#8217;s               collapse. The hammer and sickle, ubiquitous symbols of communism               since the Revolution, were removed and replaced with the tri-color               flag of a new Federation in a bloodless revolution. After decades               of nuclear brinkmanship and a sustained global cold war with West,               it wasn&#8217;t the invention of a more powerful missile or a single               move on the geopolitical chessboard. Instead, the Soviet Union declared               itself finished without a single shot fired or bomb exploded, done               in by internal inconsistencies instead of a final battle with the               West. For a proud people accustomed to superpower status, the humiliation               of its very public collapse was intensified by its being simultaneously               broadcast into Western living rooms. Much to the consternation of               some, the revolution was televised.</p>            <p class="second">Incipient democracy in Russia embodied a paradox               of progress. Russians enjoyed freedoms undreamt of even during the               sunniest moments of <em>glasnost</em>, and the government is righting               itself after the Soviet collapse and beginning to reassert its influence.               Nonetheless, today social ills are laid bare. Besides persistent,               gnawing poverty grinding down huge swaths of the population, shocking               declines in the life expectancy (vodka plays no small part in this               grim statistic), corruption, cronyism, rampant crime, and the vast               disparities in wealth between the haves and have-nots serve as reminders               that democracy is no guarantor of social equity. </p>            <p class="second">Such messy national politics are reflected in Kulik&#8217;s               unstructured, violent performances. Indeed, Russia&#8217;s rich               artistic tradition has a long history of conspicuously incorporating               political elements into art, often with the state&#8217;s blessing.               In Russia&#8217;s other revolution in 1917, artists like Rodchenko               and others bore the standard of an overtly political Constructivism,               which was suppressed and replaced by the conscientiously less obscure               Socialist Realism. This art&#8217;s place was as propaganda, communicating               and reifying the communist script for the masses. Kulik, unlike               those artists, is not celebrating the birth of a new era or international               solidarity with the same zeal (or forced enthusiasm) of artists               conscripted into the service of international socialism. He instead               captures the <em>fin de si&egrave;cle</em> attitude pervading &#8217;90s               Russia. Kulik leaves open-ended whether the Russian dog man he conjures               is a confirmation of the Western conception of the crumbled superpower.               If the menace of the Soviet Union has diminished, he suggests, perhaps               the wildness of this nuclear-tipped former adversary has been domesticated.             </p>            <p class="second">Kulik is quite reflective about his own work, which               is somewhat surprising given the fact that, at first glance, his               performances typically resort to a shocking personal devolution               shunning personal rationalizations (at least of the humanistic variety).               The ideas that emerge from him and through his wife, who also doubles               as an interpreter, is foursquare behind the idea of animal liberation               and rights leaning towards radicalism. To return once again to Sennett,               he opines &#8220;An artist is accepting himself as an authority,               a commodity when he&#8217;s able to talk about the development of               his work. That kind of self-consciousness indicates he has made               himself fit for museums.&#8221;[6] This is part of the paradox of               Kulik&#8217;s work&#8212;the tension between the verbal and non-verbal,               the violent and the rational&#8212;that muddies Sennett&#8217;s               description.</p>            <p class="second">On the one hand, Kulik-as-dog embodies a non-humanistic               or, to put it more generously, a post-humanistic reason, reliant               upon gestures that are non-verbal yet communicative, which are effective               at getting &#8220;meaning&#8221; across, even it invites more interpretations               than answers. Kulik-as-artist and Kulik-as-dog (if such a distinction               is warranted) is engaged in an artistic dialogue with the audience.               And as a Russian dog, his works and concentrated obsessions reflect               the national trauma and the wildness that a skeptical West projects               onto an &#8220;undomesticated&#8221; East. </p>            <p class="second">But the performances do not entirely reflect a negative               dialectic. From an ideological standpoint, Kulik proudly places               himself at the vanguard of a nascent post-human epistemology. As               Renata Salecl has pointed out, in Kulik&#8217;s performance in particular,               violence does not necessarily silence or delimit communication;               it acts as another avenue of expression. &#8220;Dialogue and communication,&#8221;               she acknowledges, &#8220;can involve a great deal of violence. But,               on the other hand, someone can understand violence and destruction               as a way of communicating.&#8221;[7] It is little surprise, then,               that so many of the interventions of artists from the East in the               context of the West are imbued with real or implied violence. After               all, their respective cultures have communicated that way for years.               Why shouldn&#8217;t artists? Communication, if it is possible at               all, is conducted through an orchestrated violence, miles away from               a Habermassian ideal speech situation.[8]</p>            <p class="second">If, as Richard Sennett believes, &#8220;fear is               the measure of a passive public,&#8221; then the engagement of the               artist-dog and all the attendant feeling of anxiety generated from               the performance could be an antidote to the symptom of ambivalence.[9]               Hans-Ulrich Obrist, curator of the Musee d&#8217;Art de la Ville               de Paris, for example, encourages a more freewheeling, anarchic               approach to an exhibition&#8212;an approach more amenable to the               wild dynamic of Kulik and other like-minded artists, curators, and               gallery owners looking to shake off the malaise of good taste and               all that implies: pedagogy, closed meanings, and submissiveness.               &#8220;Instead of certitude,&#8221; Obrist observed that the best               exhibitions express &#8220;connective possibilities. The question               of evolutionary displays. An ongoing life of exhibitions. Exhibitions               as complex, dynamic learning systems with feedback loops, basically               to renounce the obsolete idea of the curator as a master planner.&#8221;               [10] The crucial word here is <em>possibility</em>. Kulik gestures               towards expressions that generate possibilities at once political               and personal. Still, it is the brave curator who invites an unmuzzled               Kulik into a gallery. But in a violent world where contact of East               and West generates conflict more often than sustained cross-cultural               dialogue, Kulik&#8217;s willingness to act the dog seems a perfectly               rational way to bridge the divide.</p>            <p class="second">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="second"><strong>Stephen Gardner</strong> is pursuing his               master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
