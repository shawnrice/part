The Enlightenment notion               that art has a role to play in politics has been repeatedly revised               during the two subsequent centuries with varying degrees of optimism               and skepticism, but it is still very much with us&#8212;even if               only, as I argue in my contribution, as a &#8220;specter&#8221;               that continually posits, in the words of Jacques Derrida, &#8220;the               principle of some <em>responsibility</em>, beyond all living present,               within that which disjoins the living present, before the ghosts               of those who are not yet born or who are already dead&#8230;&#8221;[1]             </p>            <p class="second">We are cleaved from Enlightenment, modernist and               avant-garde political art by our consciousness of their collective               &#8220;failure&#8221; or incompletion. Before this historical burden,               there are two scholarly options: to unearth lesser-known initiatives               towards efficacy in the art of the past, and/or to scrutinize the               contemporary possibilities for politically efficacious art appropriate               to our own historical moment. Toward these two ends, the contributors               to this issue explore a diverse selection of work and historic and               geographical contexts. Toby Norris reviews the heated and broad               debate over politics in art in France&#8217;s turbulent 1930s. Kris               Belden-Adams, writing about the same period, discusses the American               context&#8212;the last moment in which our government was truly               committed to funding art. My text theorizes the effect of the 1960s               and 1970s on our present art-historical thinking. Stephen Gardner               looks at the 1990s in newly &#8220;democratized&#8221; Russia with               his discussion of the performance artist Oleg Kulik (an excellent               example of the adaptation of 1960s/1970s art practices in the present).               Katherine Gressel is also positioned towards this decade in her               consideration of the socially oriented, collaborative performance               projects of Suzanne Lacy. Siddarth Puri traces the history of queer               performance in India&#8212;a hybrid of Western conventions and a               specifically local response to a sociopolitical issue. Natilee Harren               eyes the mega-exhibitions of the 00&#8217;s in her discussion of               the <em>Utopia Station</em> project, while Amanda Brown critiques               a particular case: the New York Museum of Modern Art&#8217;s recent               acknowledgment of contemporary &#8220;Islamic art&#8221; in last               spring&#8217;s <em>Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking</em>               show. Alan Moore, who like myself intuits a &#8220;ghost&#8212;which               we may suspect is &#8217;68-style activism,&#8221; outlines the               recent artistic tendency to blend art and activism in quasi-academic               settings. Finally, overviews of the recent <em>Portraits of Grief</em>               project that was installed in the CUNY Graduate Center galleries               last year and an interview with the editors of the blog <em>American               Coprophagia</em> demonstrate possibilities for new media in the               recent American political climate. Contrary to those who would claim               that both art and art history are apolitical realms today and that               critical theory is &#8220;dead&#8221; in terms of use value, the               heterogeneous methods and subject matter herein attest that the               problematic of efficacy remains a trenchant one for both scholars               and practitioners of art.</p>            <p class="second">New York, NY<br>              March 1, 2007</p>            <p class="second"> [1] Jacques Derrida, <em>Specters of Marx: The               State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning, and the New International</em>,               trans.
